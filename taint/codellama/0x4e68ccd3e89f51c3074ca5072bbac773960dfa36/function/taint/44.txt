The variable 'self' is a storage reference, which means that it points to a location in storage where the data is stored. In this case, the 'observe' function is marked as 'internal', which indicates that the access to the storage is limited to within the contract. Therefore, even though the reference to ' self' can be passed as an argument to other functions, those functions cannot modify the contents of the referenced storage location.
