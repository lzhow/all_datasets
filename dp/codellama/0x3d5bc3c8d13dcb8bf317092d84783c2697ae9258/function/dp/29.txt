  
No, the `var` variable in `borrrowFres` is not dependent on ` seizetok`en in`seiz`e.

The reason is that the`var `variable is defined inside the scope of the borrowfresh function, while the seizable variable is a parameter of a different function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
