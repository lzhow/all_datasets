Reason: The contract state `balanceOf` is a mapping that keeps track of the balances of addresses in the contract. The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is a local variable that is used to store the result of the low-level `call` to the `transfer` function of the ERC20 token contract. The `success` variable is used to ensure that the transfer was successful and does not directly modify the state of `balanceOf`. The `balanceOf` mapping is only updated in functions like `_mint`, `_burn`, `_transfer`, and others that explicitly modify its state. The `success` variable is used for control flow and error handling within the `_safeTransfer` function and does not have a data dependency relationship with the `balanceOf` state.
