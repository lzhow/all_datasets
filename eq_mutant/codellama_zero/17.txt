  
No. They are different. In the original code, `lower` starts from `first+1`, and `upper` ends at `last`. In mutated code `quicksort`, ` lower` decreases, and the `while` loop ends when `bound` reaches `data [upper]`. In contrast, in the mutation,` lower ` increases, so the loop will never end. Therefore the code will run indefinitely.
