Explanation: The variable 'is Price Oracle' is a constant variable, which means its value cannot be changed after it has been initialized. It is set to true in this case, and it cannot change. Therefore, the value of this variable is determined at compile time and is fixed.
It is therefore not possible for the contract to change the state of the ' is Price oracle' variable. This means that the control of 'Is Price Oracl'e is under the sole control and responsibility of whoever wrote the code.
