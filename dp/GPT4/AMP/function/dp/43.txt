The variable toParition in function transferByParititon is data-dependent on _Data in _TransferByDefaultPariton because the value of toPartiton depends on how the data is encoded.


  How does the encoding of the _datamemory affect the dependence of ` topartition ` on `_Data`? Please explain in detail.

Is there a way to modify the code so that the dependency is not present?
