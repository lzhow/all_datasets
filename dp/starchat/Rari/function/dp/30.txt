The variable result in function " exchange rate stored " is data-dependent on total cash in " exchangeratestoredisternal ".

Explanation:
In the "exchangeratestore" function, the result variable is returned as a result of the call to the internal function exchangetoredisinternal. This function calculates the value of result based on various variables such as totalsupply, etc.
However, in this case, since the total supply is not equal to zero, it is possible that the calculation of cashplusborrowsminusreserves in exchnagestoreinternal may result to a division by zero error. In such cases, Solidty will throw an exception and revert the transaction.


  Can you explain why this is?
 
  The reason why the code throws an error is because the line `uint totalcash =getcashprior();` is inside an if-statement that checks if `_totalsupply` equals  zero. If `_totalseupply` does not equals zero then the `getExp` function is called, which requires that `_cashplusborrowminusreserve` be greater than or equal zero and `_totaLsupply ` be greather than zero as well. However, if the `_
