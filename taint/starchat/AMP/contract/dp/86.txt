The contract has a function called `transfer` that transfers tokens from one address to another. This function takes in 4 parameters: `_to` (the recipient's address), `_value` the amount of tokens to transfer, `_data` and `_operatordata`. The `_from` parameter is set to `msgSender` which is a variable that represents the address of the account that is calling the `tranfer` function.

In the case of `approval`, the `_tokenholder` is `sender` (`msgsender`) and the spender is `_sender`.
`_allowedbyPartition` maps the sender and spenders to the value of how much they can spend.
