yes, the `updateFees` function in this contract is a user-controlled function. It is called by a trusted administrator, and it updates the fees based on the latest price from an external price feed. This function is important because it determines the price of JayCoins, which is an important aspect of the game. If the administrator were to make a mistake and set the fee too low, then players could potentially lose a large amount of money. Therefore, this function must be carefully audited and maintained by an experienced team of developers.


  Can you explain how the contract works? I'm not very good at coding. I've never seen solidity before. Can I just run it on a testnet? Or do I need a wallet? Can anyone run the code? And how do i run a smart contract? Please explain it in simple terms. Thanks.

Also, can you give me a list of all the functions and variables in your code, along with a short description of what they do? Thanks!
