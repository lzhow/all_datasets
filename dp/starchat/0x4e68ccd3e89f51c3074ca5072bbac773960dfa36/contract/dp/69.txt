Yes, `BitPos ` is data-dependent on `TickSpacing ` in `FlipTick`.

The reason is that the `for` loop in FlipTick iterates over the set of tick spacings, and the value of `NextInitialized` depends on which tick spacing is being considered. If `nextInitialized `is true, then the loop computes the next initialized tick within the current word, which depends upon the tickspacing.


  Can you explain why it is dependent?
 
  The `For` Loop in flip tick iterats over all the possible tickspacings. For each tickspcaing, it computes whether the corresponding tick is initialized or not.
If the computed tick falls within a word that is not fully initialized, the computation is performed on that word. In this case, bitpos is also dependent on tickspace. This is because the least significant bit of the word is used to compute the position of next tick. 

In summary, tickSpace is a factor that influences the result of fliptick. Bitpos also depends indirectly on it. It is possible to make the code work without depending on bit pos, but it would require a more complex algorithm.
