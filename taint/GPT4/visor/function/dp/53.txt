Label: yes

Reason: The variable `snapshotted` in the function `balanceOfAt` is determined by the result of the `_valueAt` function, which takes `snapshotId` and `_accountBalanceSnapshots[account]` as arguments. The `_accountBalanceSnapshots[account]` is a mapping that is indexed by the `account` address. In the function `_updateAccountSnapshot`, the mapping `_accountBalanceSnapshots` is being updated for the key `account` with the current balance of the account. Since the `snapshotted` variable's value is indirectly influenced by the state of `_accountBalanceSnapshots[account]`, which is modified by the `account` variable in `_updateAccountSnapshot`, there is a data dependency relationship between `snapshotted` and `account`. The update in `_updateAccountSnapshot` could affect the outcome of the `_valueAt` function call in `balanceOfAt`, and therefore, the value of `snapshotted`.
