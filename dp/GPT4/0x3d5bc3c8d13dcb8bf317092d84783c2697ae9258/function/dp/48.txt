Reason: The variable `_totalSupply` is assigned the value of the state variable `totalSupply` at the beginning of the function `exchangeRateStoredInternal` and is not modified afterwards. It is used to determine the control flow of the function (i.e., whether to return `initialExchangeRateMantissa` or proceed with further calculations). The variable `mathErr` is used to capture the result of the `addThenSubUInt` and `getExp` function calls, which are related to calculating `cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves` and `exchangeRate`, respectively. The value of `mathErr` does not influence the value of `_totalSupply`, nor does `_totalSupply` influence the value of `mathErr`. Their values are determined independently of each other, and there is no data dependency relationship between them.
