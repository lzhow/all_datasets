The contract variable  `_ totalPartions` is not dependent on variable _ data in function  ` transferbyPartion`.
This is because the  _totalpartitions variable is defined outside the transfer by partition function and is only used to keep track of the total number of partitions. It is never modified or used in any way that would depend on _ _Data. Therefore, the two are independent.
