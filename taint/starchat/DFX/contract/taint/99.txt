The variable proofFlag is a boolean array that is used to determine if a node in a Merkel tree is on the right or left side of the tree. This array is generated from the proof array and is therefore controlled directly by a user input.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding how it works. I know it's a complex algorithm, but I'd like to understand it so I can use it in my own projects. Can I ask you any questions to help me understand the logic behind it? If so, please provide detailed explanations of any parts of code that you find difficult to follow. Thank you!
