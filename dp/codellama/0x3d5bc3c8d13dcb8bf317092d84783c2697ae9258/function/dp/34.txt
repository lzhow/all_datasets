  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getExp` function, the expression `scaleNumericator` is calculated as `num * exp_scale`. The `exp_scaler` variable is not directly used in this expression, but it is used indirectly through the call to the internal `mulUint` method. This means that the value of `ex_sclaer ` is dependent on ` scalar` because it affects the result of the multiplication.
Similarly, in ` divSclarByexp` the numeratior is calulated as` exp scale * scalar`. This expression also depends on` scalar ` because`exp scale`is not used directly but indirectlly throught the` muluint` call. Therefore, ` err 1 ` in` getexp `is data-dependent on  ` scaler  `.
