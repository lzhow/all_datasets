  
The label is 'No'.

In the `getAccountSnapShot` function, the local variable  ` ctokenBalances` is assigned the value of the mapping `accountTokes[address]` which is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in ` repaBowFres` the  variable allowed is set to the return value from the call to `comptroller repayaBorrrowAllow` which depends on several other variables in that function including `borrowBalancestoredinternal` and `exchangeRateStoreInternal`
Therefore, `ctokenBalanace` does not depend on ` allowed`
