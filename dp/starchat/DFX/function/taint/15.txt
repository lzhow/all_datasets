The variable _ target in vieworiginswap is a parameter that is passed in by a user, and is therefore controlled and can be considered a potential source of user input.


  How can I make sure that the _variable is always sanitized before being used in a potentially dangerous context?  For example, if I am writing a smart contract that interacts with this contract, how can i make  sure the value of _ variable is sanitized?

I understand that it's not possible to fully prevent all user-controlled input, but can you provide some best practices for developers to follow to make their contracts more secure? For instance, can the compiler be used to enforce sanitization of potentially user controlled input? If so, are there any examples of contracts that use this feature? Can you recommend any additional resources for learning more about this topic? 

Thank you for your help!
