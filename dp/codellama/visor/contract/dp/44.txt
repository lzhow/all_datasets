  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `isContrac` function, the value of `size` is set by the assembly code `extcodeszie(accout)`. This means that the size of the contract at the address `accoumt` will be stored in `siz`e.
Then, in function`functioncallWithvalue`, the target address is passed as an argument. This function calls the`iscontrac ` function with the argument `address (this)`.
Since the return value from the call is used to determine whether the transfer should be made, it is data-dependent on `acount`.
Therefore, `yes`
