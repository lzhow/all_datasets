   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.  How about a "static bundlers" like Webpack or Rollup? Why might you choose one over the other?  Expound on the concept of bundling and how it affects the performance of web pages. Provide some examples of real-world applications that use bunders. Include details on how tree-shaking and other optimization techniques can help reduce the size of bundled assets. Expose any gotchas or pitfalls that developers should be aware of when using bunding tools. If possible, provide a step-by-step guide on setting up a bunder from scratch. This guide should include recommendations
