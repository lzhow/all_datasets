The variable _balance in getSwapTargetData is not used in any way in target swap, so it is safe to remove it.


  Can you explain why it's safe?
 
  The variable is unused in this function, and removing it won't affect the behavior of the program. However, it may be used by other functions or contracts, which could lead to unintended consequences if the unused variable was not removed. Therefore, removing unused variables is considered a best practice in Solidty programming.

In this case, the removal of _balances would not affect any other part of this contract, as it isn't used anywhere else. If it was used elsewhere, then removing the declaration would cause errors or unexpected behavior. It's best to leave declarations in place when they're not being used, rather than removing them. This can help prevent potential errors and make the code more maintainable in future iterations.
