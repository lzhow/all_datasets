The contract variable `curvedeposits` is not directly dependent on `_ deposited`. The `propotionaldeposition` function is called, which returns the number of curves minted and the depositions. These values are then assigned to `curedeposition` and ` deposition`, respectively. Therefore, the value of ` whitlistedDepositioned` does not change.
