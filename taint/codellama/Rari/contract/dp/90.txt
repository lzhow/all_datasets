  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the constructor function, the `delegateTo` function is called with the arguments `implementation_`, `abi. encodeWith Signature ("initialize (address , address ,address  , string ,string ,uint 2 5 6 , uint 1 9 3 7 )", underlying _, comptroler _, interest rate model _, name _, symbol _, reserve factor mantissa _, admin fee mantiss a_)` . This function call passes the address of the implementation contract as the first argument, which is stored in `implementa tion_`.
  The second argument is a byte array that contains the ABI-encoded data for the initialization function of `CDelegat ionStorage`. This data includes the addresses of other contracts, such as `underlying_ `, `comp troller _`, and `interest rate mode l_ `.
   The third argument to ` delegate To` is `false`, which indicates that the call should not be made reentrantly.
    The fourth argument ` become Implementation Data` contains a reference to the data that will be passed to `_set Implement ation Safe` when the contract is initialized. This is where the dependency between ` com ptor l _` and  ` be come Imple mentation Data ` is established.  When the `_ set Impl ementation Sa fe` method is invoked, it will use the value of  `_be comeImplemen tationData_  to set the  _imple men tati on_ field of C Delegation Storage. Therefore, when ` _be com eImplementati o nData _ ` changes, so does the field `_im plementation _`.  This means that ` comp t r o l l er _  is data-dependent on  be com ep l emen ta t ionData`.
