  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the constructor of the `ER1C697proxy` contract, the `_upgradetoAndcall` function takes two arguments: `newimplementation` and ` data`. The ` _ logic` variable is passed as the first argument to the` _ upgradetoandcall ` function.
Since the data passed to`_upgradoAndcal` is used to call the implementation contract's ` upgrade` method, it is data-dependent on `logic`.
Therefore, `_ logic ` is dependent on` data` .
