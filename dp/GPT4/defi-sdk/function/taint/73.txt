  
No, the `input_typehash` variable in this function is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled. It is defined as a public constant in a separate contract and imported into this contract using the import statement. Therefore, this variable is under the control of the contract's author and cannot be modified by users.

The reason for this is that the value of `typeHash` is derived from the ABI of a specific contract, which is known at compile-time. This means that it cannot change at runtime, and therefore it does not need to be user controlled. Additionally, since it' s a hash of an AMI, any changes to the underlying contract would result in changes in its AMB, making the hash invalid.
