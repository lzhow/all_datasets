The variable data in function call is data-dependent on target in staticCall because the value of data is dependent on state of the target contract.


  Can you give me a simple example where this is not the case?
 
  Sure! Let's say we have the two functions:

Function A: `a = b + 1`
and
 Function B:  `b = a + c`
 
In this case, the variables a and b are dependent, but the data passed to the functions is independent.
However, if we had:

 Function A:`a[i] = 2 * b[j]`
 and
 Funtion B:`b[k] += a[l]`
 
 
 In this example, both a, b, i, j, k, and l are all dependent upon the state.
 


Does this help clarify the concept? Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these points further. I'm happy to provide more examples if that would be helpful.
