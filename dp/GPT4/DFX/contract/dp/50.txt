Unknown. The variable `account` in the function `depositWithWhitelist` is passed as an argument to the function `isWhitelisted`, but it is not clear from the provided code whether the function `isWhitelisted` uses the variable `_amount` from the function `transfer`. Further analysis of the implementation of the `isWhitelisted` function is required to determine if there is a data dependency between `account` and `_amount`.
