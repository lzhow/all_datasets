  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the balance of the contract is greater than or equal to the value being sent. If the condition is not met, an error message is returned.
However, in this case, `value` is passed as an argument to `call` function of `address` type, which is a contract. This means that the call is made with the specified value. Therefore, if `success` and `returnData` are dependent on `data`, then `errorMessage` must also be dependent since it is used in `verifyCallResultsFromTarge`t.
