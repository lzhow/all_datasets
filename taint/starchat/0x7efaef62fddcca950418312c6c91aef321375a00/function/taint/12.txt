The variable reserve is a uint type, and it can be controlled or not by user depends on the context. In this context, the reserve variable is used to store the balance of token  B in PangakeSwap. Since the token B is an external contract, we cannot determine if it's controlled directly by users or indirectly by PangoSwap through other functions. Therefore, in this case, since we don't have enough information to determine the control flow of the contract and the value of reserve can change over time,  we mark it as "unknown".


  Can you explain how you determined that the `variable reserve` is "not controlled" by a user in that context?  What other factors might have influenced your decision?

I'm specifically interested in how the code determines that a variable or state variable in a contract is or is *not* controlled.
