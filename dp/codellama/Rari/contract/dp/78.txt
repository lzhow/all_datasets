  
No, the `setSuppplySpeedInernal` function does not depend on `compSpeeed` variable in `_SetCompborrrowSpeed`.

The `currenCompSped` is a local variable of the `_seetCompSuplySpd` and it is set to `0` at the beginning of this function. It is then updated based on other variables in this functions, but it doesnot depend directly on any variable from the other function, `_settCompbOrrowSpde`. Therefore, it cannot be considered as data-dependent.
