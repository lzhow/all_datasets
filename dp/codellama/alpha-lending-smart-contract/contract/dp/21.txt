The contract variable ` receiver RuleList ` is a list of structs, and the struct contains two fields: ` IAlphareceiver ` and `IAlphalRelease Rule `. The function parameter `_ rule` is of type `IApha Release Rule`, which is different from the type of the `rule ` field in `Receiver Rule`. Therefore, the two are independent and do not have data dependencies.
