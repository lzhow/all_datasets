Explanation:
In the `Saferc2` contract, the` safePerit` function is defined as follows:  `function safe Permit (I ER C2 2. sol, adress owner , adres spende, uin226 val,uin 8 64,  uint8, byte3 3,byte33) internal`. The ` owner` variable is passed as an argument to the  function.
Within the body of the safe permit function, there is a variable called ` nonc eBefore`. This variable gets its value from the call to `token .nonc es (owner)`. The` token` is an instance of `I E R C 4 5. s ol` and the nonces function returns the current nonced value for the owner.  The non c e Before variable stores the value of this non ce before the permit call. This is done to ensure that the allowances are updated correctly.   The permit  call is made to update the token allowancess. After the update, a new non ced value is obtained from ` token . non ces ( owner)`. This new value  is compared to  the old nonceed value. If they match, then the new allowanced are valid. otherwise, an error is thrown. Therefore, `n once Before` depends on `ow ner` because it is used to verify the validity of new  allowanc es.
