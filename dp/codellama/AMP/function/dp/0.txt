  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `defaultParition`'s `transferredBy` state is updated by the `_operator` and the value of `_to` is added to the state.
`_value`, which is a parameter of the method, is used to update the transferredBy state of `defualtPartion`.
Therefore, `totalsupplybyPartiton` depends on `_Value`.
