The variable i in function  binary search is not dependent on variable cardinal in get surrounding observations. This is because the value of i is calculated using the expression ( l+r )/2, where l and r are both dependent variables. However, the cardinal variable is only used to calculate the length of the array, and it is never used in any calculations involving i. Therefore, i and cardinal are independent.
