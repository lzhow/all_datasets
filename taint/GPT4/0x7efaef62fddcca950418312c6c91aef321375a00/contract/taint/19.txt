Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `balance1` in the function `_update` is assigned the value of the balance of `token1` held by the contract address, which is obtained by calling `IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this))`. Since `token1` is an ERC20 token, its balance can be influenced by user actions. Users can send `token1` to the contract address or trigger functions that modify the contract's balance of `token1` (such as `swap`, `mint`, `burn`, etc.). Therefore, the value of `balance1` is indirectly controlled by user actions, and any transaction that alters the contract's balance of `token1` will affect `balance1`.
