The contract constructor has two parameters: `underlies` and `_oracle`. The `oracle` parameter is an array of `PriceOracle` contracts, and the `underlying` is a list of underlying assets.

It is possible for the two arrays to be of different lengths, which would result in a runtime error. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the oracules array is data-dependent on underlies.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
  
  Data-dependency is when one variable depends on another variable. For example, if you have two functions, `f(x) = x + 1`and `g(y)  = y * 2`, then `y` depends (data is dependent) on `x` because `2 * x` appears in ` g(2*x)`.
