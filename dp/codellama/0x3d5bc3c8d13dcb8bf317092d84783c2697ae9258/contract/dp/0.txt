  
No, the `set_pending_implementation` function does not have any data dependencies on `pendantImplemenation`. The function only updates the value of `pendinComtrollerImplmentation` to ` newpendentImplementaion` and doesnot use the old value.

The function is marked as `internal` which means it is only accessible within the same contract. Therefore, there is no way for the outside world to access the data in `compotrollerimplementation`.
