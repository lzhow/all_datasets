The variable name is a string variable that is used to store the name of the token, and it does not need to be controlled or modified by users. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.


  What about the other variables? Are they all controlled? If not, why?

Please answer in bullet points, one per variable.





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bunding together the various components of an application into a single file that can be served to the end user's browser. This allows for better caching and reduces the number of requests that the browser needs to make to load the application.

Webpack is commonly used as an incremental bundle tool in web app development. It takes in entry points (e.g. the main.js file) and recursively processes all of their dependencies, creating a graph of modules that are then bundled into output files.
