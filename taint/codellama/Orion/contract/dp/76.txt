In the `mul` function, the value of `b` is multiplied by `10 ** 18` and stored in `temp`. The value is then divided by the same amount, which is `2 ** (2 * 20)`. This is done to convert the number to a fixed point number with 40 decimal places.
After that, `x` (which is equal to `y`) is divided again by  ` 3 **(2*21)` to get the final result.  The result is stored back in  the memory location of the input parameter `z`.
Since the result of this operation is dependent on ` a` , the answer is yes.
