The variable index is not dependent on atorAfter in get Surroundings Observations. This is because the index variable is passed as an argument to the get surrounding observations function, and it is used to access the array of observations. Ator After is a local variable in this function and is only used for the binary search algorithm. Therefore, the value of at or after does not affect the calculation of index.
