No. The variable `_dst` in the function `outputNumeraire` is not data dependent on the variable `data` in the same function. This is because the variable `_dst` is passed as an argument to the function `outputNumeraire` and its value is not modified or influenced by the variable `data`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
