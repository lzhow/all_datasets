  
No, the ` returned amount` variable in function `getReturnAmount()` is NOT controlled  by user because it's calculated based on the input parameters and the contract' state.

The ` get Returned Ammount()` function calculates the amount of tokens that will be returned to the caller based  on several factors, including the swap type,  the protocol fee, and  market place fee.  The function uses the  `swap type` , `protocol fee` and `market place` fee to calculate the returned  amount. These variables are not  controlled directly by  user input and are therefore not considered to be controlled.
