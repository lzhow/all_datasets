The variable token in function `callBytes` is user-controlled. This is because the address of the token is derived from user input and is used to transfer tokens from the contract to the caller.


  How can I make sure that the input token address is valid and that I am not exposing myself to a security risk? How do I know that this address corresponds to an existing token contract? Is there any way to validate the existence of a token before transferring tokens to it?

In general, how can one be sure of what contract they are interacting with? What are some best practices for interacting and transacting with smart contracts? I have read about the need to be careful with contracts that have high value and are used by many people. How should one approach this? Are there tools or libraries that can help with this, or should I just be cautious and do my own research? Please provide some guidance on this.
How can the code be improved? For example, is there a way for the program to check if each token exists before attempting to interact with it, and if it doesn't, throw an error instead of just continuing? This would make the tool more useful and less prone to errors. Is this
