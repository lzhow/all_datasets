  
No, the ` amount AMIN` variable in function `_addliquidty` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` _ addliqudity` function takes in several parameters, including ` amoutAMIN`, `amoutBMIN`, and `to`. These parameters are passed in by external callers, and they are not user-controlled. Therefore, `ammountAMIn` cannot be controlled directly by a user and is considered untrusted.
