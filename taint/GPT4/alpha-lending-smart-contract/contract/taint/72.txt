Label: no

Reason: The variable `_decimals` in the ERC20 contract is declared as a private uint8 variable. This means it is not directly accessible from outside the contract; it can only be accessed and modified by functions within the contract itself. The only function that modifies `_decimals` is `_setupDecimals`, which is an internal function. Since internal functions can only be called from within the contract or from derived contracts, and there is no public or external function exposed to allow users to call `_setupDecimals`, the variable `_decimals` is not controlled by the user.
