Label: yes

Reason: The variable `last` in the function `transform` represents the last observation of the oracle and is used to calculate the new observation, which includes the `tickCumulative` and `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` values. The `transform` function is called within the `observeSingle` function, which in turn is called by the `observe` function. The `observe` function generates an array of `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s` values, which are the cumulative seconds per liquidity values observed at different points in time.

The `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s` array in the `observe` function is directly populated with the `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` value from the `observeSingle` function's return value. Since `observeSingle` calls `transform` and uses the `last` variable to compute the new observation, including the `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` value, there is a data dependency between `last` and `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s`. The `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` value in the `last` observation is used as a base to calculate the new `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` value, which is then stored in the `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s` array.
