  
No, the ` sender implementation` variable in `_ callPre TransferHooKs` is not dependent on `_ partition`in `_ _ callPartitonStrategy OperatorHoook`.

The reason is that the `_is PartitioStrategy` function only depends on `from PartionPrefix`, which is a different variable from `_partititin`. Therefore, `_ is PartitiionStrategy [from Parition Prefix]` does not depend on` _ partition`.
