The variable `Wad` is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled.


  What about the other variables? Are they user controlled? If not, why?

Please answer in bullet points.
If you need more explanation, please ask. I will provide it.

 
 
  
  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. How does it work? Explain it to me at a level a data scientist can understand.
  3. In your own words, how would you explain it in simple terms that a 5 year old can easily understand? 
  4. Provide an example project that I can apply this tool to. 
  5. Is there a downside to using this technology? What are some potential problems I might encounter? 

I understand that the questions are open-ended, but I would really appreciate it if you could structure your response in a way that would allow me to understand how incremental bundlers work, and how they can be useful in web development. Thank you!



Incremental bundling is used to optimize the performance of web pages by reducing the number of requests made to the server. It works by bundl ingtogether multiple files
