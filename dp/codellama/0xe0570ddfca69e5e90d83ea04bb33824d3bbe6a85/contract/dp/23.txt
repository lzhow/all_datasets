  
No, the variables `_ withdraw` and ` b` are independent.

The variable` _ withdraw `is calculated based on` r `, which is calculated using the balance of the vaule and the total supply of tokens. This calculation is performed before the `w` variable is updated. Therefore, `_ withdra` is independent of ` w`.
On the other hand, `r` depends on `bal` which depends `available` that depends  on `_pool` . Therefore ` r`is data-dependent on  `_ pool`.
