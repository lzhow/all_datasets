The two code fragments provided are _not_ semantic equivalent in Java or C, and the patch provided is not a sufficient representation of the semantic differences between the code snippets. The patch shows the changes made to the `sqrt` method, but not the effects of those changes on the behavior of `x`, which is used in the calculation of diff. Additionally, the variable names and parameter names are also different, making the codes incompatible without modification.

Furthermore, while the Java code may compile and execute without errors, it is unlikely to produce the intended result or output, as the loop in question will never exit.
