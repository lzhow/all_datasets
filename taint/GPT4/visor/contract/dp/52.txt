Reason: The variable `success` in the function `functionStaticCall` is determined by the outcome of the `staticcall` to the `target` address with the provided `data`. It is a boolean value that indicates whether the call was successful or not. On the other hand, the variable `errorMessage` in the function `_verifyCallResult` is a parameter that represents a message to revert with in case the call was not successful and there is no return data to provide a more specific error. The `success` variable does not depend on the content of `errorMessage`; it solely depends on the result of the `staticcall`. The `errorMessage` is used only if `success` is `false` and there is no return data, but it does not influence the value of `success`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `success` in `functionStaticCall` and `errorMessage` in `_verifyCallResult`.
