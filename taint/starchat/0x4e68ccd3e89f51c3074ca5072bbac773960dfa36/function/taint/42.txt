The variable success is a boolean value that is set to true if a transfer was successful and false if it failed. It is used to check if an external call to the token contract was successfully executed. However, the value of success can be influenced by external factors, such as the state of the blockchain or the availability of gas. Therefore, we cannot determine with certainty whether or not success will be controlled directly by a user input.


  What is an example of a situation where the success variable would be user controlled?  How would you mitigate this?
