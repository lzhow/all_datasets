Yes

The variable `returndata` in the function `getProxyAdmin` is data dependent on the variable `proxy` because `returndata` is assigned the result of a `staticcall` made to the address contained in the `proxy` variable. The `staticcall` is used to execute a read-only function on the contract at the address specified by `proxy`, and the data returned by this call is stored in `returndata`. Therefore, the value of `returndata` directly depends on the contract at the address `proxy` and the specific function called (in this case, identified by the bytes `hex"f851a440"`). If the address in `proxy` were different, the data in `returndata` could be different as well, hence there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
