  
No, the `AbsoulteTokenAmoutTypeHash` contract is not dependent on `Input` variable in `Execute` function.

The `getAbsolutetokenAmount` method is called in this function, which is responsible for calculating the absolute amount of the input token. This method takes the token amount and the account as input and returns the calculated absolute token balance. However, this method does not depend on any variable from the execute function and can be called independently. Therefore, it is safe to say that the state is independent of ` Input` and doesnot depend.
