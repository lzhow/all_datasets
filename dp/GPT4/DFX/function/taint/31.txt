The variable `tAmt_` in the function viewOriginSwap is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `tAmt_` is calculated based on the input parameters `_origin`, `_target`, and `_originAmount`, which are provided by the user. However, the calculation of `tAmt_` is performed internally within the function using the `getOriginAndTarget` function and other internal calculations. The user does not have direct control over the value assigned to `tAmt_`. Therefore, the variable `tAmt_` is not controlled by the user.
