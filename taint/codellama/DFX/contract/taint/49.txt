  
The variable _ name in function  new curve is unknown.

This is because the _  name variable is passed as an argument to the new  Curves function, which is called by only the owner of the contract. Therefore, the value of _ _ is determined by whoever calls the  New Curv function. However, since the only person who can call this function is only owner, we can conclude that the name is under the control of only one user, and therefore the answer is yes.
