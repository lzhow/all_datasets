Reason: The variable `senderImplementation` in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` is assigned a value based on the `_from` parameter, which represents the address of the sender in a token transfer operation. It is used to retrieve the address of a contract that implements the `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER` interface for the sender's address. This is done through the `interfaceAddr` function call, which is independent of the `_partition` variable.

On the other hand, the variable `_partition` in the function `_callPartitionStrategyOperatorHook` is used to determine the partition strategy and to check if an operator is authorized for a specific partition scope. The logic within `_callPartitionStrategyOperatorHook` is related to partition strategies and operator permissions, which are separate concerns from the sender implementation logic in `_callPreTransferHooks`.

Since the value of `senderImplementation` is determined solely by the sender's address and the `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER` interface, and `_partition` in `_callPartitionStrategyOperatorHook` is used for a different purpose, there is no direct data dependency between `senderImplementation` and `_partition`. They operate on different aspects of the contract's state and logic.
