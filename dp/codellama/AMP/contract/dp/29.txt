  
No, the variables ` amount` and `_ from` are independent.

The variable amount is assigned a value from the `allowances` mapping, which is not dependent on `_to` or `_value`.
On the other hand, `_balancesto` is updated in `_transerBydefaultpartition` function, but it is also not directly dependent  on ` _ from`.
