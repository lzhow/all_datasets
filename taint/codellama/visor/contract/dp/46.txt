In the constructor function, the `visor` contract is created with the `_visir` address as an argument. This means that the address of the deployed `visor` smart contract will be stored in `this.visor`.
Then, in line 10 of your code, `address public _visor;` is declared.
This means the value of `_visor`, which is an address, is stored as a public variable in your contract.  This is a dependency between the two.
