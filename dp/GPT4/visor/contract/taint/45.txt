Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` is an input parameter to the function. Since this function is marked as `internal`, it can only be called from within the contract itself or from derived contracts, not directly by an external user. However, the contract could expose a public or external function that calls `functionStaticCall`, and this public function could accept an address as an argument from the user. In such a case, the user would be able to control the value of `target` by passing the address they choose as an argument to the public function, which then passes it to `functionStaticCall`. Therefore, without additional context on how `functionStaticCall` is used within the contract, we assume that it is possible for `target` to be user-controlled.
