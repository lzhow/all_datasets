Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `amp` in the function `get_y` is not directly used or referenced in the function `getAmountOutUniversal`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `amp` and `factory`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if `amp` is used in some other part of the code that is not shown in the given example. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship between `amp` and `factory`.
