  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `getLpToken` function, the amount of liquid tokens (LP tokens) is calculated based on `reserves` and `totalSupply`. The `LPToken.balances` mapping is used to store the balance of each token in each LP token.
Since the calculation of `bal` is based only on reserves and totalSuppy, it is data-dependent on these variables. Therefore, `lpTokenBal` depends on both `tokens` (which is a mapping of token addresses to their balances) and the LP tokens themselves.
