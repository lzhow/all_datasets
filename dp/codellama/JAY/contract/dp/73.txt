  
No, the `buyerJays` variable is not dependent on `prices` because the two functions are unrelated.

The `Buyer` function is a public function that allows users to buy Jays with Ether. It takes in several parameters, including `ERc 7 51 token addresses`, `Erc-75  ids`, and `Etherc -1  amounts`. The function then calls the internal ` buy ERc` and` buy Erc ` functions to transfer the NFT tokens to the user's wallet.  The ` update Fees`function is an internal function used to update the fees for buying and selling Jay tokens. This function takes no parameters and updates the values of the` sell Nft Fee Eth`,` Buy Ntf FEE ETh`,and`BuynftfeeJaY` variables based on current market conditions. These variables are used in other functions, such as the buy and sell functions. However, these variables do not affect the behavior ofthe ` Buyer ` function. Therefore, ` erC 8 9  Amounts ` is independent of ` prices ` in ` Update Fe es`.
