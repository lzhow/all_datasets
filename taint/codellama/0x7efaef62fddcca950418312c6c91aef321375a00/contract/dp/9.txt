  
No, the `sucess` variable in `_safeTranfer` is not dependent on `_totalsupply`.

The `safeTrasnfer()` function is called in ` mint()` to transfer tokens from the contract to the recipient. It takes three arguments: `token`, `to`, and `value`. The `balances` of the tokens are updated in this function.
However, ` _totasuppy`is not used in` safeTranser()` and is therefore not a dependency.
