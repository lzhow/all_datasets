Reason: The variable `vars` in the function `borrowFresh` is a local variable that is declared and used within the scope of the `borrowFresh` function. It is used to store intermediate calculations related to the borrowing process, such as `accountBorrows`, `accountBorrowsNew`, and `totalBorrowsNew`.

On the other hand, the variable `seizeTokens` is a parameter of the function `seize`, which is a separate function that deals with the seizing of tokens in the context of liquidation. The `seizeTokens` variable is used as an argument to the `seizeInternal` function call within the `seize` function.

Since `vars` is local to `borrowFresh` and `seizeTokens` is local to `seize`, and there is no interaction or shared state between these two functions indicated in the provided code snippet, there is no data dependency relationship between `vars` and `seizeTokens`. Data dependency would require that the value of one variable influences or is influenced by the value of the other, which is not the case here.
