Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `transferFrom` and the variable `subtractedValue` in the function `decreaseAllowance` are function parameters that are independent of each other. Each function call receives its own arguments, and there is no code in the provided snippet that establishes a data dependency between these two variables. They are used separately within their respective functions to perform different operations: `amount` is used to transfer tokens and to decrease the allowance in `_approve`, while `subtractedValue` is used to decrease the allowance in a different context within `_approve`. There is no shared state or computation that would create a data dependency between `amount` and `subtractedValue`.
