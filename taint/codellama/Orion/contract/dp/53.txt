  
No, the variables ` to` and ` reserve` are independent.

The variable to is assigned a value based on whether the current factory type is CURVE or not. It is not dependent on any other variable.  The variable reserve is a local variable in function  `_ swap` that is used to calculate the amount of tokens to be transferred. However, it is only used in a calculation and is never used as an input to any function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
