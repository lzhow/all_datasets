  
No, the data of the state `_EC5_Transer_Failure` is not dependent on variable`_to`.

The state is defined in a different function, `_transerByDefualtPartion`, and it is used to indicate that the transfer failed. It is a separate state that is independent of `_from` and `_value`. Therefore, it does not depend on `_ to`.
