The variable `nGLiq_` in the function `getTargetSwapData` is assigned a value based on the variable `curve.assets` in the for loop. However, without knowing the implementation of the `curve.assets` and how it is modified in other parts of the code, we cannot determine if there is a data dependency between `nGLiq_` and `curve` in this specific function.
