In the `getOriginSWapdata` function, the `_oBal` variable is assigned the value of `Assililatros.ViewNumaraireBallance` of the assimilater at index `_inputIX`. This function is called in `ViewOriginSwaoData` and `Origin Swao` functions.
`_oGliq`, `_NGLliQ`, and `_NBals` are also assigned values in these functions, which are used to calculate the amount of tokens that can be traded.  `_Ammt` is also calculated in this function. Therefore, `_AMMT` depends on `_NGLIQ`.
