The variable amount out in get amounts in is user controlled.


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because the contract is written by a human? Or is it just because it's a mathematical formula? If it was a formula, could you please explain it to me? I'm not very good at math.
If it wasn't a math formula could it be because of the way the code was written? Could you maybe rewrite the formula so it would be easier for me to understand? 

Please explain your reasoning. I want to know why you think it should be user controllable. Is it a security concern? Is there a specific reason why it has to be that way? Please explain to my why this is important. 
 I would also like to see how you would implement this in a real life example, if you could provide that as well. It would help me a lot to better understand how this works.  Thank you.


I'm asking you this because I think this would greatly help my understanding of how to use the tool you made. If you can explain this to a layman like me, that would make it much easier to grasp how the program works and how I can use it. Thank
