The variable market is a mapping in Solidty. It is used to store information about each market. In the case of the CompTroller contract, the markes variable is an internal mapping that stores information on each of its supported marktes.

In the context of smart contracts, mappings are typically used when you want to associate a value with a specific key. For example, you can use a mappin to keep track of all the accounts that have a certain balance. When you access the balance of an account, using the key,you can retrieve the associated value. 

However, in this case, we are not interested in keeping track the value of each key in a market mapping. Instead, what we want is to know if a particular market is supported by CompTrller or not. This is why the mapping is defined as a bool. If the market exists in markt, then it has a key of true, and if it does not exist, its key is false.
