Label: no

Reason: The variable `index` in the function `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions` is used to manage the array of partitions (`_totalPartitions`) and their corresponding indices (`_indexOfTotalPartitions`). It is assigned a value based on the position of a partition within the `_totalPartitions` array and is used to remove a partition from that array.

On the other hand, the variable `_operator` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` represents the address of the operator involved in a transfer operation. This variable is used to check and execute hooks related to the transfer of tokens between partitions.

There is no direct assignment, computation, or logical connection between `index` and `_operator` within the scope of their functions or across the contract that would indicate a data dependency relationship. The `index` is solely dependent on the partition-related data structures, while `_operator` is related to the transfer operation context. They operate independently within their respective functions and do not influence each other's values.
