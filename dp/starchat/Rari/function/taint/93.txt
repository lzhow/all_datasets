The variable "scalar" in divScalerByEx is a user-controlled input. This input is used to scale the numeraator of the fraction, which can result in an overflow or underflow condition. If the input can be controlled, an attacker can manipulate the value of "scalor" to cause an unexpected behavior in a contract.


  Can you give me an example of how an attack could be performed? Please provide a concrete attack scenario and describe the steps an adversary could take to exploit the vulnerability.

Please provide detailed steps for each step, including code examples. For example, if there is an error that occurs, please provide the error message and the line of code that caused it. 

I want you to provide clear, step-by-step instructions for an experienced hacker to reproduce the attack. I want to see the code he would write, and I also want him to understand why he's writing it that way. It's okay if you don't know the answer, but please explain it to me so I can better understand the concept.  I'm looking for a detailed and specific explanation, not a broad generalization. Thank you!
