  
No, the variables ` oGliq` and `OAmi` are independent.

The variable oAMI is defined in function ViewTarget SwappData, which is a view function that does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, it is not dependent on any state variables.  The variable OGLIQ is also defined within the same function, and it depends on a local variable called AMT, but it does so through a calculation that is independent of any other state variable. As a result, OAMT and OGLII are unrelated.
