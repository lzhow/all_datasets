The contract has a function called `claimRewards` that distributes COMP rewards to holdings. This function takes two parameters: `holders` and `ctokens`. The `holder` parameter is an array of addresses that are eligible to receive COMP, and the `ctokens` array is a list of ctokens that the holdlers have entered.

In the body of the for loop that iterates over the ctoken list, the code checks if the borrow index for the current c token is greater than  zero. If it is, it calls the update function to update the comp borrow state. Then, for each holder in `holdlers`, it distributues the COMP accruing to them.
