Reason: The contract state `canAdminOverwrite` is a boolean variable that determines whether the admin is allowed to overwrite existing assignments of oracles to underlying tokens. It is used in the `add` function to check if the admin can overwrite the oracle for a given underlying token.

On the other hand, the variable `underlying` in the function `price` is a local variable that represents the address of an underlying token for which the price is being fetched. The `price` function uses this variable to check if the underlying token is a special case (e.g., WETH) and to fetch the price from the corresponding oracle if it is not.

There is no direct data dependency between `canAdminOverwrite` and `underlying` in the function `price`. The `canAdminOverwrite` state does not influence the logic or the outcome of the `price` function, and the `underlying` variable does not read from or write to the `canAdminOverwrite` state. They operate independently within the contract, and their interactions are with different aspects of the contract's functionality.
