Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `tokenA` in the function `pairFor` is not used or referenced in the function `get_y`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `tokenA` and `_i`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency between them if the value of `tokenA` is somehow used or modified in the contract state or other functions that are called within `get_y`. Without further information about the contract's overall logic and dependencies, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between `tokenA` and `_i`. Hence, the label is unknown.
