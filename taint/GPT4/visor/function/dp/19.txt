yes

The variable `c` in the function `add` is data dependent on the variable `b` because `c` is assigned the result of the addition of `a` and `b`. The value of `c` directly depends on the value of `b` (as well as `a`), as it is used in the arithmetic operation that computes `c`. Therefore, any change in the value of `b` will affect the value of `c`.
