Label: No

Reason: The variable `partitionManagerImplementation` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` is assigned a value based on the result of the `interfaceAddr` function call, which takes `address(this)` and the result of `PartitionUtils._getPartitionStrategyValidatorIName(toPartitionPrefix)` as arguments. The `toPartitionPrefix` is derived from the `_toPartition` parameter of the `_callPostTransferHooks` function.

On the other hand, the variable `_partition` in the function `_isOperatorForPartition` is a parameter of that function and is used to check operator status for a specific partition.

There is no direct data flow or computational dependency between `_partition` in `_isOperatorForPartition` and `partitionManagerImplementation` in `_callPostTransferHooks`. They are used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
