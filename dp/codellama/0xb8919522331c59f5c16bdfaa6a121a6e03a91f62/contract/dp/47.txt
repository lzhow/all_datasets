The contract variable `_ROLE_ADDR` is a storage slot that stores the address of the current implementation contract. It is used to store the implementation address in a persistent manner.  The variable is initialized with the value of `0` and is updated when the `_upgrateTo` function  is called. Therefore, the data in `_ IMPLMENTAION_ SLOT ` is dependent on ` new Implementation `, but the reverse is false.
