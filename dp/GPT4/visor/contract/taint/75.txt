Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `element` in the function `findUpperBound` is a parameter to the function. Whether it is controlled by the user or not depends on how the `findUpperBound` function is called within the contract. If the function is called from a public or external function that takes user input, then `element` could be controlled by the user. However, if the function is only called internally by other functions within the contract and the value passed to `element` is not influenced by user input, then it is not controlled by the user. Since the provided code snippet does not include the context in which `findUpperBound` is called, we cannot determine with certainty whether `element` is user-controlled or not, hence the label is 'unknown'.
