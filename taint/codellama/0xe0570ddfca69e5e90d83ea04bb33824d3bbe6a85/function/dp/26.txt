In the `withraw` function, the value of `r` is calculated based on `balnce()` and `totalSuply()`. The value `msg` and `_sharess` are also used in this calculation. However, there is no direct relationship between ` msg` or `_share` with the `_implemenation` variable in ` proposeStra`. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether ` b` depends on `_ implementation` without further analysis.
