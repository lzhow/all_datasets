Label: no

Reason: The contract state `priceOracle` is not present in the provided Solidity code snippet. Since `priceOracle` is not mentioned or used within the `mintAlToken` function or anywhere else in the provided code, there is no data dependency relationship between `priceOracle` and the variable `_amount` in the `mintAlToken` function. Data dependency would require that the value of one is calculated based on or influenced by the other, which is not the case here.
