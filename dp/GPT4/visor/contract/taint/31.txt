Label: yes

Reason: The variable `newOwner` in the function `transferTokenOwnership` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called. Since this function can only be called by the current owner of the contract (as enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier), and the value of `newOwner` is specified by the caller, it is controlled by the user who has the ability to call this function (the current owner). Therefore, the `newOwner` variable is indeed controlled by the user.
