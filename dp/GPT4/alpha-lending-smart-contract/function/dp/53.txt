Reason: The variable `_token` in the function `calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmount` is used to access the `pool` from the `pools` mapping, which is a state variable. The variable `_amount` in the function `updateBorrowAlphaReward` is used to update the `_pool.totalAlphaTokenReward` and potentially the `_pool.alphaMultiplier` if `_pool.totalBorrowShares` is not zero. There is no direct relationship between `_token` and `_amount` as they are used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions. `_token` is used to identify which pool to operate on, while `_amount` is used to update the reward amount within a given pool. There is no code indicating that the value of `_token` is influenced by or influences the value of `_amount`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
