The two provided codes, while syntactically not equal, are also semanticall equal: as humans we are able to easily discern and identify the differences that the semantic patch represents, and in this case the fix is quite straightforward.

There are only two places in which the mutated code differs from the original in terms of its behaviour:
1. In the calculation of `bonus` when `i>1k and i<= 2k`, the corrected formula becomes: 
```
bonus = bonus - 1 * 7.5%
(previous)   bonus = 850 + 457 * (i - k) / (k * N)
 (corrected)  =          462.4 -        76.2 *        i /           1K  ->  (bonus) =           426
 ```
 
2: In `abs` method, the correction replaces `-` with `--`, which effectively negates the value of a number. Here is the code
java
    ```
   public double abs (double A){
   if (A < =0){
    return = --A;
   }
   return A;
    }
}
     ```
