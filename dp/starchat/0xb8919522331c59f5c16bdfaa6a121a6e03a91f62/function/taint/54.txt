The variable _ADMIN\_SLOT in this function is unknown because it does not follow the naming convention for variables that are "internal" to a contract. Additionally, the code does appear to be a proxy contract, which is a type of contract that is used to upgrade other contracts. However, this code snippet does contain some important information about the implementation of the proxy pattern.

In the OpenZeppelin library, there is an implementation called "TransparentUpgradableProxies" that inherits from the "UpgradeabbleProxy" contract in OpenZepplin. This contract has an internal slot called \_ADMINSLOT that stores the address of an administrator for the contract (the address that can upgrade the logic contract).
\
When the constructor is called, a new proxy is created and the \_adminSlot variable is initialized to the admin parameter. Since the parameter is payabel, and this contract inherits the payablity from TransperantUpgraderProxy, then the new contract will also be payble.


  Can you explain what the internal slots are? I've heard that they're a way to store data in a Solidty contract without using the storage variable. Can't you access the data from outside the smart contract? If so,
