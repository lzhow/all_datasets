  
No, the `contract state balanceof` is not dependent on `_variable1`.

The reason is that the value of `reserves` and `total supply` are calculated and stored in local variables `_ reserve0`and `_total Supply` before the calculation of the amount of liquidities to be burned.
Therefore, changes to `_ reserves1 `after the local variable is calculated will not affect the result of calculating the liquid amount.
