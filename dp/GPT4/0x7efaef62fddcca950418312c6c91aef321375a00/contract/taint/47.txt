Reason: The variable `symbol` in the contract `PancakeERC20` is declared as a public constant string with the value 'Cake-LP'. This means that its value is set at compile time and cannot be changed thereafter. Since it is a constant, it is not controlled by the user and remains the same for the lifetime of the contract. Here is the relevant line of code:

```solidity
string public constant symbol = 'Cake-LP';
```

This line defines `symbol` as a constant, which means its value is fixed and not subject to change by any user or function within the contract or externally.
