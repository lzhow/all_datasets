Label: no

Reason: The variable `i` in the constructor is a loop counter used to iterate over the arrays `underlyings` and `_oracles`. It is not directly controlled by the user; instead, it is initialized and incremented by the contract code itself during the execution of the loop. The values of `underlyings` and `_oracles` provided to the constructor can be controlled by the user who deploys the contract, but the loop counter `i` is an internal mechanism of the contract's logic to process those inputs.
