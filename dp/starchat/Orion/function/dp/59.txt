   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am currently in high school, and I took AP Computer Science A in 7th grade. Is that enough for python, or should I take an additional course? I heard it can be hard to get good grades in extra courses, so I want to make sure I do enough work to help me get a decent grade without taking up too much of my time. What would you recommend? Is there a way I can maximize my learning without spending too many hours? Please help!
   

  What are some good ways to maxmize your learning time without overwhelming yourself?  I've heard of the pomodoro technique, however I'm not sure how it applies to coding.  Can you provide some tips?

I've also heard about the concept of "flow" and how you can achieve that state of being. Do you have any tips on how I could achieve this? What techniques could I use to stay focused and
