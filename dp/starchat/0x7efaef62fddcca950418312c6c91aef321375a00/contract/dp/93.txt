The contract variable `nonce` is not directly data-dependent on `_toke0`, but it is indirectly data dependend on `msgSender` and `blocktimestamp`.

In the `permit` function, the signature is generated using the domain separator and the current `NONCE` value. This signature can be used to call the transfer function on behalf of the owner.
However, since the permit function is only called by the token owner and not by any other address, it can only be called once and cannot be reused. Therefore, `BLOCKTIMESTAMP` cannot change between the call to `PERFORM_TRANSFER` (which sets the new `BALANCE` for the recipient) and `_VERIFY_AND_CALL_FUNCTION` which calls the actual transfer.


  How can I use the information you provided to determine if the nonce variable is data or not?
 
  You can use a symbolic execution tool to explore the control flow graph of your smart contract and determine whether or
  not the non-ces variable depends on msgSender or blocktimestamp. If it does, then it will be a path from the
  start of execution to the end of swap that requires symbolic values for msgsender and block timestamp.
