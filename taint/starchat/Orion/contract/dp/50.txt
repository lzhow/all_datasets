1. Choose a development environment: You can write Python code on any text editor or IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text. However, if you want to run Python scripts from the command line or integrate it with other applications, you'll need to install a Python interpreter. Popular Python interpreters include CPython, which is written in C, and PyPy, a faster implementation written entirely in Python.

For example, Python uses zero-based indexing, while most other languages start counting at Â½. Also, be careful not to mix spaces and tabs when writing code. To get familiarized with these differences, it's recommended
