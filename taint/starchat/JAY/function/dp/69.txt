The variable 'ids' in function 'buyERC20' is not dependent on 'amount' because it is an input to the'safeTranferFrom' function in 'IERC 771' which is a non-mutating function.

However, the variables 'tokenAddresses' & 'id' are dependent because they're used to access the array elements in '_tokenAddres' &'ids'.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "dependent" in this context. Could you please rephrase your question?
  
  Sorry for the confusion. I meant to say that the input variable "ids" is dependent upon the output variable of the same name in buyErc165.
