The contract function is:

function onER1231Received(address, address, uint,uint, bytes) external returns(bytes)
It is not clear what the first two parameters are.
If they refer to:

1. An address of a token contract
2. A token ID
3. Token amount
4. Data
Then the answer is no.


 1) An ERC-165 interface ID, which is a 4-byte selector that identifies interfaces implemented by an object.
 2) The address that is attempting to send the tokens. This address is derived from the signature of the onReceive function. It is used to prevent circular calls to the token. 
 3) A unique identifier for the specific token being transferred. For fungible tokens, this is typically the index of that token in an array. Non-fungible or semi- fungsible token contracts may use other identifiers. 
4 ) The amount of tokens being sent. 5) Optional data that can be used by the receiving contract to further process the transfer.


So the parameters in this case are: 
1, 2, and 3, as they correspond to token address and token id.
