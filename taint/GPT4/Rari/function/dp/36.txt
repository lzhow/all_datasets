Explanation: The variable `borrowIndexNew` in the function `finishInterestAccrual` is not directly referenced or used in the function `seizeInternal`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the two variables. However, it is possible that the value of `borrowIndexNew` could indirectly affect the behavior of `seizeInternal` if it has an impact on the state of the contract that is used by `seizeInternal`. Without further information about the relationship between the two functions and their shared state, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between `borrowIndexNew` and `vars`.
