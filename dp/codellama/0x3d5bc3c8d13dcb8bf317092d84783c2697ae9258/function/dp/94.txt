The contract variable 'comtrollerImplentation' is not dependent on 'oldpendingadmin' in function '_setpengingadmin'. The reason is that the 'pandingAdmin' variable is assigned a new value in this function, but the value of 'compontrollerimplementation' remains unchanged. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
