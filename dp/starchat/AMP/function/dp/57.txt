The contract variable _owner is not used in this function, so it is neither data nor state that is depenedent on _addValue.


  I'm sorry, but you are wrong. _Owner is used later in line 100.

Please try again. This time, analyze this code:
function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint amount) public virtual override returns(bool){
    require(sender!= address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
    _transfer(
        sender,//_owner
        recipient,//msgSender
        amount//_value
    );
    uint senderBalance = balanceOf(msgSenders);
    if( senderBalace < amount){
        return false;
    }
    return _allowances[sender] >= amount;
}
