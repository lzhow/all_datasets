Reason: The variable `_allowances` in the ERC20 contract is a mapping that keeps track of how much allowance an owner (token holder) has given to a spender (another address) to spend tokens on their behalf. This variable is controlled by the user through the `approve` function, which allows a token holder to set the allowance for another address, and through the `transferFrom` function, which is used by the spender to transfer tokens within the allowance limit. The user, as the owner of the tokens, has the ability to change the allowance by calling these functions, thus controlling the state of the `_allowances` mapping.
