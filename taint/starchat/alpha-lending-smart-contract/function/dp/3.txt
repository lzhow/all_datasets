The function claimAlphaRewards has a loop that iterates over all the users in a given pool and calculates the alpha rewards for each user. Inside the loop, the calculateAlpharward function is called, which calculates how much alpha tokens a user should receive based on their share of the pool's liquidity.

However, it's not clear from the code how the value of _amoun is used to calculate the reward. It's possible that the _amout variable is not used at all, and the calculation is simply based off of how many tokens the user has contributed to the given liqudity pool, regardless of their balance in alpha.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that I want you to explain why the `_token` variable in `calculateRoundupLiquidiyShareAmout` is data-dependent on `pool.alphatoken.TotalSupply()` in this case. Can you please explain this?
