Explanation: The variable `_inputIx` in the function `getOriginSwapData` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, but its value is determined by the contract or the calling function. Without further context, it is not possible to determine if the value of `_inputIx` is controlled by the user or not.
