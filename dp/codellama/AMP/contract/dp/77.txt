  
No, the variables `_tokeHolder ` and `_` are independent in this code.

The variable ` _tokHolder  ` is defined in function  `_partionsOf` and is used to store the balance of a particular address.  The variable  `` is also defined  within the same function and used for the granulatiry of the token. However, these two variable are used in different contexts and are therefore independent.
