Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `target` in the function `functionCall` is passed as an argument to the function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. Without further context or information about how the `target` variable is assigned, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label is unknown.
