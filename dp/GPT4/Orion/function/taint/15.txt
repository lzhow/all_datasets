Explanation: The variable `amounts` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is not directly controlled by the user. It is assigned a value based on the logic of the function, which includes calculations and interactions with other contracts. However, without further context or information about the values passed to the function, it is not possible to determine if the user has control over the final value of `amounts`.
