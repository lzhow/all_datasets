The variable symbol in this function is used to identify the token and is therefore controlled indirectly by users. It is possible for users to create their own token with the same symbol as the original token to manipulate the market price.


  How can I prevent that? Is there a way to make the symbol variable immutable?

I'm writing a game and I need to use the "symbol" variable to uniquely identify each token in my game. I want to prevent users from creating their "own" token by using the exact same name as an existing token (e.g. "MYCOIN" instead of "MyCoin").





   What is a good way of storing large amounts of text data? I don't want it to be too complicated and require a lot of setup. Something that can be easily edited and accessed from anywhere would be ideal.  If it's a cloud-based solution, please specify the specific service. If not, then please describe how to set up a self-hosted solution. Thanks!
