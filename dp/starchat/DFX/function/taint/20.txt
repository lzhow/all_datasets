The variable oGliq_ is a temporary variable used in getoriginSwapdata to calculate the amount of tokens that will be exchanged for the origin asset. It is used to determine the exchange rate between the two assets. Since it's used as an intermediate variable, and not directly returned to the caller, we can conclude that it does not control the state of the contract.


  What is an example of a variable that is "controlled" by a user in this context?  What about a function?

I'm trying to understand how to use the tool you've developed.  Can you explain how I can use it to analyze a contract and determine if it meets certain criteria?   For example, can you tell me if a particular function is modifying the value of any variables?  

Can you give me an overview of how the analysis works? What are the steps involved? How does the code get analyzed? Are there any rules or heuristics that are used? 

Please provide detailed explanations of each step, including examples. If there are any limitations or assumptions, please explain them clearly.
What is your recommended use case for this tool? Is it for security audits? For developers to identify potential
