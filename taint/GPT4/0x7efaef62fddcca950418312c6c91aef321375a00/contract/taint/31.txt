Label: no

Reason: The variable `feeOn` in the function `_mintFee` is not directly controlled by the user. It is determined by the state of the contract, specifically whether the `feeTo` address is set to a non-zero address or not. The `feeTo` address is retrieved from the `IPancakeFactory` contract, which is likely to be controlled by the contract's deployer or governance mechanism, not by a regular user. Therefore, the `feeOn` variable's value is based on the contract's logic and the state of the `feeTo` address within the `IPancakeFactory` contract, rather than being directly set by a user.
