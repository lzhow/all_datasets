  
The variable 'a' in mulSclaerTruncatAddInt function is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the 'mulScaler' function takes the input 'Exp' type variable as an argument, which is a user-defined type. Therefore, the value of 'm' is determined by user input.

In the mulScaleTrunctate function, 'addUint' takes two arguments, one of which comes from the result of the previous function call, and the other is an integer. However, since the first argument is of type 'uint', it cannot be controlled directly by a malicious user, but it can be influenced by an attacker who controls the second argument.
