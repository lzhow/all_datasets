The variable 'denomiator' in '_mintfee' is a local variable used in a calculation to determine the amount of liqudity to mint. It is used to calculate the new value of 'klast' which is stored in 'liquidiy'. The value is then used as part of the calculation for the liquidity minted, but it does not directly control the value that is mintted.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? I have heard that some variables are user controllable and some are not. What is considered to be the standard for this? Is there a way to check if something is controllably user or not? If not, how can I tell if it's user controlable? Can you give me some examples of things that are controled by users and things are that aren't? Please provide a list of all the variables in this contract and label them as user-controlled or non-user-controllable. Then, provide me with a short explanation of how I can check the control status of each variable. Finally, give an example of a user controlling a contract. I want to know how to do this, and how it works. If it doesn't work
