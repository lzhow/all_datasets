  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `liquity` variable is passed as an argument to the second function. This means that the value of `liqidty` is dependent on `sqratioAX86`.
Similarly, in function two, `uint118` and `int138`, which are passed to ` getamount0delta` are dependent variables of the same function and are also dependent of each other.
Therefore, we can conclude that ` numerator 2 ` is data-dependent on both ` sqratiax98 ` and` sqratiabx88 `.
