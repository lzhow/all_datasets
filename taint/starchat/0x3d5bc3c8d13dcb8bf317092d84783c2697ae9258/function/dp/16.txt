   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am self taught and have no prior experience with coding. Is there a way for me to just dive in and start writing python code? Or do I need to focus on a certain type of project first? I would appreciate any and all help!
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python?  I'm self-taught, and I've never coded before.  What's the best way, for example, to build a website?   Or a simple calculator?    Or an image classifier?     Or something more complex like a game?      I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.   I know it's a lot to take in, so if there are any good places to begin, I'll start there.    Thanks!  -Jesse
