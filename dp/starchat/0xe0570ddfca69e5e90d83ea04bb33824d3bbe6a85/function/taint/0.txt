yes, the `_stragegy` variable is a user controlled variable. It is set to an address of a contract that implements the Istrategy interface.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding how it all works together. I understand that the contract is trying to maximize profits by choosing the best strategy for the given market conditions. But I don't understand how all the different parts of the strategy contract work together to achieve that goal. For example, how does the want token work? How does it get deposited into the vault? And how is it withdrawn from it? Can I use a different strategy instead of this one? If so, what are the pros and cons of each one, and how do I choose which one is best for my needs? Please explain it in a way that is easy to understand, but still detailed enough to allow me to make an informed decision. Thank you.

Also, please provide me with a list of all of your strategies, along with their pro and con list. And please include a short explanation of how each strategy works. This will help me make the right choice for me. 

Thank you for your help. Your work is very impress
