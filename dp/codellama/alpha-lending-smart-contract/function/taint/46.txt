  
The variable _`rate_slo1 ` in function `constructor` is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the constructor function is called by a user when deploying the contract, and the `_base_borrow_rate`, `_ rate_Slop1`, and `_coll_percent` parameters are passed as arguments to the `Dai_Pool_Configuration` constructor. Therefore, the values of these variables are determined by users when they deploy the smart contract.
