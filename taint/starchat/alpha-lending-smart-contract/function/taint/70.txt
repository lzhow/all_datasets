  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it's important to know how it works so I can debug it if necessary. Can I ask you to explain it in a simpler way? Maybe with a flowchart? Please provide detailed explanations of each step. If you need help with the flowcharts, I'd be happy to provide you with some. Just let me know. Thank you.

I'm also having a hard time understanding how to use the tool. Could you please provide me with an example of how I could use it? For example, if I have a contract that uses OpenZeppelin's Safe Math library, how could I use your tool to check if any of my variables are controlled? How would I know which variables to look for? Could I just look at all the variables in my contract? What if my variable is an
