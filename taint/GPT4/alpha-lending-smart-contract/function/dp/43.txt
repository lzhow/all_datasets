Reason: The variable `totalLiquidity` in the function `getPool` is data dependent on the variable `_token` in the function `withdraw` because `totalLiquidity` is calculated by calling the function `getTotalLiquidity(_token)`, which takes `_token` as an argument. This indicates that the value of `totalLiquidity` is derived from the state of the `_token` passed to the function. Since the `withdraw` function also operates on the same `_token` (as it is a parameter of the function), any state changes to the `_token` caused by operations within the `withdraw` function, such as transferring tokens or burning shares, will affect the state that `getTotalLiquidity(_token)` reads to compute `totalLiquidity`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `totalLiquidity` and `_token` across these two functions.
