  
No, the variables ` is LastW ETH` and ` amount AMin` are independent.

The variable  `  is lastWeth` is defined in function  `_do Swap Tokens` as a local variable, and it is not passed as an argument to the  function. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on any variable in  the `_ add Liquidty` function, which is a different function altogether.
