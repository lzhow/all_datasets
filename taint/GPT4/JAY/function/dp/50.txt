Unknown.

The contract state `start` is not directly referenced or modified in the function `updateFees`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the contract state `start` and the variable `roundID` in the given code snippet. However, without further information about the rest of the contract code, it is not possible to determine if there is an indirect data dependency between these two entities.
