  
No, the `succeess2 ` variable in ` sell` function is not dependent on ` price` variable from ` updateFess` because ` success` and ` sucess2 are two different variables.

The `sucess` is a variable that is used to check if the transfer of Ether to the developer's wallet was successful. It is declared in line 30 of the code.  The ` succes2 is also a local variable declared on line31 of code, and it is only used in function  `onErc 51Received` to return the selector of `IERc`1`5`Receiver`.
