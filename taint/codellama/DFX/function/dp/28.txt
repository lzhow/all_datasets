  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `bytes memory` variable named `returnData` is assigned the result of calling the `.functioncall()` method on an `IER2C` token contract with the data parameter `memory data`. The `function call()` function returns a `byte` array that contains the return value of the called function.
Since the value returned by the call is stored in ` returnData`, it is data-dependent on ` data` because it depends on its value.
