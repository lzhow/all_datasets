   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:
