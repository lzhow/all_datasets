In the constructor function, the `TransparentProxyUpgradable` contract is created with the arguments `address logic`, ` address` admin`, and `bytes memory` data`. The ` logic` variable is passed as the first argument, which means it is dependent on ` admin`. Therefore, `logical` is data-dependent on`admin`.
