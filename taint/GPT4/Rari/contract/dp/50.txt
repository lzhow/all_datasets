Label: no

Reason: The variable `currentCompSpeed` in the function `setCompSupplySpeedInternal` is used to store the current supply speed of a specific `CToken` and is derived from the `compSupplySpeeds` mapping using the address of the `CToken` as a key. It is independent of the variable `i` in the function `claimRewards`.

The variable `i` in the function `claimRewards` is a loop counter used to iterate over an array of `CTokens`. The operations performed inside the loop in `claimRewards` do not affect the `compSupplySpeeds` mapping, and therefore do not affect the value of `currentCompSpeed` in the `setCompSupplySpeedInternal` function.

Since there is no direct or indirect manipulation of `currentCompSpeed` based on the value of `i`, or vice versa, there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables.
