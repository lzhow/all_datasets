In the given code, the `to` variable is passed as an argument to the internal function call `call`, which is a member of the address type. This function takes two arguments: the first is an address, and the second is any type of value. In this case, `value` is being passed to `address.send`, and `("")` is also being sent.
Since the value of ` amount` can change between the time it is read and when it reaches the call, it can be considered data-dependent on ` to`.
