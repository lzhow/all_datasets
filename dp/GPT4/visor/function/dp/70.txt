Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `recover`, the variable `signer` is directly dependent on the variable `s` because it is one of the parameters passed to the `ecrecover` function, which computes the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or an Ethereum transaction. The `ecrecover` function takes four arguments: `hash`, `v`, `r`, and `s`, and returns the address that signed the message. Since `signer` is assigned the return value of `ecrecover`, any changes to `s` would affect the value of `signer`. Therefore, `signer` is data dependent on `s`.
