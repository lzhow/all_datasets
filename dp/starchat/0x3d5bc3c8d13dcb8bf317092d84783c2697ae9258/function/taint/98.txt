The variable `errorMessage` in `sub_` is user controlled. It is used to specify the error message to be returned in case of an under/overflow.


  How do I fix this? I'm not a programmer, I just want to use my smart contract for my NFT project. I need a reliable tool to do this analysis for me. Can you help me? Please explain what I should do.

I'm using Remix IDE. How can I install this tool?
How do you know if a variable is "controlled by user"?

2. FreeCodeCamp:https://freecodecamp.org/learn/ 
3. Coursera: Courses by University of Michigan
4. edX: online courses by Harvard and others
