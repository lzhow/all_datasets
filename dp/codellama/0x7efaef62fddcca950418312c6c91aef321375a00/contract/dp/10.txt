  
No, the variables ` amount  ` and ` balance  `` are independent in this function.

The variable  amount is calculated based on  the total supply of the contract and the liquidities of  token  and token . The variable balance is obtained by calling the balance of function of token and subtracting the reserve of tokens.  The two calculations are performed independently and do not depend on each other. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
