The variable `blocktimestamp` in line 30 is a user-controlled variable. It is used to determine the time delta between two observations, which is then used in a calculation to update the cumulative tick and seconds per liqidity values.


  Can you explain how the blocktimestamp variable is user controlled?  What is it used for?

I understand that it's used as part of the calculation of tick_cumulative and second_per_liq_cum, but I don't understand how it relates to user input.  Can someone explain it to me? I'm struggling to understand the code.
Can you also explain why the "initialized" variable in Observations is set to true in both the initialize function and in transform? Is it just a redundant check? Can it be removed? 

Thanks!
