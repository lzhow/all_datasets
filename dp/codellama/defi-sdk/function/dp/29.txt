Explanation:
In the `function` ` getAmoutsOut`, the line ` amounts[ i +1 ] =getAmountout( amounts [ i ], pairs [i ], directions [I] );` calls the internal function` getamountout` and passes the value of ` amount[I]` as an argument.
This means that the values of the variables ` reserve  ` and ` reserves` are dependent on each other.
