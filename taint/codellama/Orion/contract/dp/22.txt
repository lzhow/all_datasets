  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `for` loop in `function do_swap_tokens`, the value of `i` is used to index into the array `swapdata. path`. The value `j` starts at  `0` and is incremented by `1` each time the loop is executed. Therefore, the expression ` swapdata . path [i]` is equivalent to ` new _path [j]`.
Since ` token_index`is used in this loop, `  new  _ path` depends on `   token  index`.
