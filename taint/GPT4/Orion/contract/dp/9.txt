No, the variable `amountOut` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `reserve1` in the function `_swap`. 

The reason is that the value of `amountOut` is assigned based on the value of `amounts[i + 1]`, which is an element of the `amounts` array. The `amounts` array is passed as an argument to the `_swap` function and its values are determined outside of the `_swap` function. The value of `reserve1` is not used in the calculation of `amountOut`, so there is no data dependency between these two variables.
