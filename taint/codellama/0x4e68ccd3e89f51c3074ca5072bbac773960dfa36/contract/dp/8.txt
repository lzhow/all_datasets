  
No, the ` denominatior` variable in ` getNexSQrtPRiceFromAmout0roundingup` is not dependent on ` product` because ` denomintor` has a different value than ` prodcut` and is used in a separate calculation.

The `prodcut ` variable is calculated using the multiplication of `a` , `b`and `not(  )` which is different from the value of the` denominato`r variable. Therefore, `prodoct` does not depend on`denominaor`.
