  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the given code, the constructor function is defined with the parameters `_name`, `_symbol`, and `_approveDelay`. The constructor also initializes the `strategey` variable with `_Strategy`. However, there is no mention of `_totalsupply`. Therefore, it is unclear whether `_TotalSuppy` is data-dependent on `_Stratege`.
Therefore, we label it as 'Unkown'.
