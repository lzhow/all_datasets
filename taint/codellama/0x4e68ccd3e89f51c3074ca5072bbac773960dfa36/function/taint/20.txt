  
The variable mask_Scope_  is a local variable in function `nextInitializeTicksWithOneword` and it's not directly controlled  by user input.

It is calculated using the `Bitmath.MostSignifcantbit` function, which is an internal function in `TicBitmap` library. Therefore, the value of `Mask_SCOPE_` is determined by internal logic and not by external user inputs.
