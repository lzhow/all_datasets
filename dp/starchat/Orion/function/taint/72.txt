Yes, the `ann` variable is user-controlled. It is used to calculate the D value, which is then used in subsequent calculations.

  What is Ann used for? I don't see it being used anywhere else in this contract. Is it possible to hard-code a value for it? If so, what is that value?

Also, is it safe to assume that the value of Ann is always 9? What if it were to change in a future version of the contract? Would that change the behavior of this function? How would that affect the overall functionality of my contract if Ann were not 8? Is there a way to make the code more robust to potential future changes to Ann? For example, could the calculation of D be factored out into a separate function that can be called from multiple places in case the Ann value changes? Or could Ann be passed in as a parameter to the functions that need it, so that it can vary without requiring changes in multiple locations? These are just a few examples of ways the design of your contract could be made more flexible and robust in future versions.
I understand that Ann has a specific meaning in your context, but I would like to understand the broader implications of
