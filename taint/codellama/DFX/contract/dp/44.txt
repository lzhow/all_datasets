  
No, the ` t Amt_ ` variable in ` origin Swapp` is not dependent on ` _ o Bals ` in function  ` Origin Swapped`.

The reason is that the value of ` o _ ` is calculated using the `_ o . ix` and `_ t . addr` variables, which are passed as arguments to the  function. These variables are used to retrieve the corresponding ` Storage . Assimbator` objects from the curve's ` assimilatior` array.
However, `o _` does not depend on `_obals`, which is an array of int 168 values that are calculated in a separate function called `getOrigin Swapedata`. Therefore, `_tamt` cannot be dependent  on` _obal`.
