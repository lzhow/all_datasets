  
No, the ` amount` variable in function ` _ grant Comp` is data-dependent on variable  ` num Tokens ` in  function  `_ set Comp Speeds`.

The reason is that the  variable amount is assigned the value of the expression `comp. balanceOf (address (this))` in line 427, which is a function call. This function is defined in another contract, and its behavior depends on external factors, such as the state of other contracts and the blockchain. Therefore, it is considered data dependence.
On the other hand,  the num tokens variable is declared in a local scope of function, so it does not have any external dependencies.  Therefore it can be considered as a non-data-dependence.
