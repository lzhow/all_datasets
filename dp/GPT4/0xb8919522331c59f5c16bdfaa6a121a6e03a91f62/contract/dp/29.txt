Yes

The variable `returndata` in the function `getProxyImplementation` is data dependent on the variable `proxy`. This is because `returndata` is assigned the result of a `staticcall` made to the address contained in the `proxy` variable. The `staticcall` is used to execute a read-only function on the contract at the address `proxy` and retrieve the implementation address of the proxy contract. The success of this call and the data returned (which is stored in `returndata`) are directly dependent on the address held in the `proxy` variable. If the address in `proxy` changes, the result of the `staticcall` and thus the contents of `returndata` would also change.
