Label: yes

Reason: In the Solidity contract code provided, the function `redeemVerify` is defined with the following signature:

```solidity
function redeemVerify(address cToken, address redeemer, uint redeemAmount, uint redeemTokens) external;
```

The variable `redeemAmount` and the variable `cToken` are both parameters of the `redeemVerify` function. In the context of this function, `redeemAmount` could be used in conjunction with `cToken` to perform various checks or calculations related to the redemption process of a specific token represented by `cToken`. Since they are parameters of the same function, there is a potential for data dependency between them, as the logic inside the function could use both variables to determine the outcome of the redemption verification process.

However, without the implementation details of the `redeemVerify` function (since this is an interface and the actual function body is not provided), we cannot definitively say how `redeemAmount` is used in relation to `cToken`. But given that they are part of the same operation and could influence the function's behavior together, it is reasonable to classify them as data dependent in the context of this function's signature.
