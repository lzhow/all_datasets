   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to a course that will teach me nothing but how not to write programs.  I've tried it, and I'm not going to lie, it didn't work out.  
   I have heard that the best way is to find a real project that you want to accomplish, that has a clear goal, a set of requirements, someone to help you along the way, etc. and to start coding.
   Is there anything else I can do?  What should I do next?  
   Please help. I need to get this done before the end of the week.   I don't know what to do.   
   Thank you.
