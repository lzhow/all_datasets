The contract has 2 contracts: CEthers and CTokens. CEthe is a contract that inherits from Ctoken.

Ctoken has a function called `_becomemImplementation`. This function is called by the CEtoken contract when it is upgraded. This is done by calling the `_prepare` function on both the old and new contracts. 

In the new contract, the implementation is set to the address of the delegate contract. In the case of CEToken this is CETheDelegate.
