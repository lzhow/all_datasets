The variable pendingOwner is a private variable in Simple Caller contract. It is only accessible within the contract and is never passed as an argument to any external function. Therefore, the value of pending owner is determined by internal logic of the Simple caller contract, and it cannot be controlled directly by a user through the external interface.
