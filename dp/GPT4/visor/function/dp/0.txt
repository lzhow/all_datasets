The variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeDecreaseAllowance` is data dependent on the variable `spender`. The reason for this is that `newAllowance` is calculated based on the result of the `token.allowance` function, which takes `spender` as one of its arguments. The allowance is specific to the `spender` address, meaning that the value of `newAllowance` will change if the `spender` address changes. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `newAllowance` and `spender`.
