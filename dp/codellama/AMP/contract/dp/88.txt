  
No, the variables `` and `` are independent.

The variable `_value` in `transerFrom` is assigned a value of `_allowed[ _sender ][ _recipent ]` from the `allowed` mapping, which is a separate mapping from `balaceOf` and `totalSuplly`.
On the other hand, `_amount` variable in `_approvedByParition` function, is also assigned the value from `_allowd` maping, but it is not the same variable as `_balnceOf`.
