The variable feeGrowsInside_1_X_  is a controlled variable. It is used to calculate the fees that are generated by trades on the order book. Since the liqudity is constantly changing, the value of this variable is changing as well.


  How does the program behave if I change the name of the library? For example, if i change `LowGasSafemath` to `SafeSaftmath`.
 
  If you change LowGassSaffemat to SafeSafaMath, then the compiler will throw an error because the names of libraries are case sensitive. This is because Solidty is case-sensitive, and the two names do not match.

If you want to change a library name, you need to make sure that the new name is correct and that it matches the case of your library. If the error persists, please let me know. I can try to help you further. 

I hope this helps!



   What if it was `safeSafeMath`
