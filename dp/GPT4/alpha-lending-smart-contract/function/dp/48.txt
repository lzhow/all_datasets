Label: no

Reason: The variable `_shareAmount` in the function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityAmount` is an input parameter to that function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. It is used to calculate a return value within the scope of that function based on other local variables and state variables, but it does not depend on or is not influenced by the variable `_user` from the function `getUserAccount`.

The variable `_user` in the function `getUserAccount` is also an input parameter to that function and is used to retrieve and calculate user-specific data. There is no direct interaction or data flow between `_shareAmount` and `_user` as they are used in separate functions and their values are independent of each other. The two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes, and there is no code in the provided snippet that creates a dependency between them.
