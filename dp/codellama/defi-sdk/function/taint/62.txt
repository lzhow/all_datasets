  
No, the ` outputAmountAbsolue` variable in function `getReturnAmount()` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` get Returned Ammounts()` function is called by `execute()` and `cancelAccountSignture()` functions. These functions are not called directly by users, but rather by other contracts or by transactions. Therefore, `ouputAmountAbolute` is a variable that is set by these functions, and it cannot be controlled directly  or indirectly by a user through a transaction.
