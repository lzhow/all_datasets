Label: no

Reason: The variable `target` in the function `functionCall` and the unnamed variable in the function `verifyCallResult` do not have a data dependency relationship. The variable `target` represents the address of the contract being called in the `functionCall` and related functions, while the unnamed variable in `verifyCallResult` is a placeholder in your question and does not correspond to any actual variable in the provided code. Moreover, `verifyCallResult` does not reference `target` or any data that is derived from `target`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `target` and the unnamed variable in `verifyCallResult`.
