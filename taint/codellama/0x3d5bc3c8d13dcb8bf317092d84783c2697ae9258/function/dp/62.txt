The reason is that the two functions are independent of each other. `AccruteInteres`t function is called when the interest rate changes, and it updates the total reservers and borrow index. On the other hand, `repaBorrFress`function is used to repays the borrowed amount, it does not depend on any of the variables in`accrateInterests`
