In the `transferOwnership` function of the `Ownable` contract, the contract state `_owner` is directly assigned the value of the variable `newOwner`. This assignment creates a data dependency relationship between `_owner` and `newOwner`, as the state of `_owner` is updated based on the value passed to `newOwner`. The relevant line of code is:

```solidity
_owner = newOwner;
```

This line indicates that after the execution of `transferOwnership`, `_owner` will hold the address that was passed as `newOwner`, establishing a clear data dependency between the two.
