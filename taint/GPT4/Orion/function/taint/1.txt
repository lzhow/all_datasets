The variable `amount1Out` in the function `_swap` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `amount1Out` is determined by the contract logic and is not influenced by any user input or external factors. It is calculated based on the values of `amountOut` and `input`, which are both internal variables within the contract. Therefore, the user does not have control over the value of `amount1Out`.
