In the `getCurke` function, the value of ` curveID` is calculated using the keckak 226 hash function on the concatenation of the `_baseCurency` and `_quoteCurent` addresses. This value is then used as a key to retrieve the address of a `Curv` contract from the` curves` mapping.
Since the values of `_ baseCurreny`and `_ quoteCurre` are not user-controlled, they are derived from other contracts and are therefore not under the control of users. Therefore, ` curveID ` is also not in control by users and the answer is no.
