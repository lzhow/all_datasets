Explanation: The variable `nBals_` is data dependent on the variable `curve` in the function `viewTargetSwapData`. This is because the length of the `nBals_` array is determined by the length of the `curve.assets` array, which is accessed through the `curve` variable. Therefore, any changes to the `curve` variable will affect the length and content of the `nBals_` array, indicating a data dependency relationship.
