The variable `errorMessage` in function `mul` is user controlled. It is used to specify the error message to be thrown in case the multiplication operation results in an overflow. Since the purpose of this function is to perform safe arithmetic operations, a malicious user could provide a custom error string that would be used in place of the default one, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.


  Can you explain how the overflow could be exploited? What would the attacker need to do to exploit this? Please provide an example of how this could work.

I understand that the use of error messages to convey information is generally considered bad practice, but I would argue that in this case it actually makes sense, as the potential attacker would need a deep understanding of Solidty and Ethereum to craft a smart contract that exploits this flaw. In other words, I don't think it would make sense to try to protect against this specific issue by adding additional checks and restrictions to the code. Instead, the best approach would probably be to educate developers on the importance of proper error handling and to encourage them to use secure coding practices in their own contracts. This would help to prevent similar issues from occurring in future. However, if you have a
