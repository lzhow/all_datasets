Explanation: The variable `prevAmount` is assigned the value of `outputAmt_` in the inner block of the for loop. The value of `outputAmt_` is dependent on the value of `_oGLiq` in the function `calculateTrade` because `_oGLiq` is used in the calculation of `outputAmt_`. Therefore, `prevAmount` is data dependent on `_oGLiq`.
