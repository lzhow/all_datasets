The variable "b" in function "div" is not used in "tryMod". Therefore, "a" and " b" are independent variables.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "The label you give is 'Yes', "No", and"Unknown"."
  
  Yes, No, and Unknown are labels that you can use to classify the data dependence relationship between two or more variables in a Solidty contract.

If the relationship is Yes:
Two or More variables are dependent on each other. This means that changing the value of one variable can affect the other variable's value. For example, if a and b are both dependent variables, changing a's values will also change b's. 

No:  Two or mor variables do not have any data dependencies. Changing the values of these variables will not affect each others values.  For Example, c and d are two independent variable.  

Unknown: This label is used when it is difficult to determine if the variables have data or function dependencies on one another. In this case, you should check the code to ensure that the relationships are correct. 


In your example code, the trymod function has a return
