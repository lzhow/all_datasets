The variable _ nBalls is not dependent on _ weights in calculate trade.  The variable is defined as a parameter in function signature and is passed as an argument when the calculate Trade function is called. Therefore, the value of _nbals is determined by the caller of the Calculate Trade method and not by _weight.
