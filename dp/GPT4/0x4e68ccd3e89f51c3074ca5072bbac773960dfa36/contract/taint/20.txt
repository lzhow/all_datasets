Explanation: The variable `quotient_scope_0` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is calculated based on the inputs `amount`, `sqrtPX96`, and `liquidity`. However, without further context or information about how these inputs are obtained, it is not possible to determine if the variable is controlled by the user or not.
