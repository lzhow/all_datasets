Label: no

Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` and the variable `target` in the function `functionCall` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. There is no direct relationship or dependency between them within the code provided. Each function operates independently, and the parameters are passed in by the caller of the function. There is no data flow or assignment that would create a dependency between `account` and `target`.
