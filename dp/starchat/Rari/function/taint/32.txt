   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to move into a career in software development.
  
   The best way is to start with the basics. A good place to begin is with a free course on Udemy.com called "Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python in 3 hours". This course will teach you the basic concepts of Python and help you build a foundation for further development and learning.
