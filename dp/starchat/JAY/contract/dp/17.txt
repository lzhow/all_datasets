yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_mint` function in line 60 calls the `emit Price` event, which in turn calls `JAXtoEth`, which depends on `_totaSupply`.


  Can you explain why this is data-dependent?
 
  The `_burn` and `_transfer` functions in `ERC223` are marked as `pure` which means that they do not read from or modify the state of the smart contract. However, the event `Transfer` is not marked `view` or `payable` so it can modify state. This means the compiler cannot be sure that `totalsupply` does not change between the two calls.

 
   Can the data dependence be resolved by modifying the code? If so, please provide the modified code. If not, why?
Can you also explain how the optimizer is able to optimize the program in this case? Please provide a short explanation.
