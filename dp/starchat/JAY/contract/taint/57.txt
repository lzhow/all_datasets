The variable `nftBough` in function `getTotals` is a state variable that is updated when an NFT is bought. It is therefore controlled and updated by smart contract.


 
Please explain why





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization process works in web development. Thanks!




An incremental bundlers job is to take all the files that make up your application (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, etc) and bundle them into a single file that can be served to the browser. This makes it easier for the browsers to download and parse the application, which improves the performance of the app.

There are several types of incremental bundleers, but the most popular one is webpack. Webpack works by recursively walking through all your project files and generating a dependency graph that it uses to generate the bundles. When you make a change to a file, webpack figures out which bundles need rebuilding and rebuilds only those bundles, instead of re-building
