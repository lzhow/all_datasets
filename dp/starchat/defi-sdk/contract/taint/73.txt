   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?

An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web application development. It is designed to bundle together the various components of a web page, such as JavaScript files, CSS files and images, into a single file that the browser can load more efficiently.
Incremental bundlers are designed specifically to work with web development tools, allowing developers to make changes to their code, and have those changes automatically reflected in their bundled output file. This makes it very easy to see the effects of changes made to the code during development, without having to manually refresh the web browser to view the changes. Incremental bundlings are also designed so that only the portions of the application that have changed are re-bundled, which can significantly reduce the time taken to update the bundle when changes are made.
