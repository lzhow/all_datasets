yes, the variable `supplySpeed` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is data dependent on the variable `compSpeed` in the function `_setCompSupplySpeed`. 

Explanation: The value of `supplySpeed` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is obtained from the mapping `compSupplySpeeds` using the address `cToken` as the key. The value of `compSpeed` in the function `_setCompSupplySpeed` is assigned to `compSupplySpeeds[cToken]`. Therefore, any change in the value of `compSpeed` will affect the value of `supplySpeed` in `updateCompSupplyIndex`.
