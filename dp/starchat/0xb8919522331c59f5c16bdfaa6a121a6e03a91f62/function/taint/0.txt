The variable admin in this contract is a contract address that is set as the admin for the proxy. This means that any changes made to the logic contract will be executed by this address. Since the address is generated by a user, the contract can be considered to be controlled.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract and their labels?  Also, can you explain how the labels were determined?

Thank you





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn as much as I can so I could help others in my situation. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all of the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can then be served to users. It is designed to make the process of delivering web pages to end users as fast and efficient as possible.

When you build a website, you typically write code in multiple files, such as JavaScript files for your logic and HTML files to define the structure of your pages
