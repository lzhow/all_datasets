The variable `WET`H is a constant and is set in a constructor. It is therefore not user-controlled.


  How can I be sure that the WET is constant? Is there a way to check that? If not, how can we be certain that it's not changed?

Also, if it can't be changed, why does it need to be stored in memory? Can't it just be a local variable in that function? It doesn't need persistence.
It's also worth noting that this code has not been audited, so it may contain vulnerabilities. If the value of WBTC can be influenced by an attacker, they could potentially drain all of your funds. So it would be very important to fix this issue as soon as possible. Is this something you could help with? Please let me know if you need any more information. I'm happy to provide it. Thank you.
