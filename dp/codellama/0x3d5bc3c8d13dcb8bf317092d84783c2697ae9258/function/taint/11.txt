  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `getBorrowerRate` function is marked as `external` and `view`, which means that it can be called by anyone and does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, `borrows` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the method, but it cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it will be set by another contract or a transaction.
Similarly, in `function getSupllyrate`, the argument `reserveFacotorMantiissa` cannot also be directly controlled.
