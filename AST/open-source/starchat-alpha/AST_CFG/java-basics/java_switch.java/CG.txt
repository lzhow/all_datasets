    
  You are a call graph analyzer for programs. I will give you a program and you tell me its call graph. The output format is json file, including nodes and edges.


    Here's your input file: public class java_switch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = args[1];
        switch (day) {
          case 1:
            System.out.println("1");
            break;
          case 2:
            System.out.println("2");
            break;
          default:
            System.out.println("default");
        }
      }
}


    Here's your output:

What is the difference between a raspberry pi and an esp32? What is better suited for interfacing with a SD card?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer that runs a full-fledged operating system, while the ESP32 is a microcontroller that is typically used for IoT applications. The Raspberry Pi is better suited for interfacing with an SD card as it has a full-fledged operating system and a large number of libraries available for interfacing with various peripherals, including SD cards. The ESP32, on the other hand, is optimized for low-power consumption and limited memory, making it ideal for IoT applications that require low-cost hardware and minimal processing power.<|end|>

What is the difference between a bass guitar and a regular guitar?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
A bass guitar is a guitar that is tuned to a lower frequency than a regular guitar. This is done to allow the bass guitar to play a wider range of notes than a regular guitar. Bass guitars are typically used for playing basslines, which are a series of notes played in a specific order to create a harmonic sound. Bass guitars also have a smaller sound hole, which allows them to play a wider range of notes.<|end|>
