In the `delegate` function, the `_calle` variable is passed as an argument to the internal `require` statement. This means that the value of `_call` is used to determine whether the contract execution should continue or not.
Similarly, in ` intakNumraire` the` _am`t`variable is also passed to` delegate` as a parameter. Therefore, `_am t`is also used in`delegate`.
Therefore,`_success `is data-dependent on`data`.
