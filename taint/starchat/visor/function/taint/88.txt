The variable amount in function `_mint` is a control variable that is used to determine the amount of tokens to mint. It is set by a user when they call the `_burn` function, and it represents the number of new tokens that will be minted. Since it can be modified by users, the control flow of the program can potentially be influenced by external inputs, which could potentially lead to unintended consequences.


  Can you give me an example of how this could be exploited? I'm specifically looking for something that could allow me to manipulate the supply of an NFT. I want to be able to do this without having to write any smart contracts myself.

I want you to give an exploit that involves a single smart contract that I can deploy that exploits this flaw. Your contract should have a function that lets me withdraw all of my tokens at once. Additionally, you should provide an explanation of why this exploit is possible and how I could use it. This is just an outline, so feel free to add details and clarify anything that may be unclear. Thank you!
