Reason: The variable `mErr` in the function `getAccountSnapshot` is used to capture the result of the `borrowBalanceStoredInternal(account)` and `exchangeRateStoredInternal()` function calls. It is a local variable scoped within the `getAccountSnapshot` function and is used to handle errors that may occur during the execution of these functions.

On the other hand, the variable `simpleInterestFactor` in the function `accrueInterest` is a local variable that is used to store the result of the interest calculation based on the `borrowRateMantissa` and the `blockDelta`. It is scoped within the `accrueInterest` function and is used to calculate the interest accumulated over a certain number of blocks.

Since `mErr` and `simpleInterestFactor` are local variables within their respective functions, they do not share any state or scope, and there is no direct data flow or dependency between them. Each function operates independently, and the state of one does not affect the other. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
