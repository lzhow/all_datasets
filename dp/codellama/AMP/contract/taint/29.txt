  
The variable 'collatoralmanagers' is a mapping of addresses to bool. It is set to public, so it can be accessed by anyone. Therefore, the answer is yes.

In the constructor, a new mapping is created and assigned to the collatorManages variable. This mapping can only be modified by a function that has the owner role, which is only accessible to a user who has been granted the role.
