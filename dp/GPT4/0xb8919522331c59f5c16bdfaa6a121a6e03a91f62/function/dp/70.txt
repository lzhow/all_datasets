  
The label is 'No'.

In the ` functionfunctionCall` function, the` errorMessag` variable is passed as an argument to the `_verifycallResult` internal function. However, this function does not use the error message variable. Instead, it uses the return data variable, which is not the same as the retu`ret`urn data in `func`tionDelegate`Call`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
