Explanation:
In the first function, the `for` loop iterates over the elements of the array `amount` and the element `i` is used to index into the arrays `input`and `output`. The `if` statement checks if the allowance of `IErc2o(Input)` is less than the amount at index `0` of array amounts. If it is, then the safeIncrementAllowence function is called.
This means that the value of curbalnce is dependent on path, as the input and output arrays are used in determining the cur balance.
