The contract function 'incaseTokensgetStuk' is a function that allows the owner of the smart contract to withdraw any tokens that may have been sent to the address of this contract.

It first checks that the '_token' variable is not equal to address 'want'. This is because the'strategy' contract variable holds the token address that is being used for farming. If '_tokem' was equal 'to want', then the balance of '_toekn' would be sent directly to'msg sender', which would not be the intended behavior. 

Next, the amount of tokens held by the current contract is retrieved from the IER2O contract, and stored in a variable 'amount'.
Finally, Ierc2o contract's'safetransfer' function is called, transferring the tokens from this smart contracts address to '_sender'. 
 The '_sendder' in this case would most likely be a wallet address, where the user would like to receive the withdrawn tokens.
