The variable `utiliztionRate` in `getUtilizationrate` is a result of a calculation and is therefore controlled indirectly by user input. It is calculated using the `_totalBorrow` and `_toalLiqudity` variables, which are both user inputs.


  How does the control flow of the program change if we use assembly to inline the calculation of utilisation rate? Please provide the code with and without assembly
