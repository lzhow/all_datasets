   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am self taught and have no prior experience with coding. Is there a way for me to just dive in and start writing python code? Or do I need to focus on a certain type of project first? I would appreciate any and all help, no matter how small. Thank you!
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python?  What IDE should I use? What libraries should i use to make my life easier? Please provide a step by step process for each of these.  I'm on Windows 10, using Python 3.11.

I'm looking for a beginner friendly IDE that is beginners friendly. Something that will help me write code without getting in my way. 

Please also provide some examples of code that I can use as a starting point. For example, I want to create a program that can take user input and display it on screen. How do i do this?
