The variable returnData is not dependent on proxy. It is a local variable declared within the scope of the getproxyAdmin function.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependent relationship." Could you please explain what that means in this context?
 
  Data-dependent relationship is when one variable or state depends on another variable. In the context of your question, the return data variable is dependent upon the proxy variable, because the value of return Data is determined by the state of proxy at the time the code executes.

In your example, you have two functions, get proxy admin, which takes a proxy as an argument and returns the address of its admin. However, it is possible for the admin to change between the two calls to get Proxy Admin, so the data returned by get Prox Admin is data-dependant on its input. This is why the answer is no, as the relationship between return and proxy is non-deterministic. 

Does this help clarify the concept of data dependence? Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of my responses or provide additional examples. I am here to help you understand how data dependencies work in smart contracts. Let's
