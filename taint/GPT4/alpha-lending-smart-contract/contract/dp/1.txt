The variable `totalAmount` in the function `getReleaseAmount` is data dependent on the variable `toBlock` in the same function. The reason for this is that `totalAmount` is calculated within a while loop that continues to iterate as long as `fromBlock < toBlock`. The value of `toBlock` is used to determine the condition of the loop and to calculate the value of `nextWeekBlock` within the loop, which in turn affects the calculation of `totalAmount`. Specifically, `totalAmount` is incremented based on a multiplication that involves `nextWeekBlock.sub(fromBlock)`, and `nextWeekBlock` may be set to the value of `toBlock` if `toBlock` is less than the initially calculated `nextWeekBlock`. Therefore, changes to `toBlock` will directly affect the computation of `totalAmount`.
