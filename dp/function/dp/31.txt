  
No, the ` mathError` variable in function `accruneInteres` is not dependent on variable  ` error`in function  `_ setReserverFacor`.

The reason is that the  variable`mathError ` is defined inside the scope of the`accrunInterst` function, and it is only used within that function. It is never passed as an argument or returned as a value from any other function or function call. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on any variable defined outside of its own scope.
On the other hand, variable error is a parameter of function _ setreservefactor, which is called within the accruninterst function and is passed to the _accreseinteres function as argument. However, this does not make the error variable data depend on matherror.
