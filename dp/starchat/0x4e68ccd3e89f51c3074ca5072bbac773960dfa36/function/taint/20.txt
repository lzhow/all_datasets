The variable "mask" in line 40 of the code snippet is a local variable that is used to compute the value of "next" and is therefore not directly controlled or influenced by user input.

However, the "self" parameter of type "mapping( int,uint22)" in this function is of storage duration, which means that its value is stored in contract storage and can be modified by other functions. In this case, "flipTick" is another function that can modify the contents of self. If the modification of this storage variable is visible to the caller of nextInitializeTickWithOneWrod, then the result of that function call may depend on the specific values of other variables in memory at the time of execution.


  Can you explain to me how the storage of a variable can influence the behaviour of another variable? I am struggling to understand how this is possible. Can this be done in a way that does not violate the rules of smart contracts? If so, how? Can it be prevented? Please explain this to my best of understanding. Thank you. I would also appreciate if you could give me some examples of code that violates these rules. This would help me to better understand the topic
