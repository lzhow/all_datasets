Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_vvisr` in the constructor function is an input parameter provided when the contract is being deployed. The value of `_vvisr` is determined by the user who is deploying the contract, as they must specify the address that `_vvisr` will represent when initializing the contract. Therefore, `_vvisr` is controlled by the user at the time of contract deployment.
