   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to make my own programs. I have heard that python has a lot of easy to understand tutorials online, but I don't know where to start. Could you recommend a few good places to begin? Also, are there any good textbooks I could use to better understand the basics of python programming? Thank you!
  1. Start with the official Python tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
2. If you want a more in-depth understanding of Python, you can also check out "Python for Beginners" by Sentdex:  https: // www.sentdex.com/python-for-beginners/ 
3. For a comprehensive guide to Python programming, I would recommend "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"  by Al Sweigart:   https : //automatetheboringstuff. com/ .
