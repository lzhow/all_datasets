   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to make my own programs.




I would recommend the official python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will teach you the basics of the python language. After that you can start looking for projects on github that are related to what you want todo. Most projects have a list of beginner-friendly issues that can be solved. If you find one that piques your interest you could try to solve it and ask for help if you get stuck. Good luck!





Thank you for the advice! I'll give it a try. I appreciate your help.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. :)






What are some good websites to practice Python coding on?  I've heard about repl.it, but I haven't tried it.  Do you know of any others?
Also, what IDE should I use? Pycharm? VSCode? Something else? What are your recommendations?
