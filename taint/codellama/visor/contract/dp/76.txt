  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `SaferMath` library, the functions `add`, `mul`, and `div` are defined with the same signature, which includes the variables `uint a` and` uint b`. The `tryAdd`,` tryMult`,and`tryDiv` functions are also defined in a similar way, but they return the result of the operation as a tuple of `(bool success,uint result)`.
These functions use the` require` statement to check for overflows and underflows, and they use a custom error message to display the error.
However, in contrast,the ` sub` function is defined differently, with a signature that includes a third variable, `string memoryerror Message`. This variable is not used in any ofthe arithmetic operations, so it is unlikely to be data-dependent on ` a`.
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is yes, as the data flow of ` error Message` is dependent on` a`, as it can be used to customize the message displayed when an overflow or under flow occurs.
