Explanation: 

The variable `errorMessage` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, but its value is determined by the developer who calls the function. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the variable is controlled by the user based on the provided code snippet alone.
