The variable `success` in the function `buyNFTs` is data dependent on the variable `roundID` in the function `updateFees`. 

Label: yes

Explanation: The variable `success` is assigned the result of the `call` function, which is dependent on the success of the external call. The external call is made to the `dev` address, which is determined by the `roundID` variable in the `updateFees` function. Therefore, the value of `success` is dependent on the value of `roundID`.
