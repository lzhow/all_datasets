  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `defaultParition` variable is used to call the `_approvalByParitition()` function, which is a private function defined in another contract. This function takes four arguments: `partition`, `owner`, `_spende`, and `_amount`. The `msg.send()` is passed as the value of the owner argument, and the _amount argument is set to the amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to spend.
Therefore, `_valu` is not directly dependent on ` ERC_2_0INTER_FACENAME`.
