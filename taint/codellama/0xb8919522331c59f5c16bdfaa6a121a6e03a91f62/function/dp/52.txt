  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `_upgrateToandCall` function takes two parameters: `address newimplementation` and `bytes memorydata`. The function first authorizes the upgrade by calling the internal function `_authorizedUpgrades`. Then, it calls the ` _ upgratetoandcallSecur` internal method with the parameters ` newimplementaion`, `data`, and`true`.
  The `true` parameter is passed to the` _ upgrade toand callSecu` method, which is used to indicate that the call should be made with a low-level call.
   The`_upgradetoAndcall`function is responsible for upgrading the implementation of the current contract to a new implementation. This function is called when a contract is upgraded to use a newer version of its implementation code.  In this function, a call is made to an internal `_ upgrade`method, passing the new `implementation address` as a parameter.   This call to `_ upgra`de is what actually upgades the implementa`tion` ofthe contract. Therefore, `yes` is returned as the answer to your question.
