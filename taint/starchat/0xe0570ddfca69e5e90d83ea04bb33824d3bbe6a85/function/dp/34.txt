The contract function is `nonReetrant`, which means that it cannot be called again until the current call has returned. This means there can be no other calls to `beforeDepost` until after the first call to `_mint` has finished.

`_balances = want()` is a state variable, which is not accessible to other functions. Therefore, it is safe to say that `_balance` is data-independent of `_amout` and `_pool`.


  Can you explain how the code works?
 
  Sure! The code in `function deposit` first calls the `strategy.beforDeposit()` function, then calculates the `_polo` variable by calling the` balance()` method, and finally calls `want().safTransferfrom(senderAddress, thisAddress,_amount)` to transfer the funds from the sender to the smart contract.

 
 
  
  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. How does it work? Explain it to me at a level a novice could understand.
  3. Why would I want to use one? Give me some use cases.

  Incremental bundlers are tools that optimize the delivery of web application assets
