Explanation:
In the `MERKLEPROOF.SOL` contract, the MerkelRoot is a public variable that is immutably set to a value. In the isWhiteListed function, a new variable called node is created by hashing the index variable, which is passed as a parameter to the contract. This means that the node variable is dependent on index.
