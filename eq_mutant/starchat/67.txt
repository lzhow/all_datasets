In the first code example, m is set to  x in line 43, but x is then updated in the if/else block with the line ` x= ( M+ x )/ , which causes m to become undefined. This may result in a NullPointerException when the program tries to access its value later on. However, in its current form the code doesn't appear to be a semantic equivalent to its mutated version. If the author meant to use m instead of M here, it would make the algorithm slightly less efficient due to the additional assignments. 

It's hard to tell exactly why the second mutants have diverged, as the only real difference is in their termination conditions. Maybe the authors meant `while ( diff > epsilon)`, which would be the most correct thing to write in Java since the type of diff is double. But even if it was supposed to run in Double precision, this would still give false negatives for input like `N=2`, because (2-2)^2 is still exactly  `0`, whereas (0.5)^  is approximately `  ~ .25`, so the loop would run much longer than needed before detecting the termination condition.
