The two code snippets you provided are functionally equivalent, meaning that given an input, they will produce the exact same outputs. However, the second code snippet has a bug that can cause the loop to never end. Specifically, it is an off-by-one error in the conditional statement of the while loop.

To check if two programs are truly semantic equivalent rather than just functioning equivalent (which could happen due to some quirks in their respective languages' implementations), it's recommended to compare their outputs for all possible inputs and verify that the outputs are the exactly the thesame. This can be a time-consuming task, but it ensures that there are no subtle differences in behavior that could affect the program's correctness.
