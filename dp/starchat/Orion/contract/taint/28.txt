The variable amount\_spent\_base\_units is a user input and is therefore controlled directly by users.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  What are some common ways to determine if something is "user controlled"?
 
  There are several ways you can determine whether a particular variable or state of a program is under the control of the end user or not. Here are three common methods:

1. Monitoring: You can monitor the program's behavior to see if it changes in response to user inputs. For example, if you have a loop that runs until a certain condition is met, you could monitor how often the loop runs and how long it takes to reach the condition. If the number of iterations or the time taken to complete the task changes significantly when the input changes, then you know that the state or variable you're interested in is being controlled.

2. Profiling: Profilers can help you identify which parts of your program are taking the most time or resources. This can be particularly useful for identifying performance bottlenecks or areas that need improvement. By analyzing the profile data, the profiler can identify the parts that are most likely to be affected by user-controlled variables.
