  
No, the `_ status` variable in function `nonReenrante` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a private variable and it can only be accessed within the contract.

The `_entered` constant is also not user-controlled because its value is set to  `2` in line 3, and the value of `_not_enter` can be changed by changing the `pragma experimental` line.
