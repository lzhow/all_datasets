  
No, the variables ` owner` and ` feeprotocol1 ` are independent.

The reason is that the ` _ updatePosition ` function is a private function that is only called within the contract, and it does not have any external inputs or outputs. Therefore, it cannot be affected by any changes made to the state of the smart contract outside of its own scope.  On the other hand, ` flash ` is an external function, which means it can be called by anyone, including other contracts. As a result, any state changes that occur within ` flush ` can affect the behavior of other functions in different ways. In this case, changes to ` feeprotocol1  ` in `flush` can impact the calculation of ` flipUpper ` and` fipLower `in `_updateposition`, but this does  not mean that `Owner` is data-dependent on `FepProtocol  `.
