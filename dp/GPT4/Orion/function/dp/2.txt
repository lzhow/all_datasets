Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `pool` in the function `pairForCurve` is assigned the return value of the `find_pool_for_coins` function, which takes `tokenA` and `tokenB` as parameters. There is no direct data dependency between `pool` and `from` in the function `getAmountInUniversal`. However, if `tokenA` or `tokenB` are derived from `from` in some way, then there could be an indirect data dependency. Without further information about the relationship between `from`, `tokenA`, and `tokenB`, it is not possible to determine the data dependency between `pool` and `from` with certainty. Hence, the label is unknown.
