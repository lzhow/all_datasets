yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_newshells`, which is calculated in `proportionaldeposit` function, is used to calculate the `curvess` and `deposits_` variables. And the value of `_shellstotal` is also used in calculating the grosliquidity and the balances in  ` getgrosulipidityandbalancesfordeposit`.
So, the two variable have data dependence relationship, and therefore, are labeled as yes.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are calculated?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain!
In the code you provided, there are two functions: ` proportinalDeposit`and `ggetg rosuliplicityandbalanceforDeposit`. The ` gget g rosliplicity and balance for Deposit`function calculates the liquidity of the curve and its balances for each asset in it. This information is then used by the` proporitionalDeposit `function to determine the amount of new shells to mint and to intake depositors' assets into the system. 

To calculate these dependencies, Solidty uses a technique called "static analysis" to analyze your code at compile time. When you compile your
