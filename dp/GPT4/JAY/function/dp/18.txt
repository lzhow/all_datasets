The variable `_p_scope_0` in the function `updateFees` is data dependent on the variable `price` in the same function. 

Reason: The value of `_p_scope_0` is computed based on the value of `price` using the division operation `_price.div(USD_PRICE_SELL)`. Therefore, any change in the value of `price` will affect the value of `_p_scope_0`, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
