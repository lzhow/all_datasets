  
No, the `variable amountWithInFactor` is not dependent on `the variable reserveout` because the value of ` amountwithinFacor` does not change when the values of the variables ` reservein` and ` reserverout ` change.

The value `of amountinwithFecor ` is calculated using the formula ` ( amount in *9  ) /  (  reserve in  *1  +amountin *  9 ) `, which doesnot depend on any of these variables. Therefore, it is independent of them.
