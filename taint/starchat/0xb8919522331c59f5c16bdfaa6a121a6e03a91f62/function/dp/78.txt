   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but this is my first time trying to program. Can you recommend a few good resources for me to use to get started with python, and some good ways to keep me motivated? I'm specifically looking for things that will help me become proficient in just a couple of weeks. Thanks!
   

  What are some of the most popular beginner-friendly languages?

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language. It is often compared to a scripting language, as it was designed for interactive use rather than for writing software that runs continuously.
It offers a wide range of libraries and modules that support many aspects of programming, including:
a. Mathematics
b. Graphing and data visualization
c. GUI development
d. Networking
e. Database access
f. System administration
g. Testing and debugging
h. and much more
