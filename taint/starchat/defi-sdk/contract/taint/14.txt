The variable input in hashProtcolFeeSignaturData() is user controlled.


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because the input is a struct that contains user-controlled data? Or is it something else? Please explain your reasoning.
If it's the former, then why is this a problem? What are some examples of user input that could be used to manipulate the contract? How would the attacker use this to their advantage? If it isn't the first, please explain what else is going on. I'm just trying to understand the underlying reason for the control flow analysis. Thanks!
