The contract variable ` totalSuppyByPartion` is not directly data-dependent on `_ value` because it is only updated in two places:

- When `_ removeTokenfromPartition()` is called, the value of `_partition` determines which partition's total supply is being updated.
If `_ partition` does not equal the default partition, then ` _ removePartitionfromTotalPartitionss()` will be called and `TotalSupplybyPartition [_partition]` will decrease by `_Value`.
Otherwise, if `_Partition == defaultpartition`, then the total default supply will also be decreased by`_value`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data-dependency is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value depends on another. In the context of Solidty, data dependence refers to how a variable's value is used to calculate another variable. For example, in a Solidit function, a local variable may depend on a state variable, or another local or global variable in that function.
