In the given code, the `WETH` contract has a private `immutable` variable called ` w eth_`. This variable is initialized in its constructor with the address of the WETHER token. This means that the value of `we th_ ` is set at the time of contract deployment and cannot be changed later.
Since the contract does not have any function to update the state of this variable, ` we th _` is under the control of only the deployer of  the smart contract. Therefore, we can conclude that `We th` in this function is NOT controlled  by user input.
