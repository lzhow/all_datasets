Label: no

Reason: In the given Solidity constructor code, `_totalSupply` is not explicitly mentioned. However, by the context of ERC777, we can infer that `_totalSupply` would be modified by the `_mint` function, which is called with `initialSupply` as an argument. The `_mint` function typically increases the `_totalSupply` by the amount of `initialSupply`. The variable `defaultOperators` is passed to the ERC777 constructor but does not influence the `_mint` function or the `_totalSupply` directly. The `defaultOperators` parameter is likely used to set up a list of addresses that have special privileges in the ERC777 token contract, such as being allowed to transfer tokens on behalf of others. Since there is no direct interaction or dependency between `_totalSupply` and `defaultOperators` in the provided code, we can conclude that `_totalSupply` is not data dependent on `defaultOperators`.
