  
The variable 'redemptionTokes' in function 'reddemVerifty' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the ' redemptioToks' variable is passed as an argument to the external function. This means that it can be controlled or manipulated by an external user or attacker.

In general, any variable that is used as a parameter in an externally accessible function should be considered as controlled and potentially vulnerable to manipulation by a malicious user, unless it has been specifically designed to be immutable or secure.
