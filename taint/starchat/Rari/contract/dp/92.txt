The contract has a function called `updateCompSupplierAndBorrowersIndex`. This function is called in two places: `flywheelBorrowPreAction` and `claimRewards`.

In ` flywhelBorrowrAction`, the `compSupplierState` is updated, and the borrow index is calculated. Then, the two lines `Double memory newSupplierindex =add_(newSupplierMantis, fraction);` are executed.
`newSuppliermantis` depends on `newDeltaIndex`, which is a local variable in ` distributeSuppliersComp`. So, ` mantisOne ` is data-dependent on` deltaInde`.

   An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web pages by combining multiple files into a single file.
