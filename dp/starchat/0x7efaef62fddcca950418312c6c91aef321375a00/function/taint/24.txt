The variable klast is a state variable in Pangake Pair contract. It is used to store the price of the token pair. Since it's a price, and it can be influenced by anyone, the answer is no.


  How can I make sure that the k last is always updated? I want to make a prediction market for the prices of cryptocurrencies. I need to be able to update the state of my contract based on the actual price. How do I do this? Please explain in detail.

I want you to write a solidity program that takes the current price for two cryptos and updates the contract accordingly. This program should be called by an oracle. Your program must be secure and cannot be hacked by anybody. If you are not familiar with solidity, you can start with this example: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/miguelmota/9989e9394968879f9291e678e838636d/raw/77e3e0959b733474e5828c8fbef90813f766f8
