  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `ifAdmin` modifier is applied to the entire function. This means that the condition is checked before the execution of the rest of function body.
However, in function 2, there is no such modifiers. Therefore, it is possible that ` _ upgrade toAndcall` is called before ` newimplementation` and ` data` are assigned. In this case, ` upgradetoAnd call` would depend on `  new implementation`and `   data`.
Therefore, we can conclude that there are two possible scenarios: either ` upgradoToandCall` depends on both ` NewImplementaion` `and` data`, or it does not depend either. Since we cannot determine the order of execution, this is labeled as 'Unknown'.
