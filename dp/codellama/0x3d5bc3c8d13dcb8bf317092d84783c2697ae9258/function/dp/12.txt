  
No, the variables ` srcTokenNew ` and ` exchange rate ` are independent.

The variable  `  src TokenNew  ' is defined in function  transferToken  and is not used in  exchange RateStorInternal  function.  The variable exchange  rate is also defined  within the  scope of  the exchangeRatestoredinternal  method. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
