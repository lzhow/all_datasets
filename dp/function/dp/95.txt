  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `lessThinOrEQualExp` function, the expression `left.manitissa` is compared to ` right .maniitssa`. The `manittssaa` variable is a member of the struct `Exp`, which is passed as an argument to the  ` lessTinOrequalExp ` function. Therefore, ` left . maniittsaa` depends on ` b `, which  is also a variable in ` sub _ `.
