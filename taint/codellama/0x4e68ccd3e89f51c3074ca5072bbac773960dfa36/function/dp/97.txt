  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `transform` function, the value of `last` is updated based on `blockTimeStamp`, `liqudity`, and `delta`. The value `secondsCulmulative` of the updated `Obseravtion` object is calculated using the formula `int268(seconds_per_liquity_cummulitive_x102 * 2^152) + (delta * tick)`.
Here, `second_Per_Liuity` and  `Delta` are both dependent on  the input `Luidity`.
Therefore,  tick is data-dependent on self.
