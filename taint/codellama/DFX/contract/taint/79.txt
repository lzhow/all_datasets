  
No, the ` balance _` variable in function `Balanceof` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created and used within the scope of the  function. It is a private variable and it can only be accessed within this function, so it cannot be controlled or manipulated by any external user or program.

The `curv. balances [_account]` variable is also not user-controlled because the `_account` parameter is passed as an argument to this method, and the value of this parameter can be anything, including a user' s address. However, this variable can still be manipulable by an attacker who has access to a valid address, but it would require a more sophisticated attack.
