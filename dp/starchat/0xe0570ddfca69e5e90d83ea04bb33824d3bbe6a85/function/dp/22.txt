The contract constructor takes in four parameters: `_name`, `_symbol`, and `_approval_delay`. The `_stragegy` parameter is not used in this function.

`_name` and`_symbol` are used to initialize the `name_` and `symbol_` contract variables, respectively. These variables are then used throughout the smart contract. Therefore, it is possible that these variables could be data-dependent on other contract or state variables. However, this is purely speculative and would require a more in-depth analysis of the code.


  Can you explain how you arrived at that conclusion?
 
  I analyzed the constructor function and identified that the `_balance` variable is dependent on `_stratey`.
