The variable `amount1` in the function `mint` is data dependent on the variable `amount0` in the same function. This is because both `amount0` and `amount1` are calculated based on the contract's reserves (`_reserve0` and `_reserve1`) and the balances (`balance0` and `balance1`) of the tokens held by the contract. The liquidity (`liquidity`) that is minted is the minimum of two ratios: `amount0.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve0` and `amount1.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve1`. Since the calculation of `liquidity` involves both `amount0` and `amount1`, and the amount of liquidity minted affects the state of the contract, there is a data dependency between these two variables. The minting of liquidity is a process that is dependent on the proportionate amounts of both tokens provided to the pool, and thus `amount0` and `amount1` are interrelated.
