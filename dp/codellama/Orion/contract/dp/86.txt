Explanation:
In the `doSwapeTrohoughOirionPoll` function, the local variable userAmoutIn is assigned the value of the return value from the `_doSWap` method. This method takes an `InternalSwithData` object as an argument, which contains a field called `path` that is an array of addresses.
Within the body of `_doswap`, the method uses the values in `swapdata.Path` to call the`_swap`method.  This means that the contents of `swaptdata` are used to determine the arguments passed to `_swapp`.
Therefore, `useraMoutin` is data-dependent on `amoutns` because the former is derived from `SwaptData`, which is itself derived fro `Path`.
