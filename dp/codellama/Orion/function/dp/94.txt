  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `tryMUL` function, the variables `a` and `c` are both declared as `uint 2 5 6` types, which are fixed-size integers. Therefore, their values are determined at compile time and are independent of the values of other variables.
On the other hand, in `Sub` , the type of `errorMessage` is `string memory`, which is a dynamic string type. This means that the value of this variable can change at runtime and is dependent on other factors. In this case, it is data-dependent on ` b`.
Therefore, `B` in`trymul`is datadependent`b`.
