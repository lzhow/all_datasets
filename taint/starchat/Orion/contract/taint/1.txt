The variable reserve in function `_swap` is user controlled.


 
Please explain why.

Is it because the contract is a pool for liquity?
Or because it's a smart contract that is meant to be used by users?  If so, why is it written in Solidty?  
If it was meant for the liqidity pool, then why does it use Orin's pool? 

I'm trying to understand the code, but I'm having a hard time understanding it.  I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me in a way that I can understand.   I know it may be a bit complicated, and I don't expect you to know everything, so I appreciate you taking the time to explain.  

Thank you





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it like I am five. I will provide some code examples too, that might help to clarify my questions. Thanks in advance!



  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served
