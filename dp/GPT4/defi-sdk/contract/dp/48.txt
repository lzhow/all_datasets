yes

The variable `allowance` in the function `handleTokenInput` is data dependent on the variable `token` because `allowance` is assigned the result of the `IERC20(token).allowance(account, address(this))` function call. This means that the value of `allowance` is determined by querying the allowance of the `account` for the contract's address (`address(this)`) on the specific ERC20 token contract referenced by `token`. The `token` variable is used as an argument to identify which token contract's allowance method should be called, thus creating a data dependency between `allowance` and `token`.
