Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity code, within the `constructor` of the `PoolConfiguration` contract, the contract state `excessUtilizationRate` is directly assigned the value of the constructor argument `_excessUtilizationRate`. Similarly, the contract state `rateSlope2` is assigned the value of the constructor argument `_rateSlope2`. Although these two states are assigned values from different constructor arguments, they do not have a data dependency relationship within the constructor itself.

However, the `calculateInterestRate` function shows a data dependency between `excessUtilizationRate` and `rateSlope2`. In this function, if the `utilizationRate` is greater than `optimalUtilizationRate`, the `excessUtilizationRateRatio` is calculated using `excessUtilizationRate`, and this ratio is then used in conjunction with `rateSlope2` to calculate the return value. This indicates that `excessUtilizationRate` influences the calculation that involves `rateSlope2`, establishing a data dependency relationship between them within the context of the contract's logic.

Therefore, even though the direct assignment in the constructor does not establish a data dependency, the usage of these variables in the `calculateInterestRate` function does, which means that `excessUtilizationRate` is data dependent on `rateSlope2` within the broader scope of the contract's functionality.
