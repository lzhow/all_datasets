  
No. They are NOT sematically equal because of the difference in the `if` statement. In the original code, it checks if `diff` < `0`, while in mutated code it first decrements ` diff` by  `1` then checks the condition. Therefore the mutation changes the meaning of `sqrt` function and the output may be different.
