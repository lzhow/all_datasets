   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how. I have heard that there are many different paths to learning to program and that the most important thing is to just start. What should I do? I really want to start learning how program, but I just don't know where to begin. Can you give me some tips? Maybe some good websites to read? Or maybe some books? Please be as specific as possible. Thank you.

I am a 17 year old boy. My sister is 9 and my brother is seven. We have 3 cats and 2 dogs.  I like to play video games, read books, and watch anime. In my free time I enjoy going to the park, going on hikes, playing with my toys, reading manga, doing arts and crafts, painting, baking, making music, practicing guitar, hiking and camping. 

Please ask me any other
