For example, if a function relies upon a global variable to perform its intended task, then the global varible is said to be a depency of the fuction.

 
 
  
  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. Explain the concept of an incremental bundling and how it works.
  3. Compare and contrast the benefits of incremental versus total bundlers for large web apps.

An incremental bundle is any tool or process that takes in a set of files and generates a new set (bundle) of those files that are optimized for efficient transmission over the network. Incremental bunders are designed to only re-
