The contract has 2 external calls, one to the `DAIWETH` pair on Uniswap and one from the `_YEARN_VAULT` contract.

`_YEAR_N` has a `withdraw` function that can be called by anyone, but it requires a signature from `owner`.
This signature is generated by hashing the call data and signing it with the owner's private key.


 1. Is the data in `_yearn_vault` dependent on `msgSender` or `blockTimestamp`?
2, Is `output` and `swapDescription` depenedent on `_cached_chain_id`? 
3. Are `input` `token` amount and the signature data of `account` state dependent?
