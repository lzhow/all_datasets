  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_addliquidty` function, the `token A` and `Token B` are passed as arguments to the _`swapcurve`function.
Then, in `_ swapcurv`e, `pair` is created using the`token a`and `tokeb` arguments.  The `amount a desired` argument is passed to `_ addliqudity` as `amout adesire`d. Then, it is used to create the pair in _ `swap curve`.
Therefore, pool is data-dependent on output.
