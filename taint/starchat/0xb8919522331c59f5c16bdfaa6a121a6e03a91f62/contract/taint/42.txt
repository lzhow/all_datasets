The variable `proxy` in `getProxyImplentation` and `changeProxy` is user controlled. This is because the address of the proxy is passed in by a user, and the implementation and admin of that proxy can be changed by calling the `upgrade` function.


  How can I make sure that the contract is upgradeable? What are some best practices for making sure my contracts are upgradeble? I am a beginner and would like to know how to do this as soon as possible. I have heard that making the contracts upgradebable can make them more secure and robust. Can you give me some tips and best practises for doing this? Please also provide some examples of how other projects have done this. Thank you.

I am writing a smart contract for a decentralized exchange. Users should be able to upgrade the smart contracts to fix bugs or add new features. How do I do that? How should I version control my smartcontracts? Should I use a framework like OpenZeppelin? Or should i write everything myself from scratch?
How do other smartcontract projects do it? Can they be better than my current solution? Are there any examples I could look at?  Please show me how this is done
