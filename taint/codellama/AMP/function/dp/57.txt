In the given code, the `_approvedByParition` function is called, which is a function that updates the state of the smart contract. This function takes in four parameters: `_partition`, `_sender`,`_receiver`, and `_value`. The `_allowedbyPartion` is an array that stores the allowance of each address for each partition.
  The function updates this array by adding the value of `_addValue`.
   The variable` _addvalue`is not used in this function, so it is not dependent on it. Therefore, it can be labeled as 'NO'.
