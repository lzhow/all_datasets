  
No, the variables ` token A` and ` to` are independent.

The variable token is a parameter of the `pairfor` function, which is not dependent on any other variable in this contract. On the other hand, `the variable to is` a local variable of `_ swap` that is only used within the scope of this function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
