Label: no

Reason: The contract state `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER` is a constant string defined at the beginning of the contract and is used to represent an interface name for the ERC1820 registry. It is not a variable, but a fixed value that represents a specific interface identifier within the contract.

On the other hand, the variable `partitionManagerImplementation` within the function `_callPostTransferHooks` is a local variable that is assigned the address of a contract that implements the partition strategy validator interface, based on the `_toPartition` argument passed to the function. This address is retrieved using the `interfaceAddr` function from the ERC1820 registry.

Since `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER` is a constant and does not change, and `partitionManagerImplementation` is a local variable that is determined independently of `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER`, there is no data dependency relationship between them. `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER` remains the same regardless of the value or state of `partitionManagerImplementation`, and `partitionManagerImplementation` is computed without any reference to `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER`.
