  
The variable 'pengingOwner' is a state variable in Solidiy contract. It is defined in Base contract and is inherited by TokesHandler contract through Ownerable contract, which is also inherited from Base Contarct.

Therefore, the answer is 'No'. The variable is owned by Base and not by user, and it cannot be controlled directly by a user through the contract interface.
