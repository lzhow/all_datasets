The contract variable reserve1 is not directly data-dependent on balance 1 in mint. However, it is possible for the value of reserve 2 to be determined by the values of balance and reserve0:

reserve2 = (balance2 * total_supply) // reserve2
= (amount2 + balance2) * (total_suply - liquity)
/ reserve_2 - balance_1
However, this relationship is only true if the ratio of total supply to liqidity remains constant. If the total suply increases, the liqueness decreases, and vice versa, then the relationship between balance, reserve, total and liquidty may no longer hold.


  Can you explain this in layman's terms?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.
In the code you provided, there are two contract variables that are related to each other through mathematical operations. These variables are reserve and balance. Reserve represents the amount of one token that is held in reserve in exchange for another token. In the example you gave, we are looking at a Pancakeswap exchange, which is a decentralized exchange that allows users
