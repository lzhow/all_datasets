The variable "compressed" in function "nextInitializedBitWithinOnWord" is user-controlled because it's derived from a user input "tick" and "ticSpacing".


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic.





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most simplistic syntax compared to other languages, is that true? Are there any good textbooks or other resources that I could use to get started with python programming? Please respond in iambic pentameter.
