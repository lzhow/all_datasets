In the `depostitET` function, the amount of Ether to be deposited is passed as an argument to the internal function call `IWTH9.depoist`. The `value` parameter of the deposite function is set to `amout`, which is a variable in `depostit`.
On the other hand, in function getamountOut, `reserverIn` and `reverserOut` are calculated based on ` amountin` which are also variables in get amount out.
Therefore, amount in deposetEt is data-dependent on numeratior in GetAmountout.
