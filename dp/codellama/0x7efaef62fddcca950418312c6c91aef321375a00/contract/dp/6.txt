  
No, the ` balanceAdjuted` variable in function  ` swap` is not dependent on ` balanace1 ` variable  from the same function.

The reason is that the  variable is calculated using the balance of the token at the beginning of function, which is ` reserve  balance  `. The balance at this point is already calculated and is independent of any changes that may occur later in  the code. Therefore, it is safe to say that `  balancAdusted ` is data-independent.
