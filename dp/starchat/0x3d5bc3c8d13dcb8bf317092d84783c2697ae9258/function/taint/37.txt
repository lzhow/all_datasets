  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? I've heard that it can be hard to determine if something is truly user input or not.
 
  It can indeed be difficult to distinguish between user and program-generated input. However, there are some techniques and heuristics that can help you identify user control. Here are five tips:

1. Check for obvious signs of user interaction: If the input is displayed to the screen or recorded in a log file, for example, you can assume that user is responsible for its value.

2. Consider the context: The input may be derived from other user inputs or program outputs. In this case, check if any of these inputs are controlled directly by users. If so, then the current input must be user generated. 

3. Analyze the code: Look for explicit assignments to user variables. For example:

a = input("Enter a number: ")
b = a + 1
print(b
