The variable implementation is a contract address that is stored in a mapping in CEtheDelegate. This mapping is used to store the current implementation address of the CEthDelegate contract.

It is possible for the implementation variable to be modified by a user, but this would require a high level of access to the contract, which is unlikely to happen. Therefore, the control flow of this variable cannot be determined to have been controlled directly by any user input.


  How can I check if a variable is user controlled? I want to know how to do that. I know about symbolic execution, can you give me some examples of how I can use that to check for user control? How would I do it? What are the pros and cons of doing it that way? Can you also give some tips on how can i do static analysis to find user controllable variables? Please provide examples for all of these. Thank you.  I am looking for a comprehensive guide on this topic. If you can provide me with a good starting point I will do my best to follow it and provide you with the information you are looking  for. 

I want you to answer all my questions. Do not ask me any follow up questions until you have finished answer
