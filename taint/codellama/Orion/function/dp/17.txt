Explanation:
In the `isContrac` function, the local variable 'size' is assigned the value of the external code size of an account. This value is dependent on 'account', which is a parameter of 'isContrct' function.
On the other hand, in 'functioncallWithvalue' the 'target' variable is used to call the contract. However, this does not mean that ' size' in isContrat is data-dependent on target in functioncallwithvalue.
