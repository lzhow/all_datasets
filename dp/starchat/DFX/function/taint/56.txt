The variable y in us\_div() is user-controlled because it can be influenced by an attacker.

An attacker can manipulate y to cause the division to revert or to produce incorrect results.


  Can you give me an example of how an attack could be performed? I'm not very good at maths





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most user friendly syntax compared to other languages, but I am not sure if that is true.  Please explain to me why python is considered the easiest language to start with.   Also, please provide me with some good first steps to get me started with python.    Thank you.    
    Python is an interpreted language, which means that it does not require a compilation step. This makes it easier to write and debug code, as you can see the results of your changes almost instantly. Additionally, Python has a large and active community, meaning that there are many resources available to help you learn. Some good places to begin are the official Python documentation, tutorials, and courses. Another good resource is Stack Overflow, where you will find answers to many programming questions. Good luck
