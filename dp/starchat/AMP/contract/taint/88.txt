The variable "``" in function "transfer" is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the input to this function may be used to indirectly control the value of the "variable".

In this case, "msgSender" (the sender of this message) is used as the control variable. This variable is set to the sender address of any transaction that calls the transfer function.
However, this variable can be overwritten by a malicious actor, who could provide a different value for "messageSender". This could result in unintended consequences, such as transferring tokens from the wrong account.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make sure that the msgSender variable cannot be changed by maliucious actors? I'm not very experienced with solidity, so I don't know what the best practices are in this regard. Can you give me some tips?
Can you also explain how the code works? What does the _ call mean? How does it work? Can I just copy and paste it into Remix and use it? Or do I have to change something? Please explain it to me like I am five. Thank you!
