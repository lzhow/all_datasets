Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_delta` in the function `calculateFee` is data dependent on the variable `_ideal` in the same function because `_ideal` is used as an argument in the function `calculateMicroFee`, which means the value of `_ideal` affects the computation of `_delta` within the function.
