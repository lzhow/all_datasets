The contract has a function called `earn()` that transfers the earnings from `want()` to `address (strategy)`. The `balance()` function returns the total balance of the vault, which includes the balance in `IStraegy ( strategy )`. The total supply of `BeeFyVault` is equal to  `0` when the first user deposits, and the `total supply` increases as more users deposit.

Therefore, the data in contract `state` ` strategy` depends on `variable shares` because the value of `_after` decreases as the user's deposit increases.


 
Please explain how the code works. I am not a programmer and I don't understand what the functions do
