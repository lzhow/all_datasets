  
No, the variables ` token` and `_ token  ` are independent.

The variable` token ` is defined in function `_safe Transfer` as a parameter of the `transer` function. It is not dependent on any other variable in this function, and it is only used to call the` transfer` method of an ERC-2O token contract.  The variable  `_  token   `is defined as the address of token zero in ` burn`function. However, this variable is also not used in any way in` burn`.
