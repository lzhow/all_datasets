   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but is afraid that it will be too difficult. Could you recommend a few good ways for me to become proficient in Python? I know some other languages like C++ and Java, and I want to know if Python is similar or different. Thank you!
   

  What are some good websites to practice Python on?  I'd like to be able to do some simple projects to get a feel for it.  Thanks!  Also, what IDE should I use?   I've used Pycharm before, is that a bad choice? Thanks again!

I'm looking for something that's easy for beginners to use, that also has a lot of useful libraries.
If you could recommend me a couple of good resources, I would be very grateful!  
Thanks! :)
