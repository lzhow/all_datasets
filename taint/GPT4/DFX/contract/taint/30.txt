Explanation: The variable `_nGLiq` in the function `targetSwap` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the values returned from the `getTargetSwapData` function, which retrieves data from the `curve` storage and performs calculations using internal logic. The user does not have direct control over the calculation of `_nGLiq`.
