yes

In the `functionDelegateCall` function within the provided Solidity code, the variable `success` is directly dependent on the variable `target`. The `success` variable is assigned the result of the `delegatecall` operation, which is a low-level function call that delegates the call to the address specified by `target`. The `delegatecall` is used to execute the code at the `target` address with the current contract's storage, and the success of this operation is inherently dependent on the `target` address provided. If the `target` is not a contract or the call to the contract fails for any reason, `success` will be `false`; otherwise, it will be `true`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `success` and `target`.
