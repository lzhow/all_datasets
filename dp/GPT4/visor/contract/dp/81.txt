The variable `spender` in the function `safeIncreaseAllowance` is data dependent on the variable `newAllowance` within the same function. This is because `newAllowance` is calculated based on the current allowance of `spender` (retrieved by `token.allowance(address(this), spender)`) and the `value` to be added to it (`.add(value)`). The resulting `newAllowance` is then used in the subsequent call to `token.approve(selector, spender, newAllowance)`, which sets the allowance for `spender` to the newly calculated `newAllowance`. Thus, there is a direct data dependency between `spender` and `newAllowance` as the latter's value is used to determine the allowance set for the former.
