  
No, the ` swap type` variable in function `getReturnAmount` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The `Swaptype` parameter is passed to the getreturnAmount function as an argument, and it cannot be modified by any user input or external factors. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled internally by your contract.
