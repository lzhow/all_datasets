yes, the `_defaultoperators` variable is a mapping of addresses to booleans, which means that it can be modified by calling the `authorizeOperator` and `revokeOperator functions`.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what you mean by "mapping of address-to-boolean" and how it relates to "controlled by user."





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, and L moves. J and P are the basic algorithms of the cube, while L is used to solve the last layer.
The J algorithm, also known as the "inner" algorithm or "core" of a JP-LL sequence, is responsible for the majority of cubes. It consists of 21 basic J moves, each of which swaps two adjacent edges. These moves can also be combined into longer chains, known collectively as J chains. For example, a 3-move J chain consists three J1 moves (one for each edge).
Similarly, there are 8 P algorithms, one for every possible permutation
