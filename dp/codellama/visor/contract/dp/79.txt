  
No, the data dependence relationship between the `_type_hash` contract variable and the ` amount` variable in function  ` burn` is unknown.

The reason is that the value of `_ type_ hash` does not depend on any input parameters, including `  amount`. The value is set in  the constructor and does  not change during the execution of the smart contract. Therefore, there is no data  dependence between `_  type _ hash ` and `   amount `.
