   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it. I want to do something useful with it that pays the bills. What should I do? I have heard that the best way is to just start using python and see where it takes you. Is that true? If so, how do I start? Please help. This is my third day trying to start learning python. It is frustrating.  I also heard people talk about "practice makes perfect" but I don't know where to begin. Can you give me some advice? What are some good first projects I could do with python that would be useful?  Please be very specific. For example, if it is data analysis, please give an example of a useful project I can do. If it's web development, give a project that involves creating a website. And so on. Thank you very much.
