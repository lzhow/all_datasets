  
The variable _ logic in function contructor is labeled as ' yes'. The reason is that the constructor function takes the address of the logic contract as an argument, which means that it can be controlled or modified by a user who calls the contract.

In the context of a smart contract, the term "user" refers to an external entity that interacts with the smart contact, such as a person or a program. In this case, a malicious user could potentially modify the value of _logc by passing a different address to the contructur function, potentially leading to a security vulnerability. Therefore, we label the _ logc variable as controlled.
