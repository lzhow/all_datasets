Reason: The variable `b` in the function `tryMul` and the variable `b` in the function `div` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. They are not dependent on each other because they are local to their own function's execution context and do not share state or influence each other's values outside of their function scope. Each time the functions are called, `b` could be different and independent values, and changes to one within its function do not affect the other.
