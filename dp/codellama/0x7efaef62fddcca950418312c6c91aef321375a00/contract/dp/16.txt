  
No, the variables ` rootklast` and `_ klast ` are independent.

The variable` root k last` is calculated in function` _ mintFEE` as the square root of the product of `reserver0`and ` reservoir1`.
On the other hand, variable _ k Last is a local variable in `_ mintFEE` function and is not used in any other function. Therefore, it is independent of variable root K last.
