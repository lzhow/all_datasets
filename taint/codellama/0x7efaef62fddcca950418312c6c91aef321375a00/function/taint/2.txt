  
No, the ` liquid` variable in function `_m intF` is uncontrolled by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the current state of the contract. It is used to calculate the fee that needs to be paid to the liquidty provider, but it does not come from the input of any user-controlable variable. Therefore, its value is determined by internal factors of smart contract and cannot be controlled directly by users.
