In the given code, the `sub` function is defined as follows:
`function sub ( uint 2 5 6  x , uint  2  5  6   y ) internal  pure  returns  (  uint   2   5   6    z ) {  require  ((  z  =  X  -  Y )  <=  Z  );  }`
This function takes two arguments `X` and `Y` of type `uint 32` as input and returns a value of the same type.
It then performs a subtraction operation on `Z` using the values of ` X`and ` Y` .
Then it checks if ` Z` is less than or equal to ` x` , and if it's true, then it returns ` z` otherwise it reverts the transaction.  The `require` statement is used to check if a condition is true. If the condition fails, an exception is thrown. In this case, if `(z=x-y)<=x`, then the substraction is valid, otherwise, a revert is triggered. Therefore, `z` cannot be controlled directly by a user input. It is calculated based on the input values `y` `and x`.
Therefore, in this function, variable x is uncontrolled by user inputs.
