The variables `data` and `errorMessage` are function parameters and are thus not considered in this analysis.

In the `internal` function, `isContrac`t is a Solidty function that checks if an address is indeed a contract. It does so by checking if the code at the given address has been deployed and thus has a code size greater than 2. If the address does not have code, it is not a valid contract address. This means that the result of the check is independent of `daata`.
`target.delegetecall` is another Solidit function. As the name suggests, this function delegates the call (i.e., executes the called function) to the contract at address `targe`. The function call is made with the provided `bytes` data. However, the execution of this call can also fail for various reasons, such as running out of gas, reverting the callee's state, or encountering an invalid instruction. In the case of a failure, an error message is returned. Since this error mesage is also a function parameter, and since the error is only returned in case the delegatecall fails, we can conclude that `taget` does depend on `dat`
