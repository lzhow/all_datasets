The contract variable `_NOTENTERED` is not used in this function, so it cannot be data-dependent on `transferrableTokens`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data-dependency is a term used to describe how one variable or value in a program depends on another. In the context of your question, it means that the value of the `notEntered` variable is dependent on some other value or variable.

In your code, the `_entered[_account]` variable appears to be dependent upon the input parameter `account`. This means the behavior of this variable will change depending on what value is passed in for `accounts`.
If the data in `_entred[_accounts]` is updated in one part of code but not in another, then it is possible for the two parts of a code to have different values for `_accounts`, and thus have differing behavior.
