In the Solidity code provided, the variable `returndata` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is data dependent on the variable `value` in the same function. This is because the `value` variable is used in the call to the `target` contract:

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{ value: value }(data);
```

Here, `value` is specifying the amount of Ether to send along with the call. The outcome of this call, including whether it succeeds and what data it returns (captured in `returndata`), can be influenced by the amount of Ether sent. If the target contract's behavior changes based on the Ether received, it could affect the contents of `returndata`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `returndata` and `value`.
