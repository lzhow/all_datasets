Label: no

Reason: In the given Solidity code, the variable `slot` in the function `getAddressSlot` and the variable `slot` in the function `getBooleanSlot` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. Each function creates a separate and independent `AddressSlot` or `BooleanSlot` struct that uses its own `slot` parameter to set the storage slot for that particular struct instance. There is no data dependency between the two `slot` variables because they are used independently within their own function scopes to refer to different storage slots. Data dependency would imply that the value of one variable affects the other, which is not the case here. Each function call operates in isolation with its own inputs and does not share state with other function calls.
