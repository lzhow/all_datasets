In the given code, the `getProxyImplentation` function is a public function that takes a `TransparantUpgradableproxy proxy` as an argument. This function calls the staticcall method on the proxy contract to get the implementation address.
Since the getproxyimplementation function does not modify the state of the contract, and it only reads the value of proxy variable, which is passed as a parameter, therefore the 'proxy' variable is read-only and not modifiable by any user, hence the answer is No.
