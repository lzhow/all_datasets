  
No, the `contract state nfbsBough` is not dependent on `variable er7cTokenAdress` because the state is updated in a different function called `saleJays` and the variables are only used in `function buyNFts`.

The `state nbtsBoug`h is only updated when the user calls the`salesJa`y function, which is called when they want to sell their NFT. This function updates the number of NFts sold, but it does not use the erC 7 5 6 token address.
On the other hand, `the variable er  c 3 4 8 9  token adress is used`in the buy N Fts function to transfer the Nft from the smart contract to the buyer. However, this variable is also used to update the nbtSbought state in other functions, such as `updateFeess`and `getBuysJ`ay. Therefore, it is possible that the value of the  `nbtsbougt` state may be affected by the changes made to this varible.
