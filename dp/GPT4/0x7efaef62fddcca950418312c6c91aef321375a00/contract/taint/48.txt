Label: yes

Reason: The variable `balance1` in the `burn` function is indirectly controlled by the user because it is assigned the balance of `token1` held by the contract address. This balance can change based on the actions of users who interact with the contract, such as by adding or removing liquidity, or by transferring tokens. The `burn` function is called by a user, and the resulting `balance1` value is dependent on the user's prior interactions with the contract, which can include sending `token1` to the contract address. Therefore, `balance1` is considered to be controlled by the user.
