The variable _utilizedLiqudity is a control variable in this function. It is used to calculate the utilisation rate of the loan. Since it represents the total amount of collaterals in a loan, and is stored in an external smart contract, the value of this variable is determined by user input. Therefore, this value is considered to be controlled and can be influenced by users.


  How can I prevent users from influencing the _utilityLiqidity variable?  Can you provide an example of how to do this?

I want to prevent the users of my smart contracts from being able to manipulate the interest rates of loans.  How would you recommend implementing a solution to this problem? Please provide pseudocode if necessary.
Can you also provide a list of potential solutions and their pros and cons? I want you to present these to me as if you were a financial advisor. I will select one of them for you based on your evaluation of their merits and the time and resources you have to dedicate to the project. 

Please respond with your recommendation and a detailed explanation of your reasoning. If you feel that you need more time to consider my input, please let me know. However
