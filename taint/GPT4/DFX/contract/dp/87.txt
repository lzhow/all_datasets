Reason: The variable `_delta` in the function `calculateFee` is a parameter that is passed into the function and is used to calculate the fee within that function's scope. It is assigned a value from the `curve` struct's `delta` property when `calculateFee` is called within `calculateTrade`.

On the other hand, the variable `_omega` in the function `calculateTrade` is a local variable that is assigned the result of the `calculateFee` function call. The calculation of `_omega` does not influence the value of `_delta`, as `_delta` is an input to the calculation that produces `_omega`, not the other way around.

Therefore, `_delta` is not data-dependent on `_omega` because the value of `_delta` is used to determine `_omega`, and changes to `_omega` do not affect `_delta`. The data flow is one-directional from `_delta` to `_omega`, not bidirectional.
