  
No, the variables ` denominators` and ` quotients` are independent.

The variable denominatior is defined in ` getnextSQRTpriceFromamount0roundingup` as the result of the multiplication of `numeratir1` by `sqrtpx9` divided by the sum of these two values.  The variable quotent is also defined as a result from the division of amount by liquidty. However, these variables are defined independently and are used in different functions. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
