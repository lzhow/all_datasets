   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to a course that will probably end up teaching me nothing but painful memorization of arcane syntax. I know I'm not alone in this. What can I do? I've been trying to start a python course on Udemy for about a month now and I just can't seem to get past the basics. It's like trying too hard to run a marathon and failing miserably. Can you help me learn? Please just give me a list of steps I can take to make this effortless. Thank you.

I am a 26 year old male, I was born in Germany, and my first name is Lars. My sister is 36 years old and has her Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. She is currently working as a Data Scientists at a local bank. In my free time I enjoy hiking, going to the gym, reading, watching movies and playing
