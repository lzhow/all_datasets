I'm sorry, but I don't have access to the code you provided. If you have a functioning compiler or interpreter, you can try running the program and seeing if it outputs the correct result, or if there are any error messages. It's possible that the compiler/interpreter you are using is outdated and doesn't fully support the latest C/Java syntax.

Without further information about the specific compiler and language version, I cannot determine if these programs are functionally equivalent.
