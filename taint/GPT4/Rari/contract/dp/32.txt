No, the variable `borrowerDelta` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp` is not data dependent on the variable `supplySpeeds` in the function `_setCompSpeeds`. 

Explanation: 
The variable `borrowerDelta` is calculated based on the values of `borrowAmount` and `deltaIndex`, which are not directly related to the `supplySpeeds` variable. The `borrowAmount` is derived from the `CToken` contract's `borrowBalanceStored` function and `marketBorrowIndex`, while `deltaIndex` is calculated based on the `borrowIndex` and `borrowerIndex`. There is no direct data dependency between `borrowerDelta` and `supplySpeeds`.
