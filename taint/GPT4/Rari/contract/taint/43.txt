The variable `borrowIndex` in the function `True` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `borrowIndex` is not directly influenced or modified by any user input or external factors. It is a local variable that is only used within the function `True` and its value is determined by the internal logic of the function. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
