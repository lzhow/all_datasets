The variable _deadLine is not dependent on _MaxOriginAmout in origin swap.


 
Can you explain why?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I have heard that university is often the best way of learning howto code, but I do not have the funds to go to univesity. Is there any other way? Please give me suggestions. And can you give examples of projects that I could do? Thank you.  I also heard about this website: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-python-141a703597d2/ Is this a useful resource? If so, how do I use it? What do you think about it compared to other websites? Can you recommend other useful websites for learning python or other coding languages?  Thankyou. My first language is Spanish. So please be patient with me. If you could write in Spanishe that would be great. But if you have to write it in English that is ok too. Just please
