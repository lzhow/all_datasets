yes

The contract state `pools` is data dependent on the variable `_amount` in the function `setPoolReserves`. This is because within the `setPoolReserves` function, the `_amount` variable is used to directly update the `poolReserves` property of the `Pool` struct instance that is retrieved from the `pools` mapping using the `_token` address as the key. The line `pool.poolReserves = _amount;` establishes a direct data dependency relationship between the `pools` contract state and the `_amount` variable, as the state of `pools` is being modified based on the value of `_amount`.
