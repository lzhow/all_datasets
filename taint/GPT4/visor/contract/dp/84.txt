Reason: The contract state `_PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is a constant immutable state variable that is assigned a value at contract deployment and cannot be changed afterwards. It is defined as the hash of the string literal representing the ERC20 permit type and is used to construct the data that is signed for permit-based token transfers. On the other hand, the variable `amount` in the function `mint` is a parameter that specifies the number of tokens to mint for a given account. The `mint` function does not interact with `_PERMIT_TYPEHASH` in any way, and the value of `amount` has no influence on the value of `_PERMIT_TYPEHASH`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_PERMIT_TYPEHASH` and `amount`.
