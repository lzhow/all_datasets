  
No, the ` liquid` variable in mint function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameters of the minting function.

The `m int` function takes two parameters, `amount  ` and `to`, and it calculates the liquidty based  on these parameters.  The liquid variable is a calculated value that represents the amount of liquid tokens that will be minted based the the current reserves and the total supply of tokens. It is derived from the balance of token  and total  supply. Therefore,  the value of `liq` is determined by  external factors and is therefore not under the control of  user input.
