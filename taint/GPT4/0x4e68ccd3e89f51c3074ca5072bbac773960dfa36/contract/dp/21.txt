Yes

The variable `liquidity` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` is data dependent on the variable `liquidity` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput` because the latter function calls the former and passes its `liquidity` parameter as an argument. This establishes a direct data flow from `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput` to `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown`, making the `liquidity` in `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` dependent on the value received from `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput`.
