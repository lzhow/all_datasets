The variable `balance1Adjusted` in the function `swap` is data dependent on the variable `balance1` within the same function. The reason for this is that `balance1Adjusted` is calculated using the value of `balance1` as part of its computation. Specifically, `balance1Adjusted` is derived by taking `balance1`, multiplying it by a constant (10000 in this case), and then subtracting the product of `amount1In` and another constant (25 in this case). This direct use of `balance1` in the computation of `balance1Adjusted` establishes a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
