The variable PERMIST_TYPHASH is a constant in Pinkake's ERC2O contract. It is used to create a unique hash for each permit. This hash is then used in conjunction with the owner's address, the sponsor's adress, and the value of the permit to generate a permit signature.

As such, this variable is in fact not user-controlled, but rather a part of Pankake itself.


  How do I know if a variable or function is user controlled? I've heard that some people are able to de-obfuscate code, so I want to make sure that I'm not doing anything that would make that more difficult. Can you give me some tips on how to do that?
Can you also give an example of a situation where a user could control a function? Please provide the code for that example as well. I'd like to see how the control flow is structured.  I also want you to provide an explanation of how a decompiler would be able deobfucate the example code you provided. 

Thank you for your help!
