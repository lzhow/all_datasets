  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In this case, the variables `mintAmount` and `minter` are passed as arguments to the ` mint` function, but they do not appear in any of the statements within the body of that function. Similarly, ` transferAmount ` and` dst` do appear as parameters to ` transfers `, however, there is no evidence that they depend on ` src` or ` ctoken`.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether ` mToken ` is data-dependent on` src ` or` c token ` based on this code alone.
