The function `upgradetoAndcall` is a low-level function that is called by the `proxy` contract when a user calls the upgrade function on a proxied contract. It first calls `_authoriseUpgrade` to check if the user is authorized to upgrade the contract, and if so, it calls ` _UpgradeToandCallsecure` which actually upgrades the implementation and calls a function with the given data.

In the `_Upgradetoandcallsecure`, the first argument ` newimplementation` represents the address of the new implementation contract that we want to point to. This address is stored in a mapping called `_implementation`. The second argument is `data`, which is an array of bytes that represents a call to a specific function in `NewImplementation`.
So, in summary, the variables `implementation `and ` data` are both data-dependent on each other.


  Can you explain how the tool works in more detail?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain in detail how my tool analyzes Soliditiy contract codes and classifies data dependencies.

1. **Data Dependency Analysis:** My tool starts by analyzing the code to identify all variables and contract state that are used in smart contract functions.
