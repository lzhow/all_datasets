Reason: The variable `data` in the function `upgradeAndCall` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function can be invoked by any user who has access to call it (in this case, it is restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier, meaning only the owner can call it), the `data` that is passed to the function is controlled by the user who invokes the function. In the context of smart contracts, "user" often refers to the external account or contract that interacts with the function. Since the owner is a user in this context, the `data` variable is indeed controlled by the user (the owner).
