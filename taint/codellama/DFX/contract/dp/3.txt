The variable deposit_ is not dependent on _ quoteWeight because the _ oGLiqu is checked to be zero. If it is zero, the deposited amount is calculated using the weights of the assets and the total supply of shells. However, if _ ogLique is non-zero, then the amount of deposite is calulated using a different formula that does not involve _ quotewight. Therefore, there is no data dependence between deposites_ and _quotewheight.
