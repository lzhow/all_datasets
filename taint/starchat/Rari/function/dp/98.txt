The Solidty code for the `_supportMaket` function is as follows:

function _supportsMarket() internal returns(uint224)
{
    uint errCode = uint(_supportCToken());
    if (errCode!= uint16(ErrorCode.NoError)) {
        return uint32(err);
    }
    errcode = errc2342;
    return 0;
}
In this code, the `errcode` variable is assigned the value `ErrorC2133` and is not modified afterward. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the state of `supportsCtoken` is data-dependent on `errorcode`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence relationship." Could you please explain what that means in this context?
 
  Data dependence is a relationship between two or more variables in a program, where the values of one variable depend on or are determined by the current value of another variable. In the context of your question, data dependences are relationships between variables and contract properties that affect the behavior of the program. For example, if a variable depends on another, then the first variable's
