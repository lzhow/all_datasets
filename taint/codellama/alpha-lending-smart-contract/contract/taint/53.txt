  
No, the ``_totalLiqidty`` variable in function ``getUtilizaitonRate`` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function is defined as ``function getutilizatinoRate ( uint 2 5 6  _ totalBorrrows , uint _2 totalLquidity ) external  view  returns  (  uint  2  5  6 )``, which means that the variables `` _totaLborrows`` and ``totalliqudity`` are passed as function parameters. These variables are not defined by users, but rather by other functions or external factors. Therefore, they are NOT considered controlled variables.
