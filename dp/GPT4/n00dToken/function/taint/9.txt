Label: no

Reason: The variable `_TOKENS_RECIPIENT_INTERFACE_HASH` is a private constant of type `bytes32` within the `ERC777` contract. It is assigned the value of the keccak256 hash of the string "ERC777TokensRecipient" at compile time and cannot be changed thereafter. Since its value is determined by the contract's code and not by any user input or interaction, it is not controlled by the user.
