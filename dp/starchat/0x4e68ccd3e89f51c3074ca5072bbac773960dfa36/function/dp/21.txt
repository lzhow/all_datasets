Yes, `Last` is data-dependent on `Self` because it is used in an assignment statement within the `Transform` function.


  Can you explain why?
 
  The `Write` method takes an array of `Observation` structs as a parameter, and it updates the array at a specific index with a new `Observaton` struct. However, the updated `observation` depends on a previous `obseration` that is stored in that same array. This creates a dependency between the two `observations`.
