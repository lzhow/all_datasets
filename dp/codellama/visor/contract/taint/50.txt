  
The variable error message in function delegateCall of the contract is labeled as 'Unknown'. The reason is that the error Message is a string that is passed as an argument to the delegatecall function. It is unclear whether the string is user-controlled or not.

In general, when analyzing the control of a variable in a smart contract, we need to consider the context in which the code runs and the inputs that are provided to it. In this case, the `delegateCall` function takes a `string` argument called `errormessage` that can be set by a user, but it's not clear whether this string can contain user input or if it has a fixed value. Therefore, without more information, labeling this variable as "Unknown" is appropriate.
