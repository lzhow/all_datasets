  
No, the `string` type contract variable `symbol` is not dependent on any other variable in this function.

The `pan` function is a public function that takes in two `uint` variables, `amountOut` and `reserves`, and returns a `bool` value. This function uses the `_swap` internal function to perform the actual swap operation.  The `_mints` are internal functions that are used to mint new tokens and update the total supply. These functions are called by the public `mnt` functions.   The `burn` public functions burns the tokens by calling the internal `_burns`  function and updating the balance of the token holders.
