  
The variable 'success' in function '_verifycallResult' is labeled as 'Unknown'. The reason is that the value of 'sucess' depends on the result of the call made by function 'target. call' or ' target . delegatecall'. These functions are not explicitly controlled  by user input. Therefore, the control of variable success is unknown.
