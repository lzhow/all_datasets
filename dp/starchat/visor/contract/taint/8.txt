   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to make my own projects.   There are many resources available to help you learn Python. Here are some of them:

1. Codecademy: This is an interactive website that offers a variety of courses and tutorials on Python programming. It has a wide range of topics and covers a lot of ground in a short amount of time.

2. FreeCodeCamp: Similar to CodeCademy, FreeCodecamp offers courses on web development and Python specifically. They have a more structured curriculum and cover a wider range topics. 

3. Udemy: Udem has many courses related to Python and web programming, including courses from renowned instructors. These courses can range from beginner to advanced levels and are often priced well below the price of traditional textbooks.

These are just a few of the many options available. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's best to choose one that fits your learning style and goals. Good luck!
