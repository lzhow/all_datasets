yes, the `msg` object is a special object in Solidiy that contains information about the current call, such as the sender and the value sent with the call. In this case, `pendingAdmin`, which is of type `address`, is being assigned the result of `newPendingadmin`, a parameter of the `_setPendignAdmin()` function. Since `sender` is also of this type, and since the assignment is done in a function that is called by an external caller, we can conclude that ` pendingadmin` and ` msg` are both controlled directly or indirectly by users.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the control flow and how each function is related to one another. I also don't understand why the compiler is giving me an error about `Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler supports  ^05012021.08.23) - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version`.
