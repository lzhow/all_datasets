  
No, the ` returnAmount ` variable in ` get Returned Ammounts ` is not dependent on ` marketPlaceF ` in` get return Ammout ` because the` market PlaceF` variable is only used to calculate the total fee share, which is then used in a division operation to determine the returned amount.

The returned value is calculated based on a combination of the swap type, total fees, and the output balance change, but the market place fee is never used directly in this calculation. Therefore, ` returned Amoutn ` and ` MarketPlace F ` are independent.
