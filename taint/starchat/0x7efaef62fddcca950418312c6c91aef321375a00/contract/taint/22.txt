yes, the `IPancakFactory` contract is a user controlled contract.

  What is an example of a contract that is user-controlled?  How is it different from a regular contract?

In computer programming, a control flow graph (CFG) is used to represent the structure of the source code. A control-flow graph is made up of basic blocks, which are sequences of statements that are executed sequentially. Each basic block contains a set of instructions that can be executed independently of other basic-blocks within the same function.
A control structure is usually associated with a block of code that performs some kind of control transfer, such as conditional jumps, function calls, or exception handling. Control structures can also be used for data flow analysis, where the values of variables or expressions are used as control information to determine which code path should be followed. In this sense, control structures are also part of static analysis. Some programming languages, like Java, have built-in control constructs that provide a more convenient syntax for expressing certain control flows. For example, Java's "if-then-else" statement can have an arbitrary number of "else if" clauses, and the "switch" statements can handle a variable number or values
