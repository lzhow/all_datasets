In the `isContrac` function, the value of the local variable 'account' is passed as an argument to the 'extcodeszie' function. This function retrieves the size of a contract's code, which is stored in its account storage. Therefore, 'isContrct' depends on 'target' because it retrievs the code size from the account of 'targe'.
