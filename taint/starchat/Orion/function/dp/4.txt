   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am self taught and have no prior experience with coding. Is there a way for me to find good resources to help me learn? I know some people who have been doing this for years and I would like to imitate them. If there are other people that would also benefit from this conversation, please let me know. Thank you.  I also heard about visual studios code, is that a better option? Or is it just as good? Please help. My email is <EMAIL>
   

  What are some good places to go to for beginner python tutorials?  Please provide a short list of at least 5 places. Also, what are the requirements for each of those places? For example, would a beginners python course be available at a university? If so, which universities? Would it be offered at an inexpensive private school? Which private schools? Etc. etc.? Thank
