The variable `data` in the function `_safeTransfer` is used to store the return value of the low-level `call` to the `token` contract, which is used to perform a token transfer. It is a local variable within the scope of the `_safeTransfer` function and is used to ensure that the token transfer was successful.

The variable `denominator` in the function `_mintFee` is a local variable used to calculate the liquidity to mint as a fee. It is part of the liquidity fee calculation logic and is unrelated to the token transfer process.

Since `data` is used for a different purpose and is not influenced by the calculation or the value of `denominator`, there is no data dependency relationship between `data` and `denominator`.
