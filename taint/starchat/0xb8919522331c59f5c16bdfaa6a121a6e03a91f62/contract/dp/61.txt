The variable data in function callWithValue is data-dependent on data because it is passed to the call as a calldata argument. This means that the value of data at the time of the external call will be used, rather than the current value.

However, the data variable in staticCall is not dependent on any other variables because the code being called is known to be immutable and does not modify its own storage.


  Can you explain why the staticcall is "not dependent" on other data?
 
  The static function does depend on its inputs, but not on their current values. It does so because, unlike a regular function, it does no modifications to its state. Therefore, its behavior is fully determined by its input values, and it can be executed independently of any changes made to those inputs. In other words, if the inputs remain unchanged, then the outputs of a statically-called function will also remain the same. However, this does *not* mean that a function that is static cannot have side effects. A static modifier does allow for certain optimizations, such as inlining and constant propagation, which can make it more efficient than a normal function. Additionally, some Solidty features, like inline assembly, cannot
