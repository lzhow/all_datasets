  
No, the variables `_implentation` and `_pools` are independent.

The variable `strategCandiate` is a struct that contains two fields: `implementation`, which is set in ` proposeStrategy`, and ` proposed time`,  which  is initialized to `block. timestamp` when ` proposesStrategy`is called.  The `depost` function uses the `balanc`e of the strategy contract to calculate the amount of tokens to deposite, and it does not depend on ` _implmentation`.
