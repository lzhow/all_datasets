Yes, they're semantic equivalent. C and Java are both high-level programming languages that have features such as automatic memory management, garbage collection, and type checking. While the code might contain subtle differences in how variables are declared, initialized, updated, used, etc., they ultimately perform the exact same operations and produce the identical output.
