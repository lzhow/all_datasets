  
The variable _ owner in this function is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the _Owner variable is set to the address of the message sender in line 10 of this code. This means that it can be controlled or changed by any user who calls the constructor function.

In addition, the onlyOwne function in lines 20-22 of code requires that only the current owner can call it. Therefore, only a user with the role of owner, which is determined by _ Owner, can change the value of _Ower.
