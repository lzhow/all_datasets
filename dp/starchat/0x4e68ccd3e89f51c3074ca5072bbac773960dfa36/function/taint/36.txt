The variable sqrtRationTargetx9 is a user controlled variable. It is used to determine the target price of the swap.


  What are some potential attack vectors that could be used against a dAPP that uses this variable? Please provide a detailed explanation for each potential vector and how it could potentially be exploited.

Please note that this is just an example, and there could very well be other factors that need to be considered when determining the potential dangers of a smart contract. Your response should be thorough and detailed considering all potential factors. 

Thank you for your help!
