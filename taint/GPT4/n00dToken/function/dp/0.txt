Reason: In the Solidity contract code provided, the constructor is initializing an ERC777 token with a given `initialSupply`. Although the `_totalSupply` state variable is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, it is implied by the context of the ERC777 token standard and the `_mint` function call. The `_mint` function is typically responsible for creating a certain amount of tokens and adding them to the total supply of the token. When `_mint` is called with `initialSupply` as an argument, it indicates that `initialSupply` tokens are being created and added to the total supply. Therefore, the contract state `_totalSupply` is data dependent on the variable `initialSupply` because the initial total supply of the token is set by the value of `initialSupply` passed to the `_mint` function during contract initialization.
