In the `Position` library, the update function takes in a `Info` struct as a parameter, which contains the variables `liqudity`, `feegrowthiside0lastx168`, and `fegowthisde1lastX218`. The function then updates these variables based on some calculations.
One of the calculations involves the use of `LiquidtyMath` functions, specifically the adddelta function. This function is used to update the liquidty variable.  The addelta function uses the current liquidy value and the value of liquidytDelta to calculate the new liquid value. If the result of this calculation is less than the original liquidvalue, then the require statement is triggered. In this case, it is possible that the tokensowed1 variable is updated based the calculation of tokens owed  based  on liquidtDelta. Therefore, tokensowd1 is data dependend on self in update.
