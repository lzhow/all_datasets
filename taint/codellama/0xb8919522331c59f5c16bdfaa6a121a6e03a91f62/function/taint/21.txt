In the `upgrateTo` function, the parameter `newImplentation` is passed by value, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user who calls the contract.
Similarly, in ` upgradeTAndCAll`function, ` newImplmentation` parameter is also passed as a value. Therefore, both ` data` and `  newImpementation ` are controlled  by user in this function.
