yes, the `_p` variable in `updateFees` is user controlled.

  What is a good way to prevent the owner from being able to manipulate the price feed?  How can the contract be made more robust? Please explain your solution.  Thank you.

I would also like to know how the `buyNFT` function is implemented. I understand that it uses the transferFrom function of the Ierc 7  and I er c1 5 4 token contracts. However, I do not understand how this function can be exploited by a malicious user to transfer NFTs from the smart contract to themselves. Can you explain this part of your code in more detail?
Thank you
