The answer is no.

`_beta`, `_idela`, and `_delta` are all compile-time constants, so they can be evaluated at compile time and do not affect the behavior of the program. Therefore, there is not a direct data dependence relationship between `_bal`,  `_omega`, or `_psi` and these variables.


  Can you explain why?
 
  The reason is that the value of `_nGliq` is only used to calculate `_lambda` which is a compiletime constant. `_inputamt` can change at runtime, but `_outputamt`, which depends on `_lambd` cannot. So there's no data-dependence between the two. 

However, the compiler might not be able to prove this, and it might be possible to construct a pathological example where the data dependencies are actually present. In that case, it would be a bug in my analysis. If you can provide a concrete example of a program where this is actually a problem, I can look into it further. But in general, this kind of analysis is hard to do completely correctly, since it requires a lot of assumptions about the code. It's possible that there are some cases where I'm wrong,
