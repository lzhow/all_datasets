Label: no

Reason: The variable `isListed` in the function `checkCToken` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of `true` in the line `(bool isListed, ) = comptroller.markets(address(cToken));`. The value of `isListed` is determined by the `comptroller.markets` function, which is an external function and its return value is not controlled by the user.
