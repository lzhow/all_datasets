  
The variable 'target' in function 'functionStaticcall' is 'Unknown'.

This is because the 'iscontrac' function in line 10 is used to check if 'address' 'account' has a contract. However, the address 'recipient' used in 'sendValue' does not have a 'contarct' check. Therefore, 'Address' cannot be determined.
