The contract variable `collateralsManagers` is an array of addresses. It is not a contract-state variable.

However, the array elements are contract addresses that implement the `ICollaterlaManager` interface. This interface has a function called `isManager`. This function takes a single address as an argument and returns a bool. If the address is in `colleteralManagers`, then the bool is true.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the error code `5c` (Address Conflict) is data-dependent on a variable called `_collatralManager`, not `_operator`.
Can you please explain why the `_iscolleralManager[]` array is a state variable and not an internal variable?
