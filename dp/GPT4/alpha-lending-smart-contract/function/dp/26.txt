Label: yes

Reason: The variable `totalAmount` is data dependent on the variable `_fromBlock` because the value of `totalAmount` is calculated within a while loop that iterates based on the range between `fromBlock` and `toBlock`. The variable `fromBlock` is directly assigned a value based on `_fromBlock` (either `_fromBlock` itself if it's greater than `startBlock`, or `startBlock` if not). Since `fromBlock` influences the number of iterations in the while loop and the calculations within it, any changes to `_fromBlock` will affect the value of `totalAmount`. Therefore, `totalAmount` is data dependent on `_fromBlock`.
