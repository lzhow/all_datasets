The variable `node` in the function `isWhitelisted` is data dependent on the variable `index` in the same function. 

Reason: The value of the variable `node` is computed by hashing the concatenation of `index`, `account`, and `amount` using the `keccak256` function. Since `index` is one of the inputs used in the computation of `node`, any change in the value of `index` will result in a different value for `node`. Therefore, `node` is data dependent on `index`.
