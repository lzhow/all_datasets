  
No, the `` variable in function ``_setpendingadmin`` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ``msg`` variable is a special variable that contains information about the current message, such as the sender and the data. In this case, `` msg`` contains the address of the caller, which is set by Solidiy automatically. Therefore, this variable cannot be controlled directly by a user, but rather by other contracts or external actors.
