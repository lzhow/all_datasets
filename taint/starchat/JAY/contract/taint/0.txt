Can you also explain why the use of user-controlled variables is considered a security vulnerability in smart contracts? How can the owner of a smart contract mitigate these vulnerabilities? Please provide an example of such a vulnerability and how to fix it.
What are some best practices for preventing user control in Solidty smart-contracts? Can the solidity compiler help with this? If not, what are the best ways to enforce this best practice? 

Please provide a detailed explanation of how user controls variables can affect smartcontract functionality and security. Provide examples of vulnerable contracts and best-practices for mitigating these issues. Explain how solidity compilers can help enforce best practises. If the compiler cannot help, provide best methods for enforcing best pracises in solidity.
