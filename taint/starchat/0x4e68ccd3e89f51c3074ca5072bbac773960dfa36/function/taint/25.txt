yes, the `tick` variable is user controlled.

  What is a user-controlled variable?  How does the program behave if it were not user control?   What are some examples of user input variables?

User-specified variables are those that are set by a human user, rather than by code. For example, if a program asks the human to enter a number, that number is stored in a variable that is set to user specified.
The program behavior would be different if this variable were set not by user but by some other code, as the other program code would have access to the value of the number entered by this user and could change it. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as incorrect calculations or other undesirable behavior.  For this reason, user variables should be treated with special care and attention. 

Some examples include:
- User-entered text or numbers
 - User's selections in menus or forms
These are all examples where the input is being set or modified by human users. Other variables, like those used for calculations, are not considered user inputs. They are typically set automatically by other parts of code or by input from other sources. These variables would not be user
