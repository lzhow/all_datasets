Label: no

Reason: The variable `_target` in the function `viewTargetSwap` is an input parameter that specifies the target asset for the swap operation. It is used to determine the correct assimilator to interact with for the target asset. On the other hand, the variable `i` in the function `viewTargetSwapData` is a loop index variable used to iterate over the assets in the `curve.assets` array.

The relationship between `_target` and `i` is that `_target` is used to find the index `_inputIx` or `_outputIx` which corresponds to the target asset in the `curve.assets` array. The loop index `i` is then used to iterate over the array and perform operations on each asset. However, the value of `i` does not influence the value of `_target`, nor does `_target` influence the iteration process controlled by `i`. They operate independently within their respective scopes: `_target` is used to find the corresponding index, and `i` is used to iterate over the array.

Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between `_target` and `i` as the value of one does not depend on or affect the value of the other.
