Explanation:
In the first function, the `if` statement checks if the asset address is equal to the zero address. If it is, then the result is calculated using the amount and 1 Ether. However, if it's not, it calls the I ERC 2 0 simple contract and gets the decimation value. Then, result will be calculated by multiplying the  amount by 8 and dividing it by the number of decims.
Therefore, in both cases, ` result` is data-dependent on ` amount`.
