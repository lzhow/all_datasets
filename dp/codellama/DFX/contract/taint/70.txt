  
No, the ` i` variable in function `getFoe` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it has a fixed value.

The `for` loop in ` getFees` function iterates over the array `_bales` and assigns each element to the local ` _ bal`variable.  The `ix` property of the `_numraire` object is also assigned a value, but it does not affect the value of `I`.
