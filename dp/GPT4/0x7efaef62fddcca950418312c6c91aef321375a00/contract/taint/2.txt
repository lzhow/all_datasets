Reason: The variable `_kLast` in the function `_mintFee` is a private state variable of the `PancakePair` contract. It is not directly set by the user but is calculated and updated by the contract's internal logic during the execution of the `mint` and `burn` functions. The value of `_kLast` is determined by the reserves of the liquidity pool and the liquidity provided or removed. While users can influence the reserves by adding or removing liquidity, they do not have direct control over the `_kLast` variable itself. It is the contract's internal mechanisms that update this variable based on the state of the reserves after each liquidity event.
