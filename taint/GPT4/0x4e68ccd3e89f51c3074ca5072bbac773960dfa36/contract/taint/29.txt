Explanation: The variable `l` in the function `binarySearch` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is initialized with the value `(index + 1) % cardinality` and then updated within the while loop based on certain conditions. The value of `l` is determined solely by the program logic and does not depend on any user input. Therefore, it is classified as not controlled by the user.
