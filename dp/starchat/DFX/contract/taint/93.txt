The variable "amt_" in function "intateRaw" is a signed 16-bit integer, which can be represented in Solidty as an "inte118" type. This type is used to store integer values that can range from -2^15 to 2^(1024-1).

However, the value of "amount_" is assigned to the "uint192" variable, and the ".abs()" method is applied to "amout_" to convert it to an unsigned integer. Therefore, "aamt_t" may be negative, but it will be converted to a positive integer by using the absolute value.
So, in summary, yes, variable 'amt_' in 'intaateRraw' is controled by user, because it can store a negative value and convert a negavtive value to positive value by applying the '.abs()' method.
