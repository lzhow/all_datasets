yes

The contract state `protocolFees` is data dependent on the variable `feeProtocol0` in the function `flash`. This is because `feeProtocol0` is used to calculate `fees0`, which is then conditionally added to `protocolFees.token0` if `uint128(fees0) > 0`. The value of `feeProtocol0` directly influences the amount of fees that are added to `protocolFees.token0`, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
