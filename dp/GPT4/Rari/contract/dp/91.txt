Yes

The variable `deltaBlocks` in the function `updateContributorRewards` is data dependent on the variable `block.number` in the function `getBlockNumber`. The reason for this is that `deltaBlocks` is calculated using the current block number obtained from the call to `getBlockNumber()`, which returns `block.number`. The `block.number` is a global variable in Solidity that represents the current block number in the blockchain. Here's the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function updateContributorRewards(address contributor) public {
    uint compSpeed = compContributorSpeeds[contributor];
    uint blockNumber = getBlockNumber(); // getBlockNumber() returns block.number
    uint deltaBlocks = sub_(blockNumber, lastContributorBlock[contributor]); // deltaBlocks depends on blockNumber
    // ...
}

function getBlockNumber() public view returns (uint) {
    return block.number; // This is where block.number is returned
}
```

As you can see, `deltaBlocks` is calculated by subtracting `lastContributorBlock[contributor]` from `blockNumber`, which is directly obtained from the `getBlockNumber()` function that returns the `block.number`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `deltaBlocks` and `block.number`.
