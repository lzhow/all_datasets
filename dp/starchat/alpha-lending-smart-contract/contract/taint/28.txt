   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bunding together the various components of a web project into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This allows for faster page loads and reduces the number of requests made to a server, which can significantly improve the overall performance and user experience.

When you build a project using an incremental bundle tool, the tool analyzes the dependencies between the different components in your project and generates a graph that represents the relationships between them. Then, using this graph,the tool can optimize how the components are bundled together, by ensuring that components that are used together are placed in a same bundle, and that any shared dependencies are only included once. Additionally, tools like Webpack can automatically optimize and bundle the project
