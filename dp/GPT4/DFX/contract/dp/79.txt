Reason: The variable `_deposit` in the function `depositWithWhitelist` is an argument that represents the amount to be deposited by the caller of the function. It is used to calculate the proportional deposit and minting of new tokens within the `ProportionalLiquidity.proportionalDeposit` function call.

On the other hand, the variable `_sender` in the function `transferFrom` is an argument that represents the address from which tokens are being transferred. It is used to identify the source account in a token transfer operation and to adjust the balances and allowances accordingly within the `_transfer` and `_approve` internal function calls.

There is no direct data dependency between `_deposit` and `_sender` because they are used in different contexts and for different purposes within the contract. `_deposit` is related to the depositing of funds and minting of new tokens, while `_sender` is related to the transfer of existing tokens between accounts. They operate independently of each other and do not influence one another's values or behavior within the contract's logic.
