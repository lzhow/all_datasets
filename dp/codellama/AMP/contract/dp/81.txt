  
No, the variables `_addValue ` and `_ operator` are independent.

The function `increaseAllowances` takes in a parameter `_value` which is added to the current allowances of the `_spenders` for the token holder. This means that the value of `_allowedbyPartion` is modified, but the original value is not used in any way. Therefore, `_ addedValue is data-dependent on `_ value`, but not on` _ operator`.
