  
No, the ` tick` variable in function `getSurgoundingObsrvations` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` getSurounding Observations ` function takes in a `int23` parameter called `ticks` which is used to calculate the cumulative tick value. This value is calculated based on the previous observation and the current observation. Therefore, this value cannot be controlled directly by a user, but rather it depends on other factors such as the liquidty and time.
