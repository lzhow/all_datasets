  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `_total_supply` variable is updated by adding the ` amount` value to it. This means that the value of `_ total_ supply` is dependent on `Amount`.
Similarly, `_ balances [account]` is also updated in this function by using the same `add` function as `_ _ totalSuppy`. This implies that `_ balance [Account]` also depends on `_amount`. Therefore, both `_TotalSupplies` and `_Balances_[Accounts]` are dependent variables.
