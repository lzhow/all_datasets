   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it. I want to do something useful with it that pays the bills. What should I do? I have heard that the best way is to just start using python, find something you enjoy, make a lot of mistakes, ask for help when you need it, keep learning, never stop learning. Is that a bad advice? Should I be worried? How do I know if I'm learning anything useful? What if it's all useless and I waste my time? Is there anything else I could do to make sure I learn something that will actually help me in my future as a python developer? Please help. This is very important to me. Thank you.  I also heard the saying "practice makes a man perfect". Can you
