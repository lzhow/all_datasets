yes, the `uint wehBalance...` variable is user controlled.


  Can you explain why? What is it used for?

I'm trying to understand the code, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how the withdraw function works. I see that it's calling `IWETHPair.withdraw`, but it doesn't look like that function exists.
Can you help me understand how this works? I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!
