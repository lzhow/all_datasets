The variable self in function `observeSingle` is a reference to an array of `Observation` structs, which is stored on the blockchain. Since the array is dynamically allocated on chain, and the length of the struct is unknown, the size of self is also unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine whether or not self can be considered "controlled by user".


  Can you explain how I can determine if a variable is user controlled?  I know that I am not allowed to look at the code, but I would like to know if there is some way to determine this.





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I'm five.  Also, what is its relationship to Vite? Expound upon these topics as much as possible. I'd love to learn more about these technologies. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can then be served to the end user's browser. This makes it easier for the browser to load the application and makes the overall performance of your application better.
