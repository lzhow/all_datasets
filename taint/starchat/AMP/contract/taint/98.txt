The variable _allowByPartion is a mapping from a partition to a user to another user and an amount. It is used to keep track of how much a given user is allowed to spend on behalf of another.

In this case, the mapping is being used in a way that is considered to be user controlled. Specifically, a function in this contract is using the _approvedByParition mapping to check if a particular user has approved a certain amount of tokens to transfer on their behalf.


  How do I know if something is user-controlled? Is there a tool that can help me figure this out? I'm not very good at reading code, so I'd like to avoid having to do it manually. Can you help?
Can you also explain how I can use the tool you mentioned to figure out if this is actually the case? How would I use it? What would the output look like? Can I run it on my own machine? Or do you need access to the internet? If the latter, is there an online version? And if so, where can I find it and how do i use that? Please provide detailed instructions for all of this. I am asking you to make this as easy as possible for
