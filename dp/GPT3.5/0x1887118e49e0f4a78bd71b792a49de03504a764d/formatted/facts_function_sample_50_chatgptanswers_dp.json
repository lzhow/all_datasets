You analyze the Solidity contract code and classify if two variables or contract states have a data dependency relationship. The labels you use are 'yes', 'no' and 'unknown'. 'yes' means they are data dependent. 'no' means they are not data dependent. Otherwise, they are labelled 'unknown'. You first give the label and then explain the reason. There is one example.",
            "The code is \n ```\n function add ( address[] calldata underlyings , PriceOracle[] calldata _oracles ) external onlyAdmin {        require(underlyings.length > 0 && underlyings.length == _oracles.length, \"Lengths of both arrays must be equal and greater than 0.\");        for (uint256 i = 0; i < underlyings.length; i++) {            if (!canAdminOverwrite) require(address(oracles[underlyings[i]]) == address(0), \"Admin cannot overwrite existing assignments of oracles to underlying tokens.\");            oracles[underlyings[i]] = _oracles[i];        }    }\nfunction add ( address[] calldata underlyings , PriceOracle[] calldata _oracles ) external onlyAdmin {        require(underlyings.length > 0 && underlyings.length == _oracles.length, \"Lengths of both arrays must be equal and greater than 0.\");        for (uint256 i = 0; i < underlyings.length; i++) {            if (!canAdminOverwrite) require(address(oracles[underlyings[i]]) == address(0), \"Admin cannot overwrite existing assignments of oracles to underlying tokens.\");            oracles[underlyings[i]] = _oracles[i];        }    } \n``` . \n You first give the label and then explain the reason. Please answer the following question: is the variable `i`  in the function add data depended on the variable `_oracles` in the function `add`?"

        "Label: No.\n\nReason: The variable `i` is a loop counter that iterates over the `underlyings` array. It is not related to the `_oracles` array in any way. Therefore, there is no data dependency between the two variables.\n\nRegarding the question, the variable `i` in the function `add` is not data dependent on the variable `_oracles` in the same function."
