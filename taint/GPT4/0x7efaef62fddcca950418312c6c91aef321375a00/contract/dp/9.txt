Reason: The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is used to store the result of a low-level `call` to a token contract, indicating whether the token transfer was successful. It is assigned as part of the execution of the token transfer and does not depend on any other state variables or inputs outside of the `_safeTransfer` function.

On the other hand, the variable `_totalSupply` in the function `mint` represents the total supply of the PancakePair tokens. It is used within the `mint` function to calculate the amount of liquidity tokens to mint based on the provided liquidity.

Since `success` is determined by the outcome of a token transfer operation and `_totalSupply` is related to the liquidity token calculations within the `mint` function, there is no direct data dependency between `success` and `_totalSupply`. They operate independently within their respective functions and are not used in conjunction with each other to derive new state changes.
