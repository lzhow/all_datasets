The two provided C code snippets are syntactically and semanticallt identical. The only difference between the code blocks is the value of the variable `t` is used after being overwritten by the previous value.

Both C programs will produce the correct output for any input and will thus be semanticlly equivalent. However, for simplicity the following `diff` command can be used to determine if there is a semantic difference:
```
diff -u c-code.txt mutant-c-Code.tx
Using original as c and mutated as m
0a1,6
> #include
< unsigned int t;
6a8
>> t=x; // where x is some valid integer
5c6,8c9
---
 > {
 < int x;
 	unsigned a=1;
		x=5;
			y=6*x-3;
				z=sqrt(x*y);
					float result = a+ b/c * x + y / z ; // all valid c code
+++
	// all syntatically correct c
-	return  result;
