Yes

The variable `amount` in the function `depositEth` is data dependent on the variable `amountIn` in the function `getAmountsOut`. The reason for this is that `amountIn` is used to calculate the `amountsOut` array, which is then used in the `callBytes` function to determine the amount to be deposited when calling `depositEth`. Specifically, `amountsOut[0]` is assigned the value of `amountIn` and is then passed as the `amount` argument to `depositEth` when the `inputToken` is `ETH`. This establishes a direct data dependency between `amountIn` and the `amount` used in `depositEth`.
