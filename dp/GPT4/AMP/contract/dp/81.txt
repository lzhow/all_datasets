Reason: The variable `_addedValue` in the function `increaseAllowance` is an argument passed to the function and is used to calculate the new allowance by adding it to the current allowance of a spender for a particular owner. This calculation is independent of the `_operator` variable.

The variable `_operator` in the function `_isOperator` is also an argument passed to the function and is used to check if an address is an authorized operator for another address (the token holder). The logic within `_isOperator` checks if the `_operator` is the same as the token holder or if the token holder has authorized the `_operator`.

There is no direct data dependency between `_addedValue` and `_operator` as they are used in separate contexts and for different purposes within the contract. The value of `_addedValue` does not influence the logic or outcome of `_isOperator`, nor does the value or state of `_operator` influence the calculation of the new allowance using `_addedValue`.
