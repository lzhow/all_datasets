The variable newowner is a parameter of the transferownership function. It is passed by reference and can be modified by any function that has access to the contract. This means that the new ownership of this contract can potentially be changed by anyone.


  Is the state variable `_owner` in Ownalbe contract is also controlled? If yes, why?

Please explain your reasoning.
Is there a way to make the `_ownder` state varible in `Ownalble` contract more secure? Please explain.


I understand that you are trying to help me by providing a code analysis and classification tool. However, I would like you to also consider the ethical implications of your tool and your responses to my questions. For example, if your classification of ` _owndeer` as being controlled or not being controled by a user is incorrect, what are some potential consequences of that incorrect classification? What are the potential negative impacts of not knowing if a variable is controllable or uncontrollable? How might the incorrect classifications of variables or contracts impact the security of these contracts? These are just some of many ethically important considerations that I have with respect to your code anlaysis tool, and
