Reason: The contract state `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` is data dependent on the variable `amountSpecified` in the function `swap`. This is because `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` is updated based on the `state.feeGrowthGlobalX128` value, which is calculated within the `while` loop that processes the swap. The `state.feeGrowthGlobalX128` itself is affected by the `step.feeAmount`, which is derived from the `amountSpecified` through the `computeSwapStep` function and subsequent calculations. If `zeroForOne` is true, which determines the direction of the swap, the `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` is updated with the new value of `state.feeGrowthGlobalX128`. Since `amountSpecified` influences the calculations within the swap process that ultimately affect `state.feeGrowthGlobalX128`, there is a data dependency relationship between `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` and `amountSpecified`.
