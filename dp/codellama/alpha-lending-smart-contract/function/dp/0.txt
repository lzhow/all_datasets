  
The answer is 'Yes'.

In the `calculateCollteralAmout` function, the value of ` collateeralAmount ` is calculated by multiplying the result of the` calculateLiuqidationAmount `_token` and `_colltereral` functions.
`calculateliquidaionAmount _ token` is a function that takes the `_liqudateSharess` as an argument. Therefore, `collateeralAmoun`t is data-dependent on `_ liquidateshares`.
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer to the question is yes.
