  
No, the variables `_address` and `ids` are independent.

The variable  `_tokensAddress ` is a parameter of the ` buy ER1` function, which is not dependent on any other variable in this function.  The variable` ids` is also a function parameter, and it is used to iterate over the array of token IDs in `IER1.safe TransferFrom`. However, this does not create a dependency between the two arrays. Each iteration of `safe transferFrom` uses a different token ID from the`ids `array, so the order of elements in` _tokeAddresses` does  not affect the outcome of each iteration. Therefore, there is no data dependence between`_tokesAddresss`and`idss`.
