Label: no

Reason: The variable `c` in the function `tryAdd` is a local variable that is calculated as the sum of the parameters `a` and `b` within the same function. It is not influenced by any external variables or state, and its value is determined solely by the inputs to the `tryAdd` function. On the other hand, the function `trySub` is a separate function with its own scope and local variables. There is no interaction or data flow between the variable `c` in `tryAdd` and any variables in `trySub`. Since there is no shared state or direct communication between these two functions, `c` is not data dependent on any variable in `trySub`.
