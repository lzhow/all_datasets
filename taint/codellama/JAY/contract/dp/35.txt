  
No, the ` success` variable in function  ` sell` is not dependent on ` eth` because the value of `  success ` is determined by the return values of the two internal function calls, ` msg .call ` and ` dev . call `, which are independent of each other and of  the  value  of` eth`.

The `msg .value` parameter of these function call is set to `0`, which means that the call will not transfer any Ether. Therefore, even if the internal calls fail, there will be no Ethereum transferred, and the transaction will still be successful.
