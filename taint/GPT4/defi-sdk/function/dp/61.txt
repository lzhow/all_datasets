The contract variable `_hashed_version` is not directly dependent on ` returnAmount`. The function only emits an event with the `input. tokenAmount`, `absoluteInput amount`, and `output. absoluteAmount ` as parameters.  The `hash` function is used to hash the parameters and emit the event. Therefore, the hashed version is dependent only on these parameters, not on any other variables.
