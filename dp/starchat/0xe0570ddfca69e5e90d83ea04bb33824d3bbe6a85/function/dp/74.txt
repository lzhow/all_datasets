The contract variable `_balance` is not used in this function, so it is considered not to be a dependency.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "contract state". Could you please rephrase your question?
  
  Sorry for the confusion. I meant to say that the return value of the `want().balanceof( address( this ) )` expression is dependent on a contract internal state variable named `_balances`.
