The contract function ```getTotal()``` has two return values.

- The first value is ```nftBough```, which is a state variable of the smart contract. It is not modified by the ```getTotla() ``` function. Therefore, it is data-independent of ```nftSOLD```.  Therefore the first return value of  ``` getTotlas()  is 'No'.
 - The second value, ``` nftSOld``` is also a contract variable. However, this time it depends on ```_allownces``` which was passed as an argument to the  function when it was called. Since ``` _allowences``` was also passed to ``` getTotal() as a parameter```, it means that ```  _alowances``` and ```ntsS old``` are dependent on each other. This means the second return variable is dependent of both the input and contract variables. So the answer is  'Yes'.


  Can you explain how the tool works?
 
  Sure! The tool analyzes the code to determine if the variables and states are related in a way that could affect the behavior of a smart contracts. For example, if one variable depends directly or indirectly on another variable, then
