  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `pairFor` function, the variables `factory`, `address token A`, and ` address` token B are passed as arguments.
However, in ` get AmountOut Curve`, the arguments ` factory`,`from`,and `to` are used to call the`pairfor`function.  The ` pairfor ` function returns the value of the pair variable, which is then used in`get Amountout Curv`e. Therefore, ` tokenb` is data-dependent on ` i` because it is used as an argument in a function that is called in another function.
