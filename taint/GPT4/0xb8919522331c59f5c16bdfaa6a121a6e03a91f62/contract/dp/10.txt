Label: no

Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the code size of the address `account` which is checked to determine if the address is a contract or not. This is done by using the `extcodesize` opcode in the inline assembly block. On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionCall` represents the address of the contract being called. There is no direct relationship between `size` and `target` within the scope of their respective functions. The value of `size` is determined independently of the value of `target`, and vice versa. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
