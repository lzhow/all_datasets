There is no direct data dependence between the two functions. However, there is an indirect data flow between them.
In the `_upgradetoAndcallSecur` function, the `data` parameter is passed to the`Address. functionDelegatecall` method, which is a low-level call that can execute arbitrary code. This means that the data in ` data` can be modified by the called contract, potentially including the contract address stored in`newbeacon`.
On the other hand, in `_ setBeacons`, the address of the new Beacon contract is stored directly in a storage slot, without any modification. Therefore, it is unlikely that ` forcecall ` is directly dependent on ` newbeacon`. However , it's possible that a malicious contract could modify the storage of ` _BEAON _SLot` and cause ` Forcecall to be set to true, allowing it to call the old implementation of` newimplementation`. This would create a potential security vulnerability.
