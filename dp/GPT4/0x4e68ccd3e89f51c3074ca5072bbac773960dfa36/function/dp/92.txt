The variable `tickUpper` in the function `checkTicks` is not data dependent on the variable `cardinalityNext` in the function `initialize`. The function `checkTicks` is a `private pure` function, which means it does not read or modify the state of the contract. It only operates on its input parameters and does not have access to any state variables or outputs of other functions unless those values are passed in. The variable `tickUpper` is a parameter of `checkTicks` and is only used within the scope of this function to perform checks against constants from `TickMath`.

On the other hand, `cardinalityNext` is a local variable in the `initialize` function that is derived from the `observations.initialize` function call. It is used to set the `observationCardinalityNext` field in the `slot0` state variable within the same `initialize` function.

Since `tickUpper` and `cardinalityNext` are used in different functions without any direct interaction or shared state, and there is no indication that the result of one is passed to the other, they are not data dependent.
