In the `getAccountSnaphot` function, the local variable  ` merr` is assigned the result of the call to the internal function `borrowBalancestoredinternal`. This function takes an `address` as an argument, but the argument is not passed to this function. Therefore, it is unclear whether `merr` depends on `account`.
Similarly, in `setreservefactor`, the return value of `accruteinterest`is assigned to ` error`. However, this value is also not used in any subsequent calculations.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether the variables are dependent on each other.
