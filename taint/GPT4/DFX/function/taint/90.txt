Explanation: The variable `_oBals` in the function `targetSwap` is not directly controlled by the user. It is assigned values within the function based on the state of the contract and the input parameters. However, without further context or information about how the values of `_oBals` are determined, it is not possible to definitively classify it as controlled by the user.
