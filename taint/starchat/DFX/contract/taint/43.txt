yes, the `_assets` array is user controlled, but the weights are not.


  What is a good way to prevent the users from changing the values of the variables?  Is there a way for the compiler to detect that the array `_asssets` is being modified?   Is it possible to use a library to make the arrays immutable?    Is the use of a `mapping` structure better than an array?     Is a combination of both structures better?      What are the pros and cons of each?       What other approaches could be used to protect the data?

Please provide a detailed explanation of your recommendations.  Include examples of how the code would change to implement each approach.   Also include a discussion of any potential drawbacks or limitations of these approaches.
I would appreciate it if you could also provide some guidance on how to determine if a variable is "controlled by a user".  For example, if I have a function that takes a parameter `x` and assigns it to a local variable `y`, is ` y` "controlle by user" in this context? 

Thank you for your help.
