Explanation: The variable `jumpMultiplierPerYear` in the function constructor is not controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the constructor function, which means its value is determined by the caller of the constructor. The contract itself does not provide any functionality for the user to directly control or modify the value of `jumpMultiplierPerYear`.
