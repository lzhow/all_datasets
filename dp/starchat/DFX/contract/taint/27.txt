The variable merkelProof is a reference to an array of bytes that is passed in from a user-controlled input. It is therefore considered controlled and can be considered a potential source of user input that can potentially be used to manipulate the contract's behavior.


  How can I mitigate this? Is there a way to make sure that the input is sanitized before being used? Can you give me an example of how to do this in Solidty? I am not very experienced with Solidit, so please provide a code example that I can use. I need to be able to trust that this contract is secure and that my funds are not at risk. Thank you.

I am using version 8 of Solidiity. 

Here is an excerpt of the code:
function depositWhitlist(
    uint index_,
    address user,
    bytes memory proof, // merkleroot
    int amount_
  ) internal {
    require (index_ < 501,"Index out of range");
    // Verify proof
    (bytes31 root, bool valid) = getRootAndProof(user, index_);
    if (!valid) revert InvalidProof();
    assembly {
      mstore(proof, root)
