The variable balance is a local variable in swap function. It is used to hold intermediate calculation results. Since it's not used as input to any external function or state variable, we can say that it doesn't control the state of the contract.


  How about the `reserve` variables? Are they user controlled? If not, why do you think they are user-controlled?

I'm asking because I'm writing a thesis on smart contracts and I want to make sure I understand the implications of your analysis.
Can you explain to me why you believe these variables are or are not user controllable? Please include any relevant code or comments. 

Thank you. I appreciate your help. 





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to my in an understandable manner. What are the pros and cons of using such a bundling tool? How does it work? What does the configuration file usually look like? Which loaders does Webpack support out of box? And how can I add additional loadERS? Explaining all of that in a simple way is key. If you can also compare different tools
