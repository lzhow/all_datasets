The contract function is used to authorize an operator for a specific partition.

`_authorizedOperators` is not a state variable, so it is irrelevant to whether it has a dependency on `_partition` or `_operators`.
However, `_authorizedPartitionByOperator` *is* a mapping from `_partitions` to `_operatos`, so if `_partiton` has changed, then `_authorisedPartitionbyOperator[_partition]` may have changed as well.


  Can you explain how the tool works?
 
  Sure! The tool analyzes the code to determine whether two contract variables have an explicit data-dependence relationship, as defined by the programmer. It does this by examining the control flow graph (CFG) of the program and analyzing the dependencies between variables and contract storage.

  The analysis works by first constructing a directed graph where nodes are variables (or contract fields) and edges represent data dependencies. Then, it performs a topological sort on this graph, which ensures that all data dependences are resolved before they can be used. If the graph contains a cycle, the analysis fails and the variables are marked as "unknown".

  Once the data flow dependencies have been determined, a heuristic is applied to infer whether
