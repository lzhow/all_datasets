   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to make my own programs.




I would recommend the official Python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will teach you the basics of the Python language.

If you want a more practical approach, you could start with the Codecademy Python course at: https: // www.codecademy.com/learn/python. This is an interactive course that will take you through the fundamentals of Python and help you write your own code. Additionally, there are many other resources available online, such as tutorials and forums, that can help guide you in your learning journey. Good luck!
