   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization process works in web development. Thanks!




An incremental bundlers job is to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, and other assets, into a single file that can be served to users. This makes it easier for users to download and use the application since they only have to load a small amount data instead of many small files.

When you build a project with an incremental bundle, the incremental part means that it only updates the portions of the bundle that have changed since the last build. For example, if you make a change to a JavaScript file, only the changed code will be included in subsequent builds, which can significantly reduce the build time.
