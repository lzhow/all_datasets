Label: no

Reason: The variable `bitPos` in the function `position` is calculated based on the input parameter `tick`. It is a local variable within the scope of the `position` function and is used to determine the bit position within a word. On the other hand, the variable `masked_scope_3` in the function `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord` is derived from the bitwise operation between the `self[wordPos]` mapping value and a mask that is calculated within the scope of the `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord` function. The calculation of `masked_scope_3` does not rely on the value of `bitPos` from the `position` function. Instead, it depends on the `wordPos` and `bitPos` calculated within its own scope (`nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord`), which are independent of the `bitPos` in the `position` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `bitPos` in `position` and `masked_scope_3` in `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord`.
