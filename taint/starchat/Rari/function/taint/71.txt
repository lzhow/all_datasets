The variable __ fuseadminhasrights is a private variable in CE rc2 0delegate contract. It is used to store the status of the admin rights of fuse admin contract, which is an internal contract of Comp troller contract in Unit protocol.

As per the solidity documentation, private variables are not accessible outside the contract they are declared in. Therefore, the value of this variable cannot be modified by any external party. Hence, this is considered to be a controlled variable.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at coding. I've never seen anything like this before. Can I trust you? Can we trust the smart contracts on the blockchain? What if they're malicious? How do I know they haven't been hacked? Are there any other ways I can check the contracts for errors? Please help me understand how to do this. Thank you. What is Unit? Is it a cryptocurrency? If so, what is it used for? Why do people use it? Who is its current owner? When was it created? Where is all of its code? And how do they make money? Do they have a token? Or is everything in cryptos? Does it have any competitors
