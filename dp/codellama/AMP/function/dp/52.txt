There is no direct data dependence between the variables `_from` and `_to` because they do not appear in any expression together. However, the value of `_partition` is used in both functions, which could potentially affect the behavior of the contract. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether there is a direct or indirect data relationship between `_partion`and `_operatordata`.
