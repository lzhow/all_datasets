The variable input token is a controlled variable. It is passed into the approve and call function as an argument. This means that the value of inputtoken is determined by a user input, and can be modified by that user at any time.


  How can I prevent this? I want to make sure that my users cannot modify the input. I am using hardhat and solidity. Can you give me an example of how I can do this in my code? Please include the changes that I need to do in both the solidity and hard hat files. Thank you.

I want the contract to be as secure as possible. How do I make it so that users can't modify any of the variables? Can I use modifiers to prevent users from modifying certain functions? How would I do that?
Can you provide me with a list of all the functions in this contract and whether or not they can modify state? Thankyou. 

Please provide a detailed response. Include the code changes required in solidity, hardHat, as well as a step-by-step explanation of what needs to happen to implement the measures you have suggested. If you can provide any examples of code that demonstrates how to use the modifiers, that would be even better.
