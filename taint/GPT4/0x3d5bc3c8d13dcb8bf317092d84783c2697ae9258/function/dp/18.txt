Without the complete context of the contract, it is impossible to determine whether the contract state `borrowIndex` is data dependent on the variable `error` within the function `_addReservesInternal`. The provided code snippet does not include any direct reference to `borrowIndex`, nor does it show the implementation of `accrueInterest()` or `_addReservesFresh(addAmount)`, which could potentially modify or depend on `borrowIndex`. To accurately determine the data dependency relationship, the full contract code, including the definitions of all functions and state variables, would be required.
