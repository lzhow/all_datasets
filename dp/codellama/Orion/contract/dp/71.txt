  
No, the variables ` cur Factory` and ` amount Out` are independent.

The variable  `  cur factory` is a constant that is defined in  the constructor of the contract and is not modified in any other function. Therefore, it is independent of any variable in other functions.  The variable amount out is also a local variable that only exists in function  `_ swap` . It is only used in that function and does not affect any variables outside of that scope.
