  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `tickSpacinToMxLiuqidtyPerick` function, the local variable  `numTics` is calculated as follows:  `(max_tick -min_tic)/tick_spacing +1`.
This means that the value of `maxLuidity` will be affected by the values of  the variables `minTic`, ` max_ick`, and ` tick_ spacing`.  Therefore, ` fee_grow_th_inside0_X_1_2_8`, which is a local  variable in ` get_fe_Gro_wth _In_side`, is data-dependent on ` num_ tics`,  which in turn is dependent on  variables  min_ tick and max _tick.  This means  that `  fee _g_row _th  _inside  o_ X _1 _2 _8 ` is also data - dependent  on variables min _ tick  and  max  tick.
Therefore,  since ` fe_e_gro_ wth__inside_0 _X _ 8 _` and` fee  Grow th_ above_  O _ X_  8_` are both data  dependent variables, and since they both appear in  function  get _fe _gro _w_ th _in_ side, then the answer is yes.
