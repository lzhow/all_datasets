The variable redemption is a user controlled variable.


  How do I know if a variable is user-controlled? Is there a tool that can help me with that? I'm not very experienced with Solidiy. I've heard that Solidty is considered a high-level language, but I don't know what that means. Can you explain it to me like I have five years of experience with programming? Please provide me a step-by-step explanation. Thank you.

I'm asking you this because I want to learn more about Solidit. If you could provide a list of good resources for me to read, that would be great. Also, if you have any suggestions for other programming languages I could learn, I would appreciate it. 

Thank you for your help. It is much appreciated.
