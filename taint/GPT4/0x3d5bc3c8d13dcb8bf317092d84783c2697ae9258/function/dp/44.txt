Label: no

Reason: The variable `numerator` in the function `divScalarByExp` is not data dependent on the variable `a` in the function `mulExp`. In Solidity, function scope means that variables are local to the function they are defined in. The variable `numerator` is a local variable within `divScalarByExp` and is assigned a value based on the result of the `mulUInt` function call. The variable `a` is a parameter of the function `mulExp` and is used to create a new `Exp` struct instance within that function. There is no direct relationship or data flow between `numerator` and `a` as they are local to their respective functions and there is no code showing that `divScalarByExp` is called from `mulExp` or vice versa, nor is there any shared state or parameters passed between them that would create a data dependency.
