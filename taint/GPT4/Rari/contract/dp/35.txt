No. The variable `compAccrued_` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `supplierIndex` in the function `distributeSupplierComp`. 

The reason is that there is no direct assignment or usage of `supplierIndex` in the calculation or modification of `compAccrued_` in the `updateCompSupplyIndex` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
