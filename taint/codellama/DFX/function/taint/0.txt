  
No, the `_interace` variable in function `supportInterface` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is hardcoded in Solidiy.

The function is used to check if a contract supports a specific interface, and the interface is passed as an argument to this function. However, since the value of the `interface_` parameter is a hard-coded constant, there is no way for the contract to be controlled or manipulated by a user through this parameter. Therefore, this variable is considered to not be under the control of a  user in this context.
