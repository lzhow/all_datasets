  
The label is 'No'.

In the ` functionfunctionCallwithValue` function, the` target` variable is passed as an argument to the contract call. This means that the value of ` target ` is determined by the caller of the  `  functioncallwithvalue`function.
On the other hand, in `FunctionStaticcall`, the target variable  is not passed in as a parameter. Instead, it is set to `address (this)` which is a reference to  the current contract. Therefore, `Target` is dependent on `this` and not on` data`.
Therefore, there is no data dependence between ` Target`and ` data`in the two functions.
