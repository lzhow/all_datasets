  
The variable 'self' in function 'update' is a mapping of type 'int 2 4' to 'Tic. Info' which is defined in library 'tick'. It is an internal variable and is used to store the state of the contract. It cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it does not have a setter function. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In the context of a smart contract, a variable is considered controlled if it can be modified by an external actor, such as a malicious user or a third-party contract that interacts with the current contract in an unintended way. In this case, since the ' self' variable cannot directly be accessed or modified from outside the library, and it only serves as an intermediate storage for the tick information, we can conclude that it cannot controlled.
