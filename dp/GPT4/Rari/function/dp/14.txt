Explanation: The variable `toDrip_` in the function `drip` is data dependent on the variable `b` in the function `add`. This is because the value of `toDrip_` is calculated using the `add` function, which takes `b` as one of its inputs. The result of the `add` function is then assigned to `toDrip_`, indicating a data dependency between the two variables.
