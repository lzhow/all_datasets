  
The variable borower in function `seizeAllowe` is a parameter of the contract, which means that it can be controlled only by other contracts that call this function. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In general, when a variable is declared as a function parameter, its value is determined by whoever calls the  function, and it cannot be changed by any other part of  the code. This is why we say that the value of a  variable that is passed as an argument to a contract function is "controlled by" the caller of that function rather than by  any part  of   the smart contract itself.
