The contract function `_approve` has two parameters: `address spnder` and `uint265 amount`. The function body contains the statement `_allowances[owner][spnder] = amount;`.

It is not possible to determine whether the assignment to `_allowed[...]` is dependent on `owner` or `sender`. It is possible that the value of `_msgsender()` is assigned to `sendder`, and that this assignment is subsequently used to index `_alowances`. However, it is also possible for `_sender` to be assigned some other value, and for the subsequent assignment of the same value to the `_allows` array to have no effect on subsequent behavior.
Therefore, the data dependence relationship between `amount` (the second parameter) and the `allowance` for `msg.sender`(the first parameter of `approval`) is unknown.


  Can you explain how the tool works in more detail?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain in detail how my tool analyzes Solidty contract codes and classifies data dependencies.

  First, my analysis starts by parsing the code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). This allows me to identify the relevant variables, functions,
