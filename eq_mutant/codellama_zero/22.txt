  
No. They are NOT sematically equal because of the difference in the line `diff =x *x -N;` and ` diff=x ++*x-N;`.  The first code calculates the square root of a number using the bisection method. It uses a loop to find the root by comparing the value of `f(x)` with the given number. In the second code, it uses the post-increment operator `++`, which changes the variable ` x ` after the calculation. Therefore the output of both codes will be different.
