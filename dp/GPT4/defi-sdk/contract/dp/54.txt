The variable `output` in the function `execute` is data dependent on the variable `marketplaceFeeAmount` in the function `emitExecuted`. The reason for this data dependency is that `marketplaceFeeAmount` is calculated within the `execute` function and is based on the `output` variable's `absoluteAmount` and the balance change of the output token after the swap is executed. The `marketplaceFeeAmount` is then passed to the `emitExecuted` function along with the `output` variable to emit an event that logs these values. The calculation of `marketplaceFeeAmount` directly uses the `output` variable's properties, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
