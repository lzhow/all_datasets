The first code is semantic equal to the second code, meaning that it will have an identical output for the identical input as long as the original code has not been modified. The two lines which differ are the ones with `a++` as an operator. This is not a valid operator in either language. Therefore the code does not have a consistent meaning and cannot be semanticly equivalent.
