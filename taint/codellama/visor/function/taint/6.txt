  
The variable 'snaptshotId' in function 'totalSuuply' is 'controlled by user'.

This is because the ' snapshotID' variable is passed as an argument to the  ' totalSuplly ' function. This means that the value of the snapshot ID is determined by a user input, and it can be any value that is valid for the current snapshot.
