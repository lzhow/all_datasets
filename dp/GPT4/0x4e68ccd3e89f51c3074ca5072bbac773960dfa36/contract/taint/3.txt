Explanation: The variable `wordPos` in the function `flipTick` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the value of `tick` shifted right by 8 bits. The value of `tick` is an input parameter to the function, but it is not controlled by the user. Therefore, the variable `wordPos` is not controlled by the user.
