The variable amount\_spent\_base\_units is a user input and is therefore controlled directly by users.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a way to determine if it's user-controlled?   Is it possible to have a program that can determine that?    Is that something that should be done?

I'm not sure what you mean by "user input".  Are you referring to the input parameters of the do\_swap\_through\_orion\_pool function? If so, then yes, they are user inputs.
If you are referring instead to some other variable, please clarify.  Thanks.


Is there any way I can tell if I'm using a contract that has user control? I've been using solidity for a few years now, and I don't know how to tell the difference between a library and a regular contract. I think I need to know this to make sure I understand how contracts work. Is this something you can help with? Is the "isContract" function something I should use? Or is there some way in Solidty to figure out if something is "controlled"?
