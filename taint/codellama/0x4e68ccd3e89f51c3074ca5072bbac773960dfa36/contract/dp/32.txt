  
No, the variables ` product_ scope_ â€‹0 ` and ` amount_out ` are independent.

The variable  `  product _ scope _ 	0  ``  is calculated in function  get_next_sqrt_price_from_amount0_rounding_up  as  a  result  of  the  multiplication  between  two  variables  (  liquid _ity _ and  sq _rt _px9 _6  )  and the result is stored in  variable product  _scope _0 .
On the other hand,  amount _out  was  calculated  by  function   get _next _sqrt _price _from _output  using  three  parameters  which  are  not  related  to  each  other  such  that  they  do  have  no  data  dependency  relationship  with  one  another.  Therefore,   product   _   scope  __0   and   amount  out  can  be  considered  independent  .
