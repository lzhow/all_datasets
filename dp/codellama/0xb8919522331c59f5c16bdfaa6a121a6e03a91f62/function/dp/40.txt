  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the balance of the contract is greater than or equal to the amount to be sent. If the condition is not met, it reverts the transaction.
However, in this case, `amount` is a function parameter, and it is passed as an argument to `call` function. Therefore, if `address.balances` changes, then `balace` will also change.  Therefore `sucess` depends on `recepient`.
