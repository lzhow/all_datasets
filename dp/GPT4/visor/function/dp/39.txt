Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` is an input parameter that is independent of any other variables outside of its own function scope. It is used to determine if the given address is a contract. On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is also an input parameter that represents the address on which the contract is attempting to call a function with some `value`. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `account` and `target` as they are used in separate functions and there is no code indicating that the value of `account` is derived from or affects the value of `target`. Each function's parameters are passed independently by the callers of these functions, and without additional context or code showing a connection, we cannot assume any data dependency between them.
