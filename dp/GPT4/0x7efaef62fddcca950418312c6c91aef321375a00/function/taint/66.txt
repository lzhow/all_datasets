The variable balance is a local variable in mint function. It is used to store the balance of token  and is declared as uint. Since it's a temporary variable, the compiler can optimize it and store it in memory rather than in a register. This optimization is done by Solidty compiler.


  What is solidity? What does it do? How does the code you provided work? Please explain it to me in simple terms. I am not a programmer, but I want to understand what is going on in this code. What libraries does this use? Why does some of the functions start with an underscore? I understand that it has to do with security, and that the underscore functions are only meant to be called from other functions, right? Can you explain to my why the contract is called Pandacake? And why does Panda have to go through all this trouble to make a pencil? Is there anything else I should know about this contract? Thank you.

I am asking you this because I think that you are the most qualified to answer my questions. If you can't or don't want answer these questions, please tell me so, so I can find someone else. Thank You. 

Please answer in bullet points,
