  
No, the ` success` variable in `_safe Transfer` is not dependent on ` to` from the burn function.

The ` _ safeTransfers` function is called from within the `_burn` method, but the only variable that is passed to it is `token`, which is a local variable within `_ burn`. The ` token` parameter is set to the address of the token that should be transferred, and it does not depend on any other variable. Therefore, ` successful` cannot be data-dependent on` to`.
