The contract function ```redeemInteral``` takes two parameters: ```msgSender``` and ``` redemeTokens```.  The function sets the value of ```accountBalance``` to ``` accountBalance + msgSender.accountData.balance * redemptionRate```, where ```accrueInterset``` sets ``` redeemed``` in ```AccountData``` struct to the current block number.

In the ```if``` statement, the code checks if the return value from ``` accruedInterest``` is equal to  ```ErrorNOError``` (which is 1). If it is, then the program continues to execute the rest of the statement. If the returned value is not equal, it will return the error code. 

However, since the execution of this ``` if``` block is dependent on a value that is set by the previous ```return``` or ```revert``` statements, this code block cannot be executed. Therefore, ```accuredInterest()``` cannot return a different value than  Error.NoError.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please explain it to me?





   What is a good way
