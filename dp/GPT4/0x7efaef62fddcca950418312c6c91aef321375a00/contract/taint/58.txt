Label: yes

Reason: The variable `balance1` in the function `swap` is indirectly controlled by the user because it is assigned the balance of `token1` held by the contract address, which can change based on the actions of users. When a user calls the `swap` function, they can affect the balance of `token1` by the amounts they choose to swap in or out. The `swap` function is designed to be called by users who are exchanging tokens, and as such, the resulting balances after the swap (`balance0` and `balance1`) are dependent on the user's input and actions. Therefore, `balance1` is considered to be controlled by the user.
