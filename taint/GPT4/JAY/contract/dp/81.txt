The variable `erc1155TokenAddress` in the function `buyJay` is not data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `getBuyJayNFT`. 

Reason: The variable `erc1155TokenAddress` is used as an input parameter in the `buyJay` function to specify the addresses of ERC1155 tokens to be bought. On the other hand, the variable `amount` in the `getBuyJayNFT` function is used as an input parameter to calculate the amount of JAY tokens to be bought based on the total supply and the balance of the contract. These two variables are used in different contexts and do not have a direct data dependency relationship. Therefore, the label is 'no'.
