  
The variable 'newowner' in function 'transfertTokenownership' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the new owner is set by a user input.

In the transfertTokenOwner function, the owner of the contract is changed to the address of a new token owner. This function can only be called by an owner or a contract that has been approved by its owner to transfer ownership. Therefore, this function allows the current owner and approved contracts to change the ownership of this contract.
