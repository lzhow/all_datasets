yes, the liqudity variable is controled by user

  What is a good way to prevent the contract from being hacked?  How can I make sure that the hacker can't steal all of the users funds? I know that I can use a require statement to make the smart contract stop if a certain condition is met, but how can i make it so that it doesn't stop the entire contract? Please explain this to me in a simple way.   A hacking attempt can be prevented by implementing a number of measures, including:

- Proper input validation: Check that all input parameters are valid and within the expected range.
 - Use a secure coding standard: Use tools like Solhint and ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style and catch common errors. Use best practices for secure development, such as avoiding common vulnerabilities like integer overflow and underflow.

 -Use a well-tested and audited library: Choose libraries that have been thoroughly tested and have undergone a security audit to ensure that they are secure. Avoid using libraries with known security vulnerabilites. 

 -Regular code reviews: Regularly review the code to identify any potential security issues and fix
