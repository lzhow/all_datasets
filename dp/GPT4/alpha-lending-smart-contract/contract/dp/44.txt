The contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `_amount` in the function `burn`. This is because the `_burn` function, which is called by the `burn` function, modifies the `_balances` mapping for the `_account` key by subtracting the `_amount` from the current balance. The `sub` function from the SafeMath library is used to perform this operation, which ensures that the subtraction does not result in an underflow. The subtraction operation directly involves the `_amount` variable, establishing a data dependency relationship between `_balances` and `_amount`.
