No, the variable `_address` in the function `updateDevWallet` is not data dependent on the variable `_tokenAddress` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155`. 

The reason is that there is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `_tokenAddress` in the function `updateDevWallet`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
