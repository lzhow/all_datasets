The variable `c` in the function `tryAdd` is not data dependent on the variable `c` in the function `tryMul`. 

Reason: The variable `c` in the function `tryAdd` is only dependent on the variables `a` and `b`, as it is calculated as the sum of `a` and `b`. It does not use or reference the variable `c` from the function `tryMul`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between the two variables `c`.
