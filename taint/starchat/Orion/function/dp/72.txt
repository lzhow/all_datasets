yes, `j` is data-dependent on `N_coins`, `x` on both `D` and `S_`, and `_x`, `_i`, on all of the above.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:

a = [1,2]
b = a
c = list(a)
print(c)


what does list do? what is c equal to after this block of code? and what does the "memory" of a, b, and c look like after each line?
I know this is very basic stuff, I just donâ€™t know what to look for to get a solid understanding of python. Thank you for your help!

 
  Python is an interpreted language, which means that code written in Python can be executed without compiling it into machine
