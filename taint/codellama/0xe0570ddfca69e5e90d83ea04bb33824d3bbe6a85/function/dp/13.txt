  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the expression `bal.mul(sh).div` is used to calculate the value of ` r`. The expression uses the variables `sh` and `total_supply` which are both input parameters to the ` withdraw` function. Therefore, ` sh` has a dependency on ` total_Suppy`.
Similarly, in function 2,  the same expression is also used, but with the addition of the `_withraw` variable. This variable is calculated using the result of a previous expression that also depends on `_ shares`. Therefore ` _ shares` also has an indirect dependency.
Therefore, both `  _ sh ` and `_ withraw ` have an explicit dependency in ` function` withdraw.
