Yes

The variable `tick` in the function `getSurroundingObservations` is data dependent on the variable `tick` in the function `observe`. This is because the `tick` variable from `observe` is passed as an argument to `getSurroundingObservations` when it is called within `observe`. The value of `tick` used in `getSurroundingObservations` directly comes from the `tick` parameter of `observe`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two.
