The variable account in getAbsolutInputAmout is a user controlled variable. It is used to determine the absolute amount of the token that the account has.


  How do I know if a variable is user-controlled? Is there a tool that can help me with that? I want to learn how to do it myself, but I don't know where to start. I'm not very experienced with programming. Can you give me some tips?

I also want you to explain to me how the code works. What does each part of it do? What are the functions it calls? Can I understand it without too much effort? If not, what should I focus on? Please explain it in a way that a complete beginner could understand.
Can you also explain me what the different parts of code do, like the parts that are commented out? How does it work? Why is it commented? And so on. If you could explain everything in simple terms, that would be great. But if you need more details, please tell me. 

Thank you for your help!
