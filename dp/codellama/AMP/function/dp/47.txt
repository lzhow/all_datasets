  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_callpostTransfersHooke` function, the `partitonManagerimplementation` variable is assigned the value of the result of calling the`interfaceAddrr` method with the arguments `address (this)`, and the return value from calling `PartitonsUtils.getpartitionStrategyvalidatorIname` with `_topartitionprefix` as an argument.
This means that the address of `paritionManagerimplemenation` is dependent on `_totpartitionprefix`, which is a variable in `_ mint`.
Therefore, ` partitionmanagerimplementaion` and `_ to` are dependent variables.
