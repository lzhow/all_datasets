Reason: The variable `oldAdmin` in the function `changeAdmin` is assigned the value of the state variable `admin` before it is updated to `newAdmin`. The state variable `admin` represents the administrator of the contract, which is typically set during contract deployment and can only be changed by the current admin through the `changeAdmin` function. Since `oldAdmin` is a local variable that simply holds the previous value of the `admin` state variable and is not directly set by an external user, it is not controlled by the user. It is controlled by the contract logic itself, specifically by the current admin who has the privilege to call `changeAdmin`.
