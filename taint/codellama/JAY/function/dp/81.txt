  
The label is 'No'.

In the `buyJawWithErc712` function, the loop variable 'id' is not dependent on any variable in `jaytoeth`. The loop iterates over the length of the 'ids' array, which is a separate variable from the one used in 'jawtoet'. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
