Label: no

Reason: The variable `to` in the function `_safeTransfer` is a parameter that specifies the recipient address for the token transfer. The contract state `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` is not referenced or modified within the `_safeTransfer` function, nor is it used in any calculations or conditions that involve the `to` variable. Since there is no interaction or dependency between `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` and `to` within the given function, they are not data dependent.
