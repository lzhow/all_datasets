In the given code, the `want()` function returns a `uint` value, which is then used as an argument to the `.balenceOf()` method of the `_wants` contract. This means that the value of `_wallets` is dependent on `address (this)` and `amount`, which are both variables in `function available()`. Therefore, `_ balances ` is data-dependent on `_amount`.
