   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to understand if I should use it in my own projects or not. Thanks!
  
   An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This makes it easier for the browser to load the application and makes the initial load time faster.

   Webpack is probably the most popular example of an incremental bundle tool. It takes in entry points, which are the main files of the web app, and recursively processes all of their dependencies, creating a graph of modules. Then it uses various loaders and plugins to transform and optimize each module, before finally outputting a bundle file.

Webpack is very flexible and can do a lot of different things, from compiling Sass to optimizing images. However, the default configuration may not work well for every project, so it's important to customize it according to your specific needs
