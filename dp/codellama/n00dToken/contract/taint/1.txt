The `_m int` function in `ER7 7` contract is used to mint new tokens. It takes in four parameters: `operator`, `account`,`amount`, and `userData`. The `amount` parameter is what determines the amount of tokens to be minted.
In the `n oodle` token contract, `_ mint` is called in its constructor to create the initial supply of the token. This means that the value of `_totalsupply`, which is set to `initialSuppl y` in this case, is determined by what is passed in as the constructor parameter ` initial Suppl  y`.
Therefore, `total Supp l y `is not directly controlledby theuser. Instead, its value is derived from a parameter passed to a constructor.
