Label: yes

Reason: The variable `quotient_scope_0` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` is calculated based on the value of the `liquidity` parameter passed to it. This parameter is a direct input to the calculation of `quotient_scope_0`. In the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromInput`, the `liquidity` parameter is also passed as an argument to the `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` function. Therefore, any changes to the `liquidity` variable in `getNextSqrtPriceFromInput` will affect the calculation of `quotient_scope_0` in `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
