Reason: The variable `denominator_scope_1` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context and the typical naming conventions in Solidity, it can be inferred that `denominator_scope_1` refers to the variable `denominator` within the scope of the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp`.

In the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp`, the variable `denominator` is calculated using the variable `liquidity` and other variables. Specifically, the line `uint256 numerator1 = uint256(liquidity) << FixedPoint96.RESOLUTION;` uses `liquidity` to calculate `numerator1`, which is then used in the calculation of `denominator` in the subsequent lines.

The function `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput` calls `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` and passes the `liquidity` variable as an argument. This means that the value of `liquidity` used in `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` is directly dependent on the value of `liquidity` passed from `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput`.

Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the variable `denominator_scope_1` (assumed to be `denominator` within `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp`) and the variable `liquidity` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput`, as the former's calculation is influenced by the latter's value.
