Reason: The variable `_name` in the constructor function is used to set the name of the contract when it is deployed. It is assigned to the state variable `name` and is not modified afterward. The variable `_origin` in the function `originSwap` is a parameter that specifies the address of the token to be swapped from. There is no direct relationship or computation in the contract code that indicates a data dependency between `_name` and `_origin`. `_name` is used only during contract initialization, while `_origin` is used during the execution of a swap operation, and they serve completely different purposes within the contract.
