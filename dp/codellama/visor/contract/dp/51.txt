  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `tryAdd` function, the value of `a` is added to the local variable  ` c` and the result is stored in ` a`. The value ` b`is not used in this function.
However, in function  sub, `  b ` is subtracted from `   a` to get the  value  of  c. Therefore, variable c is data-dependent on variable b in both functions.
