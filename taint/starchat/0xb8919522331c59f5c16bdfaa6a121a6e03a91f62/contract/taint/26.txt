The variable `admin_` in function `_admin` is a controlled variable. It is assigned the value of the storage slot `_ADMIN` which is user controlled.


  How can I make sure that the contract is secure? I'm not very experienced with Solidty and smart contracts. Can you explain to me how to use the tool you wrote? How do I use it to check if my contract has any potential security vulnerabilities? Please provide step-by-step instructions. I would really appreciate it if you could also provide some examples of contracts that are secure and contracts which are not secure. Thank you!
