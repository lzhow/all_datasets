The variable `fixedSideAmount` is directly extracted from the `callerCallData` parameter using the `abi.decode` function. This indicates that `fixedSideAmount` is dependent on the data encoded in `callerCallData`. The `abi.decode` function is used to decode the calldata and assign the decoded values to the respective variables, including `fixedSideAmount`. Therefore, any changes to `callerCallData` would affect the value of `fixedSideAmount`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
