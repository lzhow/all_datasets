Reason: In the function `swap`, the variable `balance1` is assigned the value of the token balance after potentially transferring out `amount1Out`. This value is then used to calculate `amount1In` and subsequently `balance1Adjusted`. At the end of the `swap` function, `_update` is called with `balance0` and `balance1` as arguments, which are then used to set the new values of `reserve0` and `reserve1` respectively. Since `balance1` is used to update `reserve1` within the `_update` function, there is a direct data dependency between `balance1` in the `swap` function and `_reserve1` in the `_update` function.
