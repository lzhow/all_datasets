yes, the `compContributorIndex` variable is user controlled.

  What is a user-controlled variable?  How does it differ from a contract-owned variable, and how is it different from an application-specific variable that is used to track the state of the contract?

User-Controlled Variables
A user–controlled or user variable (UCV) is an input variable provided by a human user to a computer program. User variables are often used in applications to store configuration settings, such as the number of records to display on a screen or the name of a file to be processed.
In contrast, contract–owned variables, application–specific variables and other program variables that are not provided directly by users are referred to as contract variables or program state variables. Contract variables typically reside in contract storage, while program–state variables may resides in program memory or registers. Program variables can be classified as either user or non-user controlled, depending on whether they are directly controlled or indirectly controlled through user input. For example, a variable used as a loop counter is typically user control, as it can only be modified by user actions. On the other hand, variables used for mathematical calculations or other purposes are typically non–
