  
No, the variables ` seconds Per Liqidty Cumulatve X1 88 ` and ` liquiditYGros sAfter ` are independent.

The variable  `  seconds  Per  Li q uid ty  C umul ative  X  l 6 4  '  is a parameter of the ` update ` function, which means it is not dependent on any other variable in this function. On the other hand, ` liquit yGro sAf ter ` is an internal variable of this ` updat e `function, and it depends on other variables in `updat e` function such as `liq u idty Delta` and  other internal variables. Therefore, these two variable are dependent in different ways.
