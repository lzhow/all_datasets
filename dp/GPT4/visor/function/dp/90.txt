Label: no

Reason: The variable `value` in the function `safeTransfer` is used to specify the amount of tokens to be transferred to the address `to`. It is passed directly to the `_callOptionalReturn` function along with the `token.transfer.selector`. On the other hand, the variable `spender` in the function `safeIncreaseAllowance` is used to specify the address that is allowed to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the contract. The new allowance is calculated and then passed to the `_callOptionalReturn` function along with the `token.approve.selector`.

There is no direct interaction or computational relationship between `value` and `spender` within the given code. `value` is related to a transfer operation, while `spender` is related to an approval operation. They operate independently within their respective functions and are used for different purposes. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
