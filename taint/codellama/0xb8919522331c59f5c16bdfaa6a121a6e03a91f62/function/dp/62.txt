  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `upgradetoAndcall` function, the parameter ` newimplementation` is passed to the `_upgradoToandCallsecure` internal function. This means that the value of `NewImplemenation` variable in `UpgradetooAndcal` will be used as an argument for the internal `_Authorizeupgradep`function. Therefore, ` NewImplementaion`in ` UpgradtooAndCal`is data-dependent on `NeWImpelementation `in `_ AuthorizeuPgrade`.
