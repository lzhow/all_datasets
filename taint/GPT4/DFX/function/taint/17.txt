Explanation: The variable `_quoteWeight` in the function `proportionalDeposit` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of `curve.weights[1].mulu(1e18)`, which is a constant value derived from the `curve` storage variable. The user does not have any control or influence over this value.
