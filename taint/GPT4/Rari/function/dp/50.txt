Explanation: The contract state `mantissaOne` is not data dependent on the variable `newBorrowCaps` in the function `_setMarketBorrowCaps`. This is because there is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `newBorrowCaps` in relation to `mantissaOne` within the given code. Therefore, there is no data dependency between them.
