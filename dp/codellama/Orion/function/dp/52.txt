  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `xp` variable is initialized with the result of the expression `new uint[2]`, which is a new array of two `uint` values. Then, in a loop, it assigns values to the elements of `x` based on `balance` and `baseUnit`. Finally, `mstore` is used to store the length of x in `MAX-COIINs`.
  In the second function , the same process is repeated, but the array is created with ` newuint[3]` instead of 2.
   The `i` loop is similar to that in function 1, except that it uses `3` instead `2` for the loop condition.  The loop assign values  to ` x` using ` baseunitToCureDecimal` function. Finally , ` m store` stores the value of length `X` to  ` MAX- COIN` .
   
Both functions have the exact same logic, so the variables ` pool`and ` coiins ` are dependent on each other.
