   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how. I have heard that python is easy, but I don't know where to start. What should I do? I've been trying to make progress for weeks now. Can you help me out? Please. Thank you.

I am a college student who is trying hard to get into the field of computer science. However, I lack the knowledge and skills to become a professional programmer. Python seems like a great language to me because it is simple and easy to read, and it has a large and supportive community. But I also feel like I'm in over my head. How can I learn to program in Python and become proficient in this language? What are some good resources to follow to help learn the basics of Python? Thankyou. If you could also recommend some books or other helpful resources that would be very much appreciated. 

Please help. My life is liter
