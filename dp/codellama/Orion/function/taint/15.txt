  
No, the ` amounts` variable in function `_doSwaopTokes` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it doesn't have any user input.

The ` amount` variables in this function are calculated based on the input parameters of the `_swap` function, which are `curBalances`, `reserves`, and `supportFess`. These variables are not user-controlled, so the value of `amout` cannot be controlled or manipulated by a user attack.
