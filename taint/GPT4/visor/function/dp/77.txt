Label: no

Reason: In the provided Solidity code, the variable `sender` is an input parameter to the function `transferFrom`, and so is the variable `recipient`. Both are used independently within the function. The variable `sender` is used to index the `_allowances` mapping and to specify the address from which the tokens are being transferred. The variable `recipient`, on the other hand, is used as the destination address for the `_transfer` function call. There is no direct data dependency between `sender` and `recipient` within the `transferFrom` function; they do not influence each other's value or state. The operations on `sender` are separate from the operations on `recipient`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
