Explanation: The variable `Ann` in the function `get_D` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the value of the `amp` parameter, which is passed as an argument to the function. The value of `amp` is determined by the contract logic and is not influenced by user input. Therefore, the variable `Ann` is not controlled by the user.
