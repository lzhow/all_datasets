Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `proxy` in the function `getProxyAdmin` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is public and does not have any restrictions on who can call it, any user can call this function and pass any `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract address as the `proxy` argument. Therefore, the value of the `proxy` variable is controlled by the user who invokes the function.
