Explanation: The variable `success2` in the function `sell` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the result of the `call` function, which is used to transfer ETH to the `dev` address. The value of `success2` depends on the success of the ETH transfer, which is determined by the Ethereum network and not controlled by the user.
