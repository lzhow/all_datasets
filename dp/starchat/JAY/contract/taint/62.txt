   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!




An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and images, into a single file that can be served to the browser. This makes it easier for the web browser to load the application and make it more responsive.

The incremental part of the bundlers job is to only update the portions of code that have changed since the last time the tool was run. For example, if you make a change to a JavaScript file, only the changed code will be included in subsequent builds, reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent to users.


Webpack is probably the most popular example of an incremental web bundiler. It can take in multiple types of assets, including JavaScript modules, images and CSS stylesheets, then bundle them
