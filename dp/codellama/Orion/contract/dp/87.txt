  
No, the variables `_ factory` and ` i` are independent.

The variable  `_factor` is a constant that is assigned a value in line 3 of the constructor function. It is not dependent on any other variable or function in this contract.  On the other hand, `I`is a local variable in function  ` updatefactors` that represents the index of a loop. However, it is only used within the scope of this function and is never passed as an argument to any external function or used as a return value. Therefore, `_ factor`and ` I`are independent variables.
