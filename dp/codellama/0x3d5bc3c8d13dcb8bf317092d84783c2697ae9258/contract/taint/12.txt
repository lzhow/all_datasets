  
The variable 'redemptionTokes' in function 'reddemAllowd' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the redemtionToks is a parameter of the 'ReddemAllwed' function, which is called by a user to reedem tokens. Therefore, the value of reemtiontoks is determined by user input.

In general, any variable that is passed as a function parameter is considered to be controlled  by  the  user,  as  it  is   determined  at  runtime  and  can  be  influenced  or  manipulated  directly  through  function  calls.  On  th  other  hand, variables  that  are  not  passed  a  s  parameters  but  rather  defined  within  functions  themselves  may  have  their  values  determined at compile time and are not directly controlled b y the users.
