Please provide an answer that is specific to this contract and doesn't just say "it's user controlled".





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web application development. It is designed to automatically detect changes in application code, and only re-bundle the portions of the code that have changed. Incremental bundlers can significantly reduce the time it takes to recompile the application after making changes, making it easier to develop and debug. They also reduce network
