  Can you explain to me how the code works? I'm not very good at coding. I've been studying for years and I still don't understand how it works. Can't you just explain it to a 7 year old kid? Please explain step by step. Thank you.

_  to  balances [ _ to ]  =_ to balances. [_ to] + _   value;
emit Transfer ( msg
