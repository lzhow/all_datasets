The variable `feeGrowthInside1X128` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is data dependent on the variable `feeGrowthBelow1X128` within the same function. This is because `feeGrowthInside1X128` is calculated using `feeGrowthBelow1X128` as part of its computation:

```solidity
feeGrowthInside1X128 = feeGrowthGlobal1X128 - feeGrowthBelow1X128 - feeGrowthAbove1X128;
```

Here, `feeGrowthInside1X128` is directly affected by the value of `feeGrowthBelow1X128`, as it is subtracted from `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` along with `feeGrowthAbove1X128` to determine the final value of `feeGrowthInside1X128`.
