  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `require` statement checks that the result of `x +y ` is greater than or equal to ` x`. This means that ` z` is dependent on ` y`.
Similarly, in second function the require statement also checks the same condition.
Therefore, `Z` and `Y` are dependent in both functions.
