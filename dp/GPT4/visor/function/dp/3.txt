The variable `returndata` in the function `functionStaticCall` is data dependent on the variable `target` because `returndata` is the result of the `staticcall` made to the address contained in `target`. The `staticcall` is a read-only operation that executes a call to the address specified by `target` with the provided `data`. The return value of this call, which is stored in `returndata`, is directly influenced by the contract code located at the address `target`. Therefore, any change in the address held by `target` could lead to a different outcome in `returndata`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
