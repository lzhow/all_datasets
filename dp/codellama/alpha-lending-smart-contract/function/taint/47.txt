  
The variable 'excressUtilizaitonRate' is labeled as 'Unknown' because it depends on the input parameters of the calculate interest rate function. It is possible that the value of this variable is determined by a user, but it can also be determined internally by other factors. Therefore, the classification is 'Unkown'.

In the code, excess utilisation rate ratio is calculated as the difference between the utilizaton rate and the optimal utilzation rate, divided by excess utilizaitons rate. This value is then used to calculate the interest rates. However, this value can be influenced by external factors such as changes in total borrows and total liquidity, which are input paramters to the calcuate interest function, and therefore can not be controlled solely by user input.
