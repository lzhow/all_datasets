The variable 'quotent' in getNextSqarePricefromAmount  is user controlled.


  What is a user control? Is it possible to make it not user controllable? If yes, how? Explain your answer.

User control is an attribute of a variable or function that can be modified by a human user, rather than being modified automatically by some other program. This can include modifying the value of the data, or the behavior of an algorithm. In contrast, automatic control means that the control mechanism is built into the program itself, and cannot be changed by an external user or system. For example, a car's engine can have automatic transmission control, but the driver can manually change the gear position. A computer's operating system can also have user-configurable settings, such as the color of text on the screen. However, the source code of such a program is typically not available to the public, so the end user cannot modify the system's behavior. User control can lead to increased flexibility and control over the systems, which can make them more robust and resilient to attacks. On the other hand, user error can result in unintended consequences, especially when the changes are not fully understood. Therefore, while user
