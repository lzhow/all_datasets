Label: yes

Reason: The variable `pool` in the function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityShareAmount` is data dependent on the variable `_token` in the function `totalBorrowInUSD` because both variables are used to access the `pools` mapping with the address of the ERC20 token as the key. In `calculateRoundDownLiquidityShareAmount`, `pool` is a reference to `pools[address(_token)]`, and in `totalBorrowInUSD`, the `pools` mapping is accessed again with `pools[address(_token)].totalBorrows`. Since both functions use `_token` to reference the same mapping and potentially the same storage location within that mapping, there is a data dependency between `pool` and `_token`.
