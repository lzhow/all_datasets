Yes, the variable `pool` in the function `_swapCurve` is data dependent on the variable `curFactory` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of the variable `pool` is determined by the result of the function `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.pairForCurve(curFactory, input, output)`, where `curFactory` is one of the input parameters. Therefore, any change in the value of `curFactory` will directly affect the value of `pool`, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
