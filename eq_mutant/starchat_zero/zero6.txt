Here is how I would analyze these two provided pieces of code in Java to determine if semantic equivalence holds:

1. Both codes define a class named Quicksort with a few private methods and a public method called sort.

2. The sort method in both codes appears to be performing the exact same actions, although they may use different variable names. For example, in the first code block, the variable 'bound' is used, while in another block (the mutated code), the name has been changed to 'i' (i is not a reserved keyword in java, so it can be used without any issues).

3. In the private method quickSort, both pieces have a while loop that compares the lower and upper bounds of the data array, and then swap elements as needed. It looks like these loops would eventually terminate, because there is always at least one element in each array. However, for best performance, you may want to add a base case to the loops, as this could help avoid unnecessary iterations.

Overall, these examples have some similarities, but they differ in important ways, which would make them different programs. Therefore, it is safe to say that these code snippets are __not semantic equivalent in terms of their intended
