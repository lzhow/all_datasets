Reason: The variable `bitPos` in the function `flipTick` is determined by the result of the `position` function, which takes the `tick` variable as its argument. The calculation of `bitPos` within the `position` function is based solely on the `tick` value and does not involve `tickSpacing`. The `tickSpacing` variable is used elsewhere in the `flipTick` function to ensure that the `tick` is a multiple of `tickSpacing` (as part of the `require` statement) and to calculate the `wordPos` by dividing `tick` by `tickSpacing`. However, `tickSpacing` does not influence the calculation of `bitPos` directly. Therefore, `bitPos` is not data dependent on `tickSpacing`.
