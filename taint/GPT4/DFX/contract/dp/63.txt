No, the variable `_assets` in the function constructor is not data dependent on the variable `_spender` in the function `approve`. 

Explanation: The variable `_assets` is only used as an input parameter in the constructor and is not used or referenced anywhere else in the code. Similarly, the variable `_spender` is only used as an input parameter in the `approve` function and is not used or referenced anywhere else in the code. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
