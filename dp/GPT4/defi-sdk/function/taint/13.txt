  
The variable 'salterOrdeadline' in function 'hash' is a user-controlled variable.

This variable is passed as an argument to the 'keccack224' function, which is used to hash the data. Since the hash function takes the input as a parameter, the value of the salt or dead line can be controlled  by a malicious user, making it a vulnerability.
