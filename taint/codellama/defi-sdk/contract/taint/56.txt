The variable is declared as a mapping with a private visibility, which means that it can only be accessed within the contract. It is also initialized with an empty mapping, so it does not contain any user-controlled data. Therefore, the value of the `hashUsd` variable in this function cannot be controlled directly by a user, and the answer is no.
