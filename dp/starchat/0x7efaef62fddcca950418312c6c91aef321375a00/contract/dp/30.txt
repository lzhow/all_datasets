   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python" is pronounced like the English word "benevolent."
Guido van Rossum began working on Python in  the late 80s as a successor to the ABC programminglanguage and first released it in February  Ì89 as Python  Release . Python's design has since evolved from Guido's original ideas, and its features have become more consistently useful in practice over time.
