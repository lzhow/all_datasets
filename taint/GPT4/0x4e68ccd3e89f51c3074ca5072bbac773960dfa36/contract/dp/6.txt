The variable `tokensOwed1` in the `update` function of the `Position` library is data dependent on the variable `self`. The reason for this is that `tokensOwed1` is calculated based on the difference between `feeGrowthInside1X128` and `self.feeGrowthInside1LastX128`, which is a property of `self`. Additionally, the final value of `tokensOwed1` is used to update `self.tokensOwed1` by adding the calculated `tokensOwed1` to the existing `self.tokensOwed1`. This clearly establishes a data dependency relationship between `tokensOwed1` and `self`, as the value of `tokensOwed1` is derived from and used to update the state of `self`.
