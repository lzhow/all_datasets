The variable `fromBlock` in the function `getReleaseAmount` is data dependent on the variable `lastBlock` in the same function. This is because the value of `fromBlock` is conditionally modified based on the comparison with `lastBlock`. Specifically, the line `uint256 toBlock = _toBlock < lastBlock ? _toBlock : lastBlock;` determines the value of `toBlock` based on `lastBlock`, and subsequently, the `while` loop uses `fromBlock` and `toBlock` to calculate `totalAmount`. The loop continues while `fromBlock < toBlock`, and since `toBlock` can be equal to `lastBlock`, the loop's execution and the calculations within it are influenced by the value of `lastBlock`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `fromBlock` and `lastBlock`.
