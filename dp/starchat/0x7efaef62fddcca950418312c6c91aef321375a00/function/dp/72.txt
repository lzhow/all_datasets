   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and being sent to youtube to watch random videos. I want to do it the "right" way. What books, websites, or other methods should I use? Please list at least 5. Also, please provide a short (1-2 sentence) explanation of each. Thank you.

I also want a list of "must-have" libraries or frameworks. Again, 1 or 2 sentences explaining each would be great. For example, I heard about "numpy" for numerical computing, but I don't know what that is. Can you explain that in simple terms too?
Thank you!
