The variable `low` in the function `findUpperBound` is data dependent on the variable `mid` because the value of `low` is updated based on the value of `mid` within the while loop. Specifically, the line `low = mid + 1;` indicates that `low` is directly assigned a value that is derived from the current value of `mid`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `low` and `mid` within the `findUpperBound` function.
