  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `require` statement checks if the value of ` snapshotID` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the current snapshot ID. This means that the `_ currentSnapshotID. current()` function is called, which is a contract function that returns the latest snapshot id. Therefore, `_ valueAt` function depends on `_CurrentSnapshotid` contract variable.
