Label: yes

Reason: The contract state `_totalSupply` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyERC1155`. This is because the variable `amounts` is used to calculate the value of `amount` in the for loop. The value of `amount` is then returned by the function, which means it can potentially affect the state of `_totalSupply`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_totalSupply` and `amounts`.
