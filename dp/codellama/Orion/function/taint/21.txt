  
The variable _ factory in function  constructor  is labeled as ' yes'. The reason is that the constructor function takes the _  factory  parameter as an immutably stored address, which means that it cannot be changed after the contract is deployed. Therefore, the value of _ _ factor  cannot  be controlled  by  the  user  and  it  can  only  have  a  fixed  value  that  was  specified  when  deploying  contract.

In summary, _factor is a constant variable that is set when the smart contract  deployed and cannot change after that. It is therefore controlled and not user-controlled.
