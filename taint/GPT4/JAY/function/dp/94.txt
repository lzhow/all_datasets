The variable `amount` in the function `buyERC1155` is not data dependent on the variable `_price` in the function `updateFees`. 

Reason: The variable `amount` is calculated based on the values in the `amounts` array, which is passed as an argument to the `buyERC1155` function. It does not depend on the value of `_price` or any other variable in the `updateFees` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
