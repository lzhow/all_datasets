The variable SELECTor is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled.


  What is an example of a user controlled variable?

User-controllable variables are those that can be changed by a person or entity other than the program itself. They are often used to control program flow, such as in decision-making or looping constructs.
In contrast, variables that are not directly user controllable are called system-generated variables. These variables can change automatically as the result of calculations or other events within the system. For example, the value of the loop variable in a for loop is system generated. It is updated automatically each time the body of that loop executes. However, a variable that is used as a loop counter is typically user generated, as it must be set to a specific value before the looping begins. In general, user control is important for security purposes, particularly in situations where the programmer does not control the input to the code. If the attacker can control some of these variables, they can manipulate the flow of execution or cause the software to behave in unintended ways. User-control is also important in many industries, where users have a vested interest in controlling the behavior of their software. Examples include operating systems,
