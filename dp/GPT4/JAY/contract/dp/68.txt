The variable `erc721Ids` in the function `buyJay` is not data dependent on the variable `success2` in the function `sell`. 

Reason: The variable `erc721Ids` is used as an input parameter for the `buyJay` function, and its value is determined by the caller of the function. On the other hand, the variable `success2` in the `sell` function is a local variable that is assigned the result of a function call. There is no direct data dependency between these two variables.
