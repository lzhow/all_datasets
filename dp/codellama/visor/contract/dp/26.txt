  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `while` loop of the findLowerBound function, the value of `high` is calculated using the average function. This means that the calculation of high depends on both `array` and `element`.
Since `averge` function is called with `Math.low`, `math.high`, and the result is assigned to `middle`, the data dependence is established between `Middle`and `High`.
