The variable senderImplemenation is a contract address that is set by a user, and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? I'm not sure what you mean by "controlled" in this context. Can you explain what that means? Is it like a reference to a pointer? Or is it a way of protecting data? If it's the latter, how do you know what is "user" controlled and what isn't? Can I just assume that if it has a name that starts with an underscore, then it must be user-controlled? What if I have a function that takes a parameter named "sender" and sets the value of that parameter to the result of a calculation? How can I tell if that "calculation" is actually user input or not? It seems like the answer to this question depends on the context of the code, which is why I asked you to clarify the definition of "control" so I could better understand your question. I would appreciate it if you could clarify this for me. Thank you.

In general, I think it would be helpful to have some examples of common programming patterns and how to identify user control in each case. For example, if there is
