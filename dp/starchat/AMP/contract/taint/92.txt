The variable `isOperated` in `function isOperater(addres _operater, addres_ tokenHolder)` is a state variable that is used to track whether or not an operator has been authorized to transfer tokens on behalf of a token holder. This variable is set to `true` when an authorized operator calls the `authorizeOperator` function and set back to false when the authorized operater calls `revokeOperator`.

As such, the value of this variable can be considered to be controlled solely by users of the smart contract, and as such it can safely be labeld as "yes".


  How do I know if a variable or function parameter is user controlled or program controlled?  What are some common ways to determine this?
Can you give me a list of 5 programming languages and their ways of determining if something is "user controlled" or "program controlled"?
