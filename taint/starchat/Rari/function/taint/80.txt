The variable a in function `fraction` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a can be influenced by other variables and parameters in a contract, which can affect the behavior of the contract. For example, if a is used in an arithmetic operation, its value can change depending on the values of other contract variables.

To determine if variable is directly controlled or not, you should consider the entire contract and its interactions with other contracts and user inputs.


  How can I determine that?  I'm not sure what you mean by "entire contract".





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I have heard that just starting with the basics and working your way up is usually the best way, but I don't know where to start. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python tutorials? Thank you!
