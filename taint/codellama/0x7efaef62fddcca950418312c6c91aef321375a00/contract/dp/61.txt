  
No, the variables ` fee On` and ` balance  Adjust` are independent.

The variable  `  fee  On ` is defined in function `_m intF ee` as a local variable, and it is not used in any other function. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on any variable in other functions.  The variable` balance Adj` is also defined as local in ` swap` function, but it does not affect the value of ` fe eOn`.
