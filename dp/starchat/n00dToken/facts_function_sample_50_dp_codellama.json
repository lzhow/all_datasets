The internal keyword allows the variables to be used by the inheriting contract but prevents them from being accessed directly by contracts other than the one in which they're declared.

Could you explain it to me?\n  \n  Data dependence is a term used to describe how one variable or value in a program depends on another. In the context of smart contracts, data dependences can occur when one contract or state variable depends directly or indirectly on a value or variable defined in another contract.\nIn the example you provided, `totalsupply`, which is defined as a `uint224` type, is assigned the result of the call to `_burn`, but this value is never used. This means that the assignment to `supply_` is data independent, while the other assignments are dependent on it. \n\nThis is an example of a simple data independance:\n`uint a = 5;\nuint b = a"
