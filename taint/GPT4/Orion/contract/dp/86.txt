Reason: The variable `userAmountIn` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is assigned the value from the tuple `(uint256 userAmountIn, uint256 userAmountOut)` which is the result of the `_doSwapTokens` function call. The `_doSwapTokens` function internally calls the `_swap` function, where the `amounts` array is used to determine the amount of tokens to be swapped at each step of the swap path. The `amounts` array is filled with the output amounts calculated for each swap step, and these amounts are directly related to the `amountIn` parameter of the `_doSwapTokens` function, which is then used to set the value of `userAmountIn`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `userAmountIn` and `amounts` because the value of `userAmountIn` is influenced by the calculations performed using the `amounts` array within the `_swap` function.
