  
The variable 'visrdposit' in function 'depost' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the value of 'vistDepost' comes from the external function call 'require( visrdDepot >0,"depoist mustbe non zero")'. This means that ' visrtDepoist' can be controlled directly by a user who calls the ' deposite' function.

In summary, the answer to the question is yes, because the deposited amount is required to be greater than zero, and the amount can come from an external user calling the " deposits" function, which means the contract is directly controlled.
