In the `StorageSlo`t library, the functions ` get Address Slot`, `GetBoolean S lot`, and ` GetBytes 3 2 S lo t` all use the same ` slot` variable. This means that the value of ` sl o t ` in one function is dependent on its value in another function. Therefore, `slo t  ` is data-dependent on ` slo t`.
