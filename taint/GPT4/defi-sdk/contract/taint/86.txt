The variable `tokenAmount` in the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount` is part of the `TokenAmount` struct, which is passed as a calldata parameter to the function. Calldata is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area where function arguments are stored, and it behaves mostly like memory. This particular function is called within the `execute` function, which is an external function that can be called by anyone. The `tokenAmount` struct includes details about the token and the amount, which are specified by the caller of the `execute` function. Since the caller (user) specifies the arguments when calling `execute`, they have control over the contents of `tokenAmount`, including the `token` address and `amount` fields within it. Therefore, the `tokenAmount` variable is controlled by the user.
