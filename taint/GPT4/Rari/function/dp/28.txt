Reason: The variable `maxClose` in the function `liquidateBorrowAllowed` is not directly dependent on the variable `account` in the function `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternal`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `account` in the calculation of `maxClose`. However, it is possible that `maxClose` indirectly depends on `account` through other variables or functions that are not shown in the provided code snippet. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between `maxClose` and `account`.
