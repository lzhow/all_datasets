The variable whitlistingStage is a boolean that is used to control the whilisting stage of the contract. It is set to true at the beginning of whiltelisting and is then set back to false once all whiitelists have been processed.

As the owner of this contract, you have the ability to set the value of `emergency` to `true` which will freeze all trading and withdrawals. This is to ensure that no one can withdraw their funds from the curve if there is an issue with the code.


  Can you explain how the `notEntered` variable is being used? I don't understand how it's related to the other variables. Can it be removed? If not, what is its purpose?
Can you also explain why the boolean variables `frozen` and `whiteListingStage`, which are both set in a similar way, are not included in this analysis? Why are they not considered? Is there a reason they are treated differently? Can they be merged into a single boolean variable? Please explain your reasoning. I would like to understand the rationale behind your approach to this problem. Thank you.
