Explanation: The variable `_threshold` is calculated based on the value of `_ideal` in both branches of the if-else statement. In the first branch, `_threshold` is calculated as `_ideal.mul(ONE - _beta)`, and in the second branch, `_threshold` is calculated as `_ideal.mul(ONE + _beta)`. Therefore, the value of `_threshold` is dependent on the value of `_ideal`.
