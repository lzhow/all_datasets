yes, the liqudity variable is controled by user input.

  What is a good example of a contract that has user controlled variables?  Can you give me an example?   I want to know how to write a program to do static analysis on solidity contracts.  I am a beginner and would like to learn how this works.   Can I use this tool to find all the places where user controllable variables are used?    Can it find the values that the variables can take?     Can this be used to automatically generate a user interface for a smart contract?

Can you explain what the tool does and how it works? I'm not sure what you mean by "classify if variable or state controlled".
