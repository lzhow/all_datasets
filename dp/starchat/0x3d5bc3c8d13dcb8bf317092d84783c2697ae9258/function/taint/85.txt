The variable "b" in mul_Exp is a user-controlled variable. It is used to scale the result of the multiplication, which could result in an overflow or underlow.


  How can I prevent overflows and underflows? I'm writing a financial smart contract and I need to make sure that my calculations don't result to any loss of precision. I know that Solidty has some built-in functions to prevent under/overflows, but I don;t know which ones to use and how to apply them. Can you give me some examples?

Also, I noticed that you are using some functions with the suffix "unsafe" or "unchecked". Are these functions unsafe? If so, what are the potential consequences of using them? Can I use them in my smart contracts? Please explain to me how these suffixes work and why they are used.
Can you also give some tips on how I can prevent lossy or imprecise calculations in Solidit? What are some best practices to follow? Are there any libraries or frameworks that can help me with this? How do other smart-contract platforms handle this issue? Could you explain how they handle it? Is it even possible to handle such calculations without losing
