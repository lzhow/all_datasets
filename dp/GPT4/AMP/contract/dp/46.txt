The contract state `totalSupplyByPartition` is data dependent on the variable `_value` in the function `_transferByDefaultPartition`. The reason for this is that `_transferByDefaultPartition` internally calls `_transferByPartition`, which in turn calls `_removeTokenFromPartition` and `_addTokenToPartition`. Both of these functions modify `totalSupplyByPartition[_partition]` by subtracting and adding the `_value` respectively, depending on whether tokens are being transferred from or to a partition. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `totalSupplyByPartition` and `_value` as the state of `totalSupplyByPartition` is affected by the value of `_value` during the execution of a transfer.
