Reason: The variable `counter` in the function `current` is of type `Counter storage`, which means it is a state variable that represents the state of the contract on the blockchain. The `current` function simply returns the current value of the `counter` without any user input affecting it directly within this function. However, whether the `counter` is ultimately controlled by the user depends on how the functions `increment` and `decrement` are called in the contract that uses this library. If those functions are called by user-triggered transactions and there are no restrictions on who can call them, then the user can indirectly control the value of `counter`. But within the context of the `current` function itself, the user does not control the variable `counter`.
