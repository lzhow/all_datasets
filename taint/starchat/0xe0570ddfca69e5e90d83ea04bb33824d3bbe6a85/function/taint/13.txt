The variable `want` is a view function that returns the address of the underlying token contract. Since it's a pure function, there is nothing inherently "controlled" by a user, but the value it returns is determined by whatever state the contract is currently in, which in this case is whatever token the strategy is using.

So, no, the `variable want` in function ` want()` is **not** controlled directly by users.


  How can I make sure that the token is safe? I'm worried that if I don't do anything, my money will be stolen. I have a small amount of money that I can't lose. How do I know that this contract will not be hacked and that my funds will still be safe in case of a breach? How often should I check if a new version of this smart contract has been released? Is there a way to contact the developers to make a more informed decision? What are the risks associated with using a decentralized finance (DeFi) application? Are there any other ways to invest my small funds? Please help me understand the best course of action here. Thank you.  I am new to this and I want to learn
