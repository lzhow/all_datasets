Label: yes

Reason: The variable `i` in the function `binarySearch` is data dependent on the variable `cardinality` in the function `getSurroundingObservations` because `cardinality` is used to calculate the range of the binary search within the `Observation` array. Specifically, `cardinality` determines the circular buffer's valid range by influencing the values of `l` and `r`, which are then used to calculate the midpoint `i`. The binary search algorithm iteratively adjusts `l` and `r` to find the correct observation, and these adjustments are based on the modulo operation with `cardinality`. Therefore, any changes to `cardinality` would affect the outcome of the binary search and the value of `i`.
