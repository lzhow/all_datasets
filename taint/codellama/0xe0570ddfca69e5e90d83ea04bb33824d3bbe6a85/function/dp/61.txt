In the constructor function, the `_strategey` variable is assigned a value that is passed as an argument to the contract. This means that the value of `_stragety` is determined by the caller of the contructor function.
On the other hand, in `function` ` earnings`, the `available` function is called to get the balance of tokens that are available for transfer.  The `want` method is then called, which transfers the available tokens to a specified address. In this case, it is transferred to `address (stratety)`.
Since the address of `stratey`, which is a variable in constructor, is used in function earning, `_apporvaldelay` and `_ bal` are dependent on each other.
