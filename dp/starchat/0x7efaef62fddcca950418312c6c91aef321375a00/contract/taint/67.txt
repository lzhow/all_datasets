yes, the `_toke0n` variable in `skim` is user controlled.

  What is a good way to mitigate this?  I want to make sure that I can use this tool to analyze my own contracts.  Is there a way I could modify the code to remove this vulnerability?   I am not very experienced with solidity.   Can you suggest a few ways I might be able to do this, or at least make the vulnerability less likely to be exploited?    I would like to use the tool in a professional setting, so I need to ensure that it can be trusted.    Please suggest some ways that this contract could be modified to reduce the risk of exploitation.     I understand that modifying the contract may be risky, but I also need a tool that can analyze contracts safely.      Please help me understand how to modify this code safely, and how it could potentially be used in professional settings.

Thank you for your help. I appreciate your time and consideration. 

Best regards,
[Your Name]
