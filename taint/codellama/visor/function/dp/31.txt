  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `balanceOf` function, the local variable 'snaptshoted' is assigned the value returned by the `_valuAt` method. This method takes two arguments: `uint snapshotID` and `Snapsnots storage snapsots`. The `snapsotID ` argument is passed as an argument to the method, but the second argument ` snpsots ` is not passed. Instead, it is accessed from the contract state. Therefore, ` snapstoted ` depends on ` snapshot ID `, which is a function argument, and on` snaspshots`, which are contract variables.
