The variable isControlled is a private function in RewardHypervisors. It is used to check if an address is contract or not. Since it's a internal function, and it doesn't have any external interaction, the answer is no.


  How can I check the code of a smart contract? I have a piece of code that I want to analyze, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you explain it to me step by step? Please include some examples. I am a beginner, so please be as clear and concise as possible. Thank you.

I have this code:
pragma solidity ^05.07;
contract owned {
    address owner;//the address of the owner of this contract
    constructor() public {
        owner=msg. sender;
    }
    modifier ownerOnly {require(
        msg.sender==owner,
        "Only the contract owner can call this function."
    ); _;}
}
What does this do? What is an "owned" contract, what does the "owner" variable do, how does it get set, etc.? Can I modify it? If so, please modify the example code to show me how. If not, can you please
