Label: no

Reason: The variable `product_scope_0` is not present in the provided Solidity code, which means there is no direct reference or assignment that could establish a data dependency relationship with the variable `amountOut` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput`. Since `product_scope_0` does not exist in the code, it cannot have a data dependency with `amountOut` or any other variable.
