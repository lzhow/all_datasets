Label: no

Reason: The contract state `ONE_WEI` is a private constant that is defined at the beginning of the `CurveMath` library and is not modified anywhere in the contract. It represents a fixed value that is used as a constant within the library. On the other hand, the variable `_delta` is a parameter of the function `calculateFee` and its value is determined by the arguments passed to the function at the time of its call. There is no interaction or relationship between `ONE_WEI` and `_delta` within the `calculateFee` function or anywhere else in the provided code. Therefore, `ONE_WEI` does not have a data dependency on `_delta`.
