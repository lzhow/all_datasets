Reason: The variable `scaledMantissa` in the function `mulScalar` is calculated within the scope of that function using the parameters `a` and `scalar`. It is dependent on `a.mantissa` and `scalar` that are passed to `mulScalar` when it is called. On the other hand, the variable `b` in the function `mulExp3` is a separate parameter that is used within the scope of `mulExp3` to perform a multiplication with another `Exp` object `a`. There is no direct relationship or data flow between `scaledMantissa` and `b` as shown in the provided code snippet. They are used in different functions and there is no code indicating that `b` is passed to `mulScalar` or that `scaledMantissa` is used with `b`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
