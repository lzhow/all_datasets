Explanation: The variable `tokenIndex` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned a value based on the condition `withFactory ? 1 : 0`, where `withFactory` is a boolean variable determined by the length of `swapData.path`. The value of `withFactory` is not controlled by the user, and therefore the value of `tokenIndex` is also not controlled by the user.
