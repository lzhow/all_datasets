Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `redeemAmount` in the function `redeemUnderlying` is not directly used or referenced in the function `_callOptionalReturn`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between these two variables. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if the `data` variable is used to modify the state of the contract in a way that affects the value of `redeemAmount` indirectly. Without further information about the implementation of the `_callOptionalReturn` function, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
