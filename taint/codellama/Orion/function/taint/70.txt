  
No, the ` token B` variable in function `sortTokes` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` sortToken` function takes two token addresses as input, `address` `tokeA` and ` address` token `B`. The function then sorts the two addresses in ascending order and returns the sorted addresses.  The ` tokeB ` variable is a parameter of the sort token function and is therefore not user-controlled.
