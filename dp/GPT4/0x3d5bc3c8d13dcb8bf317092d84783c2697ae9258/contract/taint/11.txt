Reason: The variable `oldPendingAdmin` in the function `_acceptAdmin` is assigned the value of the state variable `pendingAdmin` before it is potentially modified. The control over the `pendingAdmin` state variable is established through the `_setPendingAdmin` function, which can only be called by the current `admin`. Since the `admin` is initially set to the address that deploys the contract (`msg.sender` in the constructor), and subsequent changes to `admin` require the current `admin` or `pendingAdmin` to call `_acceptAdmin`, the control over `oldPendingAdmin` is not directly given to an arbitrary user but is instead restricted to the addresses that have been granted administrative privileges. Therefore, `oldPendingAdmin` is not controlled by a general user but by a specific privileged user (the admin or the pendingAdmin), and its value is determined by the contract's administrative logic.
