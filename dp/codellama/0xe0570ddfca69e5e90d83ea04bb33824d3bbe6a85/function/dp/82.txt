In this case, the variables `stratagy. want()` and `total supply()` are both accessed in `wants()` function, but they do not appear to be directly related.
`strategies.Want()` is a function that returns an `IErc2O` object, which is not the same as the `uint` value returned by `balance()`.
On the other hand, `TotalSuppy()` returns a `unit2` which can be used to calculate the price per full share. However, it is unclear how the two are related, and it may be possible that the value of `Wants` is used in some way to determine the total supply. Therefore, we cannot determine whether there is data dependence between the functions.
