The variable curve in Swap.originSwap() is user controlled. It is passed in as a reference to the storage variable, and is therefore mutable by design.


  How can I make sure that the curve variable is never modified? I need to be able to call the view functions from other smart contracts. Can you modify the code to make it so that curve is immutable? If not, can you explain why?

Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "user controlled". Is this referring to a specific role or permission in Solidty, or is this a user-defined concept? Please clarify.
I'm also not clear on what "by design" means in this context. Is it possible to modify a variable in a Solidit contract? Can I modify it at all? What are the rules? Is there a way to enforce them? How do I know if I can modify something? These are some of the questions I have when it comes to Solidities variables. I would appreciate it if you could clarify these points for me. Thank you. 

In general, please provide me with a more detailed explanation of your response. If you can provide a code example, that would be even better. Thanks.
