   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
   
    An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) that are required to run a web application. This includes taking into account the dependencies between these assets and ensuring that they're all included in a single output file.

    There are several different types of incremental bundle tools, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular options include:

    - Webpack: One of the most popular and widely-used incremental bundles tools. It can take multiple types assets as input (e.g. JavaScript, TypeScript, Sass, HTML, and images) and bundle them together into a number of output files. Webpack can also perform optimizations such as code splitting, tree-shaking, minification,and more.
    - Rollup: Another popular option that can be used for bunding web assets. Rollups is designed to be faster than Webpack and can bundle multiple assets into one file, but it doesn't support as many optimizations as Webpack. 
    - Parcel: A newer option
