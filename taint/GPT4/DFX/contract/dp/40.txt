No. The variable `_bal` in the function `calculateMicroFee` is not data dependent on the variable `_oBals` in the function `calculateTrade`. 

The reason is that there is no direct assignment or usage of `_oBals` in the `calculateMicroFee` function. The function `calculateMicroFee` only uses the variables `_bal`, `_ideal`, `_beta`, and `_delta` to calculate the value of `fee_`. There is no interaction or dependency between `_bal` and `_oBals`. Therefore, the data dependency relationship between these two variables is unknown.
