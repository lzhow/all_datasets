  
No, the `_ total Supply ` variable in this function does not appear to be controlled directly by a user input. It is a state variable that is updated by calling the `m int` function, which is called by another function in a different contract. Therefore, this variable is considered to not be directly controlled  by user inputs.

The `_balanaces` variable, on the other hand, is directly updated in several functions, including `transfe r`, `appro ve`, and `increaseAllow ance`, which are all called directly from user-submitted transactions. This means that the balance of a particular address is potentially controlled or influenced by users.
