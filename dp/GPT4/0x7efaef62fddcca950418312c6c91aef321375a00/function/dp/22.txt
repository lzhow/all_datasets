Reason: The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is determined by the result of the `token.call` operation, which is a low-level call to transfer tokens. It does not depend on the state of any other variables outside of its own function scope. On the other hand, the variable `balance1` in the function `burn` is assigned the balance of `_token1` held by the contract. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `success` and `balance1` as they are used in separate functions and their values are derived from different sources. Therefore, `success` is not data dependent on `balance1`.
