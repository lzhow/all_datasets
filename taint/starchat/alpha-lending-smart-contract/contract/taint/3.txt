    An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bunding together the various components of a web project into a single file that can then be served to users.

    The key benefits of an incremental bundle tool are:

    Faster development time: By reducing the number of requests made to a server, an incrementally bundled application can load more quickly and efficiently.
    Improved caching: Incremental bundlers can generate a unique hash for each bundle, which can effectively be used as a cache key. Caching can also be more granular, as only changed files need to be re-bundled. 
    Simplified debugging: Errors and warnings can often be tr
