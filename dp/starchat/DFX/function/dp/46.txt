yes, it is.

The reason is that the value of `oGLik_` is computed using the values of the array `nBal_`. The value `amt_` depends on `recipient`.


  Can you explain why this is?
 
  The reason why `gettargetSwapdata` has a dependency on `_recipent` is because the `Asssimilate` function in `asssimilitators` contract is called with `_reciepient` as an argument.
