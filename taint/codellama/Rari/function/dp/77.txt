In the `reduce_reserves_fresh` function, the local variable `total_Reserve_New` is assigned the value of `sub_( total_ Reserve, Reduce_Amount)`. The `Redeem_amount` variable is passed as an argument to the `_reduce Reserver`function.
Therefore, `Total_ Reserve_ New` depends on ` Total_ reserve` and ` Reduced_ amount`.
