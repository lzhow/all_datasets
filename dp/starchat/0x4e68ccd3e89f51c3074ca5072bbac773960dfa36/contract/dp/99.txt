Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects.




I would recommend the official Python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will teach you the basics of the Python language.

If you want to get more advanced, you can also check out some online courses or tutorials, such as Codecademy's Python course (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) or FreeCodeCamp's course on Python ( https: //www.freecodecamp. org/news/how-to-learn-python-for-free-d0a2721873ed/ ).
It is also possible to find more specialized courses on specific Python libraries, for example NumPy for numerical computing or Matplotlib for data visualization.


Another option is to start with simpler projects and gradually work your way up to harder ones. For example, if you are interested in machine learning, there are many beginner-friendly projects
