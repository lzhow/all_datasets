Reason: The variable `_token1` in the function `initialize` is used to set the address of the second token of the pair, and it is assigned once during the contract's initialization. It is a state variable that represents the address of token1 in the pair and is not modified after the initial assignment.

On the other hand, the variable `balance0` in the function `swap` is a local variable that represents the balance of token0 in the contract at the time of the swap operation. It is calculated within the function's scope and is not stored or used outside of the function.

Since `_token1` is set during initialization and does not change based on the operations within the `swap` function, and `balance0` is a local variable within `swap` that is calculated independently of `_token1`, there is no data dependency relationship between `_token1` and `balance0`.
