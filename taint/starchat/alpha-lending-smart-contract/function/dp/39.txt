The function signature is:

`function calculateBorrowInterest(address _reserve, uint _balance, bool _isFirstBorrow) external returns(uint);`
This function calculates the interest accrued by a user's borrow balance.
`_reserve` is an address representing the reserve the balance is associated with. `_balance` represents the user balance in that reserve. `isBorrowFirst` indicates if this is a new borrow or an existing one.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please rephrase your question?
 
  Data dependency is when one variable or state is dependent on another. For example, if you have two functions that both use a variable, then the two function are dependent upon that variable. If you change the value of the dependent variable in one function, it will also change in another function that is depedent upon it. This is because the functions are both referencing the same memory location. In the case of Solidty, this means that if one contract function modifies a state variable that another contract is also dependent, the second contract will be recompiled and redeployed. 

In the example you gave, `pool
