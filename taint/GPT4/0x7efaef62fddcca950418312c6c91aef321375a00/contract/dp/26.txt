The contract state `balanceOf` is data dependent on the variable `liquidity` in the function `mint`. In the `mint` function, `liquidity` is calculated based on the amounts of token0 and token1 added to the pool, and then the `_mint` internal function is called with `liquidity` as an argument. The `_mint` function, in turn, updates the `balanceOf` mapping for the address `to` by adding the `liquidity` amount to the current balance. This establishes a direct data dependency relationship between `balanceOf` and `liquidity`, as the value of `liquidity` directly influences the resulting value of `balanceOf[to]`.
