Explanation: The variable `pair` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is data dependent on the variable `tokenB` in the same function because the value of `tokenB` is used as an argument when calling the `getPair` function, which assigns the returned value to `pair`. Therefore, any change in the value of `tokenB` will affect the value of `pair`.
