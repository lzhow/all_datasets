  
The variable 'position' in function 'get' is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the 'Position' struct is defined in a library, and the library is imported from another file. Therefore, the struct definition is unknown to the analysis program.
Additionally, since the get function is marked as internal, which means that it can only be accessed within the same contract, there is no way for the program to determine whether the position variable is user-controlled or not.
