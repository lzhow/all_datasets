The variable `protocolFeeSignature` in the function `execute` is controlled by the user because it is passed as an argument to the function when it is called. In Solidity, the data that is passed to a function via its parameters is provided by the caller of the function. In this case, the caller is the user who is interacting with the smart contract, and they have the ability to provide any `ProtocolFeeSignature` data structure they choose when they call the `execute` function. Therefore, the `protocolFeeSignature` variable is user-controlled.
