   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I have heard that it is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I also heard it can be difficult to maintain code written in Python. What do you think? Is there something I can do to help me learn Python more effectively? Please let me know if you need any more information. Thank you.

I am a sophomore studying computer science. My goal is to work as a software engineer after graduation. In my free time, I like to play video games, watch anime, and read manga. As for experience with programming, none. 

Please let my know how I may be able to improve my Python skills. If there are any coding resources that you would recommend, please let them know as well.  Thank You.
 
Sincerely,
