  
No, the variables `_ x` and ` y` are independent.

The reason is that the `_ _ x_` variable is only used in a loop that iterates over the `xp_ _` array, and the loop does not depend on ` _ y`. The loop only depends on `_ i` which is a local variable that is not related to `x`.
Also, ` x _ ` is passed as an argument to the get _ D function, which does depend only on x and not on y. Therefore, there is no data dependence between `_ X`and `Y`.
