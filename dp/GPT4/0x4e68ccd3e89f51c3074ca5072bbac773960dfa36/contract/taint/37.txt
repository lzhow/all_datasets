Explanation: The variable `liquidity` in the function `transform` is not controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. The function `transform` performs calculations using the `liquidity` parameter, but it does not allow the user to directly control or modify the value of `liquidity`.
