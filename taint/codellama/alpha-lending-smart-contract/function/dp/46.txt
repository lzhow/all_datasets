In the first function, the `suppy` variable is calculated using the balance of the contract's alpha token balance.
Then, `total share` is subtracted from the `_ share`.
Finally, `_amount ` is set to the result of multiplying `_ amount` by `withdraPortions` and dividing it by 10^16.  The `alphaToken` balance is used to calculate the amount. Therefore, it is dependent on `_ Share`.
