Yes

The variable `nextWeekBlock` in the function `getReleaseAmount` is data dependent on the variable `_block` in the function `findNextWeekFirstBlock`. This is because `nextWeekBlock` is assigned the return value of the call to `findNextWeekFirstBlock(fromBlock)`, where `fromBlock` is an argument derived from the input parameters `_fromBlock` and `_toBlock` of the `getReleaseAmount` function. The `findNextWeekFirstBlock` function takes `_block` as an argument and performs calculations based on it to determine the first block of the next week. Since `nextWeekBlock` is directly affected by the output of `findNextWeekFirstBlock`, which in turn is dependent on its input `_block`, there is a data dependency relationship between `nextWeekBlock` and `_block`.
