The variable `admin` in the function `True` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The `admin` variable is initially set to the `msg.sender` in the constructor, which means it is set to the address of the contract deployer. The contract deployer is not necessarily the user, but the entity deploying the contract. Therefore, the `admin` variable is not controlled by the user.
