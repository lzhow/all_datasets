In the `functionStaticCall` function within the provided Solidity code, the variable `success` is directly dependent on the variable `target`. This is because `success` is assigned the result of a `staticcall` to the address contained in `target`. The `staticcall` is an EVM opcode that performs a message call to another contract (specified by `target`) without any possibility of modifying the state. The `success` variable captures whether this call was successful or not, which inherently depends on the address referred to by `target` and the data passed to it. If `target` is not a contract or the call to the contract fails for some reason, `success` will be `false`; otherwise, it will be `true`. Thus, there is a data dependency relationship between `success` and `target`.
