There is no direct data dependence between the two functions. However, there is an indirect data flow between them.
In the `buyerER165` function, the `_tokenAdress` parameter is used to call the` safeTranserFrom` method of the ERC-121 contract. This method is defined in another contract, which is not provided in this code snippet. Therefore, it is unknown whether the contract state of this contract is data-dependent on `satrtedat` or not.
