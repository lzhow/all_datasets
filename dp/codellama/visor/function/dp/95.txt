  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to the burn function to only the owner of the smart contract. This means that the `_burn` function can only be called by the address that deployed the Smrt contract, which is not the same as the account that is being burned. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the state of `_allownces` and the amount variable in this function.
