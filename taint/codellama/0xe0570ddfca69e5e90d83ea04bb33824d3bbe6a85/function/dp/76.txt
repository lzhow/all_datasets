In the constructor function, the `_name` and `_approvedDelay` variables are passed as arguments to the `ERC-2O` constructor, which initializes the state variables `_NAME`and `_APPROVAL_DELAY`. The `_SYMBOL` variable is not passed to any function or constructor in this code snippet, so it is independent of the other variables and contracts. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the variables.
