Label: no

Reason: The variable `b` in the function `tryMul` and the variable `a` in the function `mod` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. In Solidity, function parameters are local to the function and do not have a data dependency relationship with parameters of other functions unless they are passed by reference or there is an explicit relationship established through the contract's state variables or function calls. Since `tryMul` and `mod` are both pure functions and there is no interaction between them within the provided code, there is no data dependency between `b` in `tryMul` and `a` in `mod`. Each function operates independently, and the variables are not related to each other in any way within the context of this code.
