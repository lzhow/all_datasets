The variable `_owner` in the function `True` is not controlled by the user.

Reason: The variable `_owner` is declared as private, which means it can only be accessed within the contract itself. It is set in the constructor of the `Ownable` contract, which is called upon contract deployment. The ownership can be transferred by the contract owner using the `transferOwnership` function, but this function can only be called by the current owner (as enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier). Therefore, the control of the `_owner` variable is limited to the contract owner and not the user.
