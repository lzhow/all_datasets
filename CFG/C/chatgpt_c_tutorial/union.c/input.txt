You are a C Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  C code file. You give me its 
    AST in Json. Each AST node only has three attributes, children, type and value.

    The input file is 
    ```
    union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};

int main() {
    union Data data;
    data.i = 10;
    return 0;
}

    ```
