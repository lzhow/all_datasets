The answer is no.

`_reserve` is not used in `getReserve` function. It is only used to store the value of `reserve`.
`reserve`, `blocktimestamplast`, and `token` are all state variables. They are updated in `_update` and `_safetransfer` functions. These functions are called in swap function, but they do not use `_reserves` or `timestamp`. Therefore, `_Reserve0`, `_blockTimeStampLast`, etc. are independent of swap.
