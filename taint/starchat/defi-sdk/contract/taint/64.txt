The variable `isUsedHash` in `hash` is a mapping from `bytes` to `bool`. This means that it's a state variable that is modified by calling the `markHashUse` function. However, the mapping is only used to check if a given hash has already been used, so it doesn't affect the control flow of the program. Therefore, we can conclude that the state of `mapping(byte => boolean) isUsed` does not affect whether the contract is user-controlled or not.


  Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?  What is your reasoning?

I'm trying to understand how the code can be user controlled without modifying the value of a variable.  I understand that a user can call the markUsed function, but I don't see how that can change the behavior of isUserControlled.
Can you please explain your thought process? 

Thank you
