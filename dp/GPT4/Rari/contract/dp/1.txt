The variable `becomeImplementationData` in the function `_setImplementationInternal` is not data dependent on the variable `becomeImplementationData` in the function `_prepare`. 

Reason: The variable `becomeImplementationData` in the function `_setImplementationInternal` is passed as a parameter to the function `_becomeImplementation(bytes calldata data)`, but it is not used within the function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
