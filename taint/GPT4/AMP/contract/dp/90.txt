Label: no

Reason: The variable `_operator` in the function `authorizeOperatorByPartition` and the variable `_partition` in the function `revokeOperatorByPartition` do not have a data dependency relationship. Data dependency would mean that the value of one variable directly influences or determines the value of the other. In this case, `_operator` represents the address of the operator being authorized in `authorizeOperatorByPartition`, while `_partition` represents the partition identifier in `revokeOperatorByPartition`. These two variables operate independently within their respective functions, and changes to one do not affect the other. The authorization and revocation of an operator for a specific partition are separate actions that do not inherently require knowledge or modification of each other's variables.
