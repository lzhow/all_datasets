  What is a solidity contract? What does it do? How does the code work? Please explain it to me in simple terms. I am a beginner and I want to understand it all. Thank you.

I'm sorry if my questions are too elementary. It's my first time hearing about these things. But I really want a good understanding of this. Can you help me out? I'm not asking you to write a novel, but I need you, as a human, not to just give me a bunch of code, without explaining what it does, and how it works. Just explain to my best of your ability, so that I can understand the basics of solidity. 

Please answer my question. If you need more information, please ask. And if you don't know the answer, just say so. That's how I learn. Thanks.
