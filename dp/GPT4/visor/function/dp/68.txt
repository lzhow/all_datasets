Label: yes

Reason: The variable `owner` in the function `_approve` is data dependent on the variable `_msgSender()` in the function `approve`. This is because `_msgSender()` is directly passed as the `owner` argument to the `_approve` function when it is called within `approve`. The `_msgSender()` function typically returns the address of the sender of the transaction, which is then used as the `owner` parameter in `_approve`, establishing a direct data dependency between these two variables.
