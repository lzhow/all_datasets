The variable `nGLiq_` in the function `getOriginSwapData` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `nGLiq_` is calculated based on the values of `oBals_` and `nBals_`, which are both derived from the `curve.assets` array. The `curve.assets` array is a storage variable that is not controlled by the user. Therefore, the value of `nGLiq_` is not directly influenced by user input.
