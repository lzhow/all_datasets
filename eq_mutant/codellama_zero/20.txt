  
No. They are NOT sematically equal because of the difference in the line `double diff=x *x -N;` and ` double  diff  =x  *  x  --  -  N;`
In the first code, `diff` will be assigned the value of ` x^2 - n`. In the second code ` diff`  will  be  assigned  the  value  of  ` (x^  (2  +  n))  /  2 `.
Therefore, they do not have  same  meaning.
