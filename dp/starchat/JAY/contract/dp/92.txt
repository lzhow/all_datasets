yes, the symbol is data-dependent on ercs1.5.

The reason is that the `_mint` function in `Jaya.sol` is called with the `msgSender` as the first parameter, which is a state variable.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  The `_burn` and `_transfer` functions in OpenZeppelin's `ERC223.solidity` contract are called in two different places in Jaya's smart contract. In the case of `_buyERC`, the token is transferred from the Jay contract to the buyer. This is an example of a transfer of ownership. However, in `_sell`, it is not the owner that is transferring the tokens, but the seller, who is calling the transfer function. Therefore, it does not follow that this state is dependent on `ids`.
