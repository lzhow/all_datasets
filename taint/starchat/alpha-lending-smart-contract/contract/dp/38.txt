The contract has a function called `stake` that transfers `_amount` of `alphaTokens` from `msg sender` to `this address`. The function then mints `_shares` proportionally to `_amout` and sends them to msg sender.

In the `Unstake function`, the `_burn` function reduces the total supply of `_shres` by `_shared`.
If the address of the vestiging alpha is  `0`, then the reward is sent to  msg Sender.  Otherwise the alpha token is approved to be sent by the Vesting Alpha contract to its balance of msg Snder.
