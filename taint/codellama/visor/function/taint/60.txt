The variable `account` in `balanceOf` is a function parameter, which means that it can be controlled only by external users who call the `transer` function. It is passed as an argument to ` balanceof` and is used to retrieve the balance of the specified account. Therefore, the value of ` account` cannot be changed by any internal code within the contract.
