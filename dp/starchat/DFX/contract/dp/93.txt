   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and not having any real understanding of how programming works.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I'm completely new to programming and would like to start learning as soon as possible. I have heard that Python is easy to pick up and has a large amount of resources available, so I want to make sure I choose something that will help me learn. Can you recommend some beginner-friendly Python resources? Thank you!

  
  Python can be a great language to begin with if you're new in programming. It's easy and intuitive to read and write code, and it has many libraries and frameworks available to help you build powerful applications. Here are the resources that I found helpful when I started learning Python:

1. **Python for Beginners:** This is an online course offered by Microsoft that teaches you the basics of Python programming in a fun and interactive way.

2.  **Automate the Boring Stuff with python:**  This book teach you how you can use Python to automate boring tasks
