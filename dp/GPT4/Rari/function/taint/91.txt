Explanation: 

The variable `scalar` in the function `mulScalarTruncateAddUInt` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, but its value is not determined by user input within the contract. Therefore, it cannot be classified as either controlled or not controlled by the user.
