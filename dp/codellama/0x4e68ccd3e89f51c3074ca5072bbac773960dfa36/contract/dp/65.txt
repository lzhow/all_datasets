  
No, the ` self` variable in function  ` update` is not  data-dependent on  the  variable  'maxliqudity' in  function 'update'.

The reason is that the 'self' variable is a mapping of type 'int  to TICk.info' which is defined outside the scope of the update function. Therefore, it is independent of any local variables defined within the body of update.
