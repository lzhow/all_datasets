Explanation: The variable `_amount` in the function `transferFrom` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, and its value is determined by the caller of the function. Without further context or information about how the value of `_amount` is obtained, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not.
