Reason: The contract state `_indexOfTotalPartitions` is a mapping that keeps track of the index of each partition in the `_totalPartitions` array. It is used to manage the list of all partitions that have been defined within the contract.

The variable `_data` in the function `_transferByPartition` is a bytes array that can contain arbitrary data and is intended to be used for passing extra information with a transfer. This data could be used to influence the behavior of the transfer, such as specifying a different partition to transfer tokens to.

However, `_indexOfTotalPartitions` is not directly modified based on the contents of `_data`. The `_data` variable is used within the `_callPreTransferHooks` and `_callPostTransferHooks` functions to potentially influence the behavior of token transfers, but it does not have a direct impact on the state of `_indexOfTotalPartitions`. The `_indexOfTotalPartitions` mapping is only modified when partitions are added or removed, which is not directly controlled by the `_data` variable.

Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_indexOfTotalPartitions` and `_data` within the `_transferByPartition` function.
