The variable weht is a state variable in this contract. It is used to store the address of the WETH token contract, and is set in a constructor. Since the constructor is executed only once, the value of weath_ is fixed and cannot be changed by any function. Therefore, we can conclude that the state of this variable is "controlled by user".
