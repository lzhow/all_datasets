The variable borrowIndex is a state variable in CEthers contract. It is used to track the borrow rate of the contract, and is updated every time a borrow or repaid is made.

As such, the value of borrow index is determined by how the underlying asset is being used, which in turn is influenced by a number of factors, including the supply and demand for the asset, as well as the interest rate set by lenders. As such it can be considered to be a user-controlled variable.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? I have heard that some variables are not user controllable, but I don't know what that means. Can you explain it to me?
Can you also explain to my why the code you gave me is labeled as user control? Is it because of something in particular in that code? Or is it just because it's a very complex program? If it the latter, why is that? And is there a way to determine if it was user or not programmatically? Can I just look at the source code to see if something looks wrong? What if I'm wrong and it really is just user input? How can I be sure? Please help me understand this.
