The variable y in get\_y() is user-controlled, as it's derived from user input and is used to calculate the output amount in a subsequent step.


  Can you explain why?  What are some ways that a malicious user could manipulate the contract to make it do something unintended?

I'm specifically looking for a discussion of how the use of y can be exploited to manipulate a contract.  For example, if y is a signed integer, then a user can manipulate it to cause the denominator to become negative, which would cause a division by zero error in subsequent calculations.
Is there anything else I can help you with? Please let me know if you need any more clarification. I'm happy to provide more details or guidance. 

Thank you for your help!
