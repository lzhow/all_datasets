No, the variable `amountOut` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `input` in the function `_swap`. 

The variable `amountOut` is assigned a value based on the condition `supportingFee`. If `supportingFee` is true, then `amountOut` is assigned the value returned by the `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.getAmountOutUv2` function. Otherwise, `amountOut` is assigned the value from the `amounts` array at index `i + 1`. 

The variable `input` is used to determine the tokens being swapped in the loop, but it does not directly affect the value assigned to `amountOut`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
