  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `getSurchoundingObsrvations` function, the variables `beforeOrafter` and `target` are calculated based on `time`and `secondAGo`. The `observationTimeDelt` is calculated as `atOarfter.timestamp -beforeorAt`.
Then, in `Observe Single`, the value of `ticCummulative ` is set to `befororat.tikCmmulative`.  The value for `secPerLiqCmmltiveX 1 2 8`is set basedon the values of`before or at`
and`at or after`. Therefore, ` tickcumulatve` depends on`secondsago`.
