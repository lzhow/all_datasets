Reason: The variable `data` in the function `_safeTransfer` is a local variable that is assigned the result of a low-level `call` to an external contract (or token). It is used to ensure that the token transfer was successful. On the other hand, the variable `feeOn` in the function `_mintFee` is a local variable that is determined by the state of the `feeTo` address and the `_kLast` variable. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `data` and `feeOn` as they are used in separate functions for different purposes and do not share state or influence each other's values. The `_safeTransfer` function does not read from or write to any of the variables that affect `feeOn`, nor does `_mintFee` read from or write to `data`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
