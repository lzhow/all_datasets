The contract function is:

function transferfrom(address src address, address dest address2, uint amount uint) public returns(bool);
It is not clear what the relationship is between the two addresses and the amount.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the totalReservations state variable is data-dependent on both the src and dest addresses, and on amount, because the transfer function updates the balances of both addresses based on their contributions to the reserves.
Can you explain why this is so?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I have heard that it is important to practice a lot, but I don't know where to start. Could you recommend a few websites or apps where I can do that? Also, are there any languages that are easier to get started with? For example, is it better to do Java or C++ first because they have more tutorials available? Or should I start with Python because it's the most popular? Thank you!
   Learning to program in Python can be a great way for anyone interested in coding to improve their skills and become a more efficient and productive programmer.
