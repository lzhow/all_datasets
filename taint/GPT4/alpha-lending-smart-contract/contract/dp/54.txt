Label: no

Reason: The variable `_rateSlope2` in the constructor function is used to initialize the state variable `rateSlope2`. The function `getLiquidationBonusPercent` returns the state variable `liquidationBonusPercent`. There is no interaction or dependency between `rateSlope2` and `liquidationBonusPercent` within the contract code. Each of these variables is used independently of the other, and the value of one does not affect or determine the value of the other. Therefore, `_rateSlope2` is not data dependent on the variable `liquidationBonusPercent`.
