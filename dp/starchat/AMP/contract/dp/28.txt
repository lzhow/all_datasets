yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_callTransferPreHooks` function calls the `tokensTransferred` method on any contract that implements the IAMPTokensValidator interface. This method takes the from and to addresses as parameters, and the _values parameter. If the to address is a contract, then the contract will be able to read the state of the "from" address, which could be undesirable.


  How can I fix this?
 
  You can fix the issue by making sure that any contracts that implement the tokensTransfer method are trusted and not malicious. One way to do this is to check that a certain number of ether is sent with the transaction, or that certain conditions are met. Additionally, you can use a tool like Slither to automatically check for issues like this. Slitherr is an open-source static analysis framework for Solidty code that can help you find and fix security vulnerabilities. It can also be used to find data-dependent bugs like the one you're experiencing. To use Sliter, follow these steps:

1. Install Slitter: You'll need to install Slinter using npm. Run the command npm install -g slither-analyzer.
