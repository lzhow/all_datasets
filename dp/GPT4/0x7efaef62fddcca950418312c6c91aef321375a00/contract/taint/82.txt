Reason: The variable `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is declared as a public constant with a predefined value and cannot be altered by the user. It is set at the time of contract deployment and remains constant throughout the lifetime of the contract. Users cannot modify this value through any function or transaction, hence it is not controlled by the user.
