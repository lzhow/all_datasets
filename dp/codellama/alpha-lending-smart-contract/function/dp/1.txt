  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the ` decode U8` function, the value of the local variable 'data' is passed as an argument to the internal function 'shift'. The ' shift' function modifies the ' data' variable by shifting its value to  the left by 8 bits. This means that the data in 'decode U2' will be modified by the same amount as the shift function is called. Therefore, ' decode u8' depends on 'decod u2'.
