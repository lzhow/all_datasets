  
No, the variables `_updatePositions` and `liqudity` are independent.

The variable  `_fieGrothGloba0x102` is a state variable of the contract and is not directly dependent on any input variable. It is updated in a different function `_updatPosition` which is called in `update` function.  The variable`liqudiy` on other hand is an input parameter of `Swaps`function and it is directly dependant on `amoutSpecifed` variable which in turn is depedent on input parameters of`swap` functions. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
