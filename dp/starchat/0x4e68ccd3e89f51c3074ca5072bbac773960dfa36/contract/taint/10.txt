The variable amount out in getNextSquarePricefromOutput() is a result of a calculation and is therefore not directly controlled or influenced by user input. However, the calculation is based on user inputs such as sqrtPriceX9 and liqudity.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand your answer. Could you please explain it again? What is "a result"?
  
  The variable "amount out" in function "getNextSquarePricfromOut()" is calculated based off of the other variables such a sqrtPx9, and Liquidity. It is then returned as a uint 90 and not a user controlled variable.

I apologize if my previous response was unclear. Let me know if you have any other questions. I am here to help. 

Thank you
