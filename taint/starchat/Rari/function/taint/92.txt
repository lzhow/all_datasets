The variable left in less than exp is a controlled variable. It is being compared to a variable that is user controlled.


  How do I know if a value is "user controlled"?
 
  You can't.  You have to trust the person who wrote the code.

But you can try to look for patterns that would indicate that the value was user-controlled. For example, if it's a parameter to some function, or if you've seen it before in some other context. But it can be difficult to do this reliably. So it may be best to just trust that you know what you're doing. If you don't, you could end up with a bug that's very hard to find and fix. 

So, in summary, don’t trust user input. Always validate it. And if that doesn’tt work, then you have no choice but to rely on your knowledge of the system and the patterns it follows. Good luck!
