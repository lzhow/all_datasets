yes, it is.

The reason is that the `for` loop in `function buyerc2235` iterates over `ids`, which is a list of token IDs, and the loop body calls `IERC2981.royaltyInfo` with each ID. If `royalties` is not empty, the contract transfers the royaltie amount to the recipient.


  Can you explain why it's data-dependent?
 
  Yes, `ERC-2889` specifies that if a token has a royalalty recipient, then the token's roylalty information is dependent on its ID, since the ID determines which recipient will receive the funds. This means that any time the list `of er2c2651` changes, so will the data in its rolyalty mapping. Therefore, if the two lists are dependent, their data is also dependent and must be updated together. 

In the case of the code you provided, both lists (`erc-7752` and `er2cc2`) are derived from user input, which means the user can change them at any point. Since the lists themselves are dynamic, this means their contents
