  
No, the ` EC _5  _TRANFER _SUCCES` variable is a constant defined in a library and is therefore not user-controlled.

The reason for this is that the value of this variable does not depend on any user input or state, and it does no computation or processing. It is simply a predefined value that is used as a return value for the transfer function. Therefore, this value is considered to be controlled internally by Solc and not by a user of the contract.
