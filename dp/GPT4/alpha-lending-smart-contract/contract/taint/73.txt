Label: no

Reason: The variable `_NOT_ENTERED` is a private constant within the `ReentrancyGuard` contract. It is set to a constant value of `1` and cannot be modified by the user or any other part of the contract after the contract is deployed. Since it is a constant, its value is fixed at compile time and it is not subject to change by any external interaction. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
