Reason: The variable `swapData` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is data dependent on the variable `curBalance_scope_0` within the same function. This is because `curBalance_scope_0` is assigned a value based on the balance of a token at an address that is determined by the `path` property of `swapData`. Specifically, `curBalance_scope_0` is used to calculate the difference in token balance before and after a transfer, which is a part of the swap operation. The swap operation itself is defined by the parameters within `swapData`, such as the `amountIn`, `path`, and other properties that dictate how the swap should be executed. Therefore, the value of `curBalance_scope_0` is directly influenced by the contents of `swapData`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
