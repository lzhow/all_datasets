The two provided codes aren't semanticallly equal as they don't do the exact same thing. The first code swaps two elements only if one of the elements is larger than the other one, whereas the second code does the swap regardless of whether the condition is met or not, causing the final result to be different.

Thus, the provided C code is **not** semanticlly equal to the Java code.
