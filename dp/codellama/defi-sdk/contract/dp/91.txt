  
No, the ` swap Type` variable in `callBytes` is not dependent on ` i` because ` get Amounts In` function is called before ` call Bytes` and the value of ` Swaptype` does not change.

The `Swap Type ` variable is defined as a constant in this contract and is passed as an argument to the` getAmounIn` method. Therefore, it is independent of the loop variable` i`.
