   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. Also mention the pros and cons of using an incremental bundlers. I would appreciate if you could also compare it with other popular bundling tools. Thank you!
  
   An incremental bundle tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, etc. into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This makes it easier and faster for the browser to load the application and make it more responsive.

   Pros:
   - Faster page loads
   – Less data being transferred over the network
   + Easier debugging
   * Better code splitting
   % Better compression

   Cons:
    - Initial bundle can take longer to generate
    – Larger bundle size
    + Potential for bugs in code that only manifests in production
