Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_allowedByPartition` in the function `transferFrom` is data dependent on the variable `_allowedByPartition` in the function `approveByPartition`. In the `transferFrom` function, `_allowedByPartition` is used to check and potentially decrease the allowance of a spender for a particular partition of tokens owned by a token holder. The `approveByPartition` function is used to set or change this allowance. Therefore, any change to the allowance made by `approveByPartition` will affect the checks and behavior of `transferFrom` when it comes to transferring tokens on behalf of the token holder. This establishes a clear data dependency relationship between the two variables, as they both refer to the same mapping and the state of one is influenced by the other.
