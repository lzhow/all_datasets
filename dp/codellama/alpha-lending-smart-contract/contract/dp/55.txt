Explanation:
In the `mIntAltoken` function, the `_token`, `_amount`, and `_user` variables are passed as arguments. However, in `calcuate RoundUp LiquidtySharAmount External` , only `_ token` and ` _ amount` are used as parameters. Therefore, `_ recipient ` is not dependent on `_ user` in this function.
