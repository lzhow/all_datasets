  
No, the ` y` variable in function `get _y()` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it doesn't have any user input.

The ` get _ y()` function is a pure function, which means that it does not modify the state of the contract, and all its inputs are passed as arguments. Therefore, there is no user interaction with the smart contract that could affect the value of `x` or `xp`.
