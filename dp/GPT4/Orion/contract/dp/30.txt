No, the variable `pair` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is not data dependent on the variable `tokenAOrWETH` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `pair` is assigned the value of `IOrionPoolV2Factory(factory).getPair(tokenAOrWETH, tokenB)`, where `tokenAOrWETH` is the value of `tokenA` or `WETH`. The value of `tokenAOrWETH` is determined outside the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` and does not depend on the value of `tokenAOrWETH` within the function. Therefore, the data dependency between `pair` and `tokenAOrWETH` is unknown.
