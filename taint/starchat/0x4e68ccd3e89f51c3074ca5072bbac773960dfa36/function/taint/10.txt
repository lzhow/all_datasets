The variable self in function `binarySearch` is a reference to an array of `Observation` structs, which is declared as a storage array. Since the array is stored on the blockchain, and its elements are modified by calling the `transform` function, the elements of the self array are also considered to be controlled indirectly by users of this contract.


  Can you explain how the control flow of that function relates to the input parameters?  What is being modified in each step of control?

Also, can you describe the overall control-flow of your program? What are the entry points and exit points? How are variables passed between them? Is there any notion of memory or call-stack? Are there loops or recursion? If so, how are they handled? Etc.
I'm trying to understand how your tool works, but I'm having a hard time following the code without a proper understanding of how it works. Can I get a high-level overview of what your algorithm does? I'd also appreciate a more detailed explanation of each function. I understand that Solidty is an imperative language, so I can understand the logic of it, I just need a better understanding on how to use your analysis. Thanks!
