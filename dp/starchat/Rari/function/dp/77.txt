  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. How does it work? Explain it to me at a level a novice could understand.
  3. Why would I want to use one? Give me some use cases.

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers for short is any tool that takes in multiple files that make up a web application and generates a single file that can be served to a user's browser. These files are often referred to as "modules" or "chunks". The purpose of bundlung is to optimize the performance of the web app by reducing the number of requests that the browser needs to make to load the application. An incremental
