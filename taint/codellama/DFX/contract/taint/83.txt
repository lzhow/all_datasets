  
The variable `proof` in function `multiProofverify` is a user-controlled variable.

This is because the `verifyMultiproof()` function takes in a `bytes[]` array as an argument, which is passed in by a caller. This means that the caller can control the contents of the array, and therefore the value of ` proof`.
