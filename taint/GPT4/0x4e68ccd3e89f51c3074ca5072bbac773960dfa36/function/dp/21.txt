Label: yes

Reason: The variable `last` in the function `transform` is directly assigned a value from the array `self` in the function `write` with the expression `Observation memory last = self[index];`. This indicates that the state of `last` is dependent on the contents of `self` at the specified `index`. When `self[index]` is passed to `transform`, any changes or values in `self[index]` will affect the computation and the resulting value of `last` within `transform`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `last` and `self`.
