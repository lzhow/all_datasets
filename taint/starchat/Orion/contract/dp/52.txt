yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_factories` array is updated in `updateFactories`, which is called by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that any function that calls `Poolfunctionality` must be called from the owner account. This means the value of `_amount` can be influenced by any call to `updatFactories`.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  The reason why the data-dependence relationship exists between the two is due to the order of operations in Solidty. When a function in a Solidit contract is executed, the code in that function executes from top to bottom, line by line. In the case of the constructor function, Solidiy will first set the initial value for the _amount variable, then execute the body of code inside the curly braces, and finally set a value to _factor.
