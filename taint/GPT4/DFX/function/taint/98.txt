The variable `_deposit` in the function `viewDeposit` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `_deposit` is a function parameter and its value is passed as an argument when calling the function. The user does not have control over the value of this variable as it is determined by the caller of the function. Therefore, the variable `_deposit` is not controlled by the user.
