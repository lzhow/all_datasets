Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `_beta` in the function `calculateMicroFee` is not directly used or referenced in the function `calculateTrade`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `_beta` and `_oGLiq`. However, there could be an indirect data dependency if `_beta` affects the state of the contract or the values of other variables that are used in `calculateTrade`. Without further information about the relationship between `_beta` and the rest of the contract, it is not possible to determine the data dependency between `_beta` and `_oGLiq` with certainty. Hence, the label is unknown.
