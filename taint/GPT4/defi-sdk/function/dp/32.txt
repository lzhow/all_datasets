yes

The variable `amountIn` is data dependent on the variable `numerator` in the function `getAmountOut`. The reason is that `numerator` is directly calculated using `amountInWithFee`, which in turn is calculated by multiplying `amountIn` by a constant (997). This means that any change in the value of `amountIn` will directly affect the value of `amountInWithFee`, and consequently, the value of `numerator`. Therefore, there is a clear data dependency relationship between `amountIn` and `numerator`.
