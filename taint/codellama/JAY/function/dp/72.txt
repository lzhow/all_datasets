  
No, the variables ` er c1 5 6Token Address` and ` answered In Round` are independent.

The reason is that the `buyjay` function does not use the` answeredinround` variable, and the updatefees function only updates the value of the answered in round variable. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
