The contract function is `onlyOwner`, which means that it can only be called by the owner of the smart contract. Therefore, the variables `curve`, `alpha`, `_beta`, and `fee` are all constant and do not affect the behavior of `Orchestrator`.

However, `epsilon`, on line 6, is a state variable that is updated in `updateState`, a function that can be invoked by anyone. This means there is potential for a race condition where the value of epsilon is changed after the check on `msg.sender == owner`, but before the update to `state`.


 1. Is the `owner` variable data-dependent on any other variables in this function? If so, what are they?
 2. If the answer to (1) is no, then is it data dependendent on other functions?

  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that
