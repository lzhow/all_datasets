Reason: The variable `pending` in the function `claimCurrentAlphaReward` is not directly controlled by the user. It is calculated within the function based on the difference between the `alphaMultiplier` and the `latestAlphaMultiplier[_account]`, multiplied by the balance of `_account`, and then divided by `1e12`. The `alphaMultiplier` is updated by the `receiveAlpha` function, which is called by the lending pool, not directly by the user. The `latestAlphaMultiplier[_account]` is updated within the `claimCurrentAlphaReward` function itself, which is called by various functions in the contract that are either internal or have the `onlyOwner` modifier, meaning they are not directly accessible to arbitrary users. The balance of `_account` (`balanceOf(_account)`) is dependent on the user's interactions with the contract (such as transferring tokens), but the user does not have direct control over the `pending` variable's value within the `claimCurrentAlphaReward` function. The calculation also includes a check against the balance of the AlphaToken held by the contract, which is not directly controlled by the user. Therefore, the user does not have direct control over the `pending` variable; it is determined by the contract's logic and state.
