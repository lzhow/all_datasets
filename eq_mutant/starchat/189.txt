No. It is impossible to determine if these two programs are functionally equivalent. There is no way to predict the exact behavior of these programs, as the inputs and conditions may vary. Even if you know the input values and the program's conditional statements, there may be hidden dependencies or other factors that affect program behavior. Therefore it is inappropriate to say that these codes semantic equal, even if their behavior appears to be identical at first glance.
