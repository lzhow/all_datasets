The variable `a` in the function `trySub` and the variable `b` in the function `tryMul` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. They are not dependent on each other because each function has its own local scope, and the parameters are passed by value, not by reference. Therefore, changes to `b` in `tryMul` do not affect `a` in `trySub`, and vice versa. Each function call is independent, and the variables within those calls do not share state or influence each other outside of their function scope.
