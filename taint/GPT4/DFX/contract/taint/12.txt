Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `_baseCurrency` in the function `getCurve` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as a parameter to the function, but there is no indication in the code provided that the value of `_baseCurrency` is influenced or controlled by the user. Therefore, the label is unknown.
