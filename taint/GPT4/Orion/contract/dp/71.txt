Reason: The variable `curFactory` in the function `pairFor` is used to determine the address of the pair for two given tokens. It is a parameter of the function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. It is used solely for the purpose of identifying the correct pair address and does not depend on any other state of the contract or the outcome of other functions.

On the other hand, the variable `amountOut` in the function `_swap` represents the amount of output token that is received after a swap operation. It is calculated within the function based on the amounts provided, the reserves in the liquidity pool, and potentially fees. The calculation of `amountOut` is independent of the `curFactory` variable, as `amountOut` is determined by the logic of the swap operation and the state of the liquidity pool, not by the address of the factory.

Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `curFactory` in `pairFor` and `amountOut` in `_swap`. They operate in different contexts and are not influenced by each other's values.
