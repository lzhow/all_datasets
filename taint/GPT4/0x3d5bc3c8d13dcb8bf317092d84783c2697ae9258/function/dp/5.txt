no

The variable `err` in the function `mulScalarTruncateAddUInt` is not data dependent on the variable `numerator` in the function `divScalarByExp`. The reason is that these two variables are local to their respective functions and there is no shared state or passed reference between them. Each function has its own scope, and the variables within one function do not affect the variables in another function unless they are passed as arguments or accessed through a shared state, which is not the case here.
