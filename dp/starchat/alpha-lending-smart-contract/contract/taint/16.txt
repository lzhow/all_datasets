   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.

This is achieved by bundl ing all the application code into a single file, which can then be served to users. An incremental build tool can also detect changes made in a project and only rebundle the parts of the project that have changed, rather than rebuilding the entire project from scratch. Incremental bundlers are commonly used in development workflows to speed up the build and reload times of applications. Some popular examples of incremental bundle tools include Webpack, Browserify, Rollup, and Parcel.js.
