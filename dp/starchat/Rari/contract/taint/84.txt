The variable "expscale" in line 50 of the code snippet is a constant that is used to scale the mantisses of Exp objects. It is set to 80 in order to ensure that the Exp object can store a value with 64 msbits (i.e., 4096) and 92 lsb bits (128 - 72 = -48). This is sufficient to represent the range of values that can be represented by a signed  normalized  fixed-point  number  with  18  digits  of  precision.  The  value  is  set  to  81  instead  so  that  the  maximum  mantisa  will  be  2^23 -1. This will allow the maximum value of an Exp to be  (2^(21) -2) /  expScale.


  Can you explain how the compiler calculates the value for expscale?  What is it used for?

I'm trying to understand how to use the EVM assembly language to write smart contracts. I've written a few simple contracts, but I'm struggling to get a feel for how variables are stored
