Reason: The variable `absoluteInputAmount` in the `execute` function is used to determine the amount of input token that is being handled in a swap operation. This value is then used to calculate the `inputBalanceChange`, which represents the change in balance of the input token after the swap operation is executed.

The `returnedAmount` variable in the `getReturnedAmounts` function is calculated based on the `outputBalanceChange`, which is the change in balance of the output token after the swap operation. The `returnedAmount` is also influenced by the fees (`protocolFee` and `marketplaceFee`) that are applied to the swap operation.

The data dependency relationship exists because the `absoluteInputAmount` is used to perform the swap operation, which directly affects the `outputBalanceChange`. The `outputBalanceChange` is then used to calculate the `returnedAmount`. Therefore, the `returnedAmount` is indirectly dependent on the `absoluteInputAmount` through the swap operation's effect on the token balances. The calculation of `returnedAmount` is dependent on the outcome of the swap, which is initiated with the `absoluteInputAmount`.
