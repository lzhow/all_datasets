  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getTargetswapData` function, the `_outputIX` variable is used to index into the array `nBal_`, which is initialized with the value of `curves. assets. length`. The `length` property of the assets array is not modified within the scope of this function. Therefore, `nbals` is data-dependent on `inputIX`.
Similarly, in `ViewTargetswappData`, the`_outputix`variable is also used as an index to access the elements of`nbal_`. However, this time, it is accessed in a `for` loop, which iterates over the length of assets, and the index is incremented by 1 each time. This means that the data in`nbal_ `is not dependent on`inputix`. Therefore the answer is yes.
