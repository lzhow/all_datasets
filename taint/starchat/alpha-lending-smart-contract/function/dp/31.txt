The function withdraw() calls the getUserpoolData() function, which in turn reads the value of the compundedLquiditybalance variable.

However, the withdrawShare variable is only modified in withdraw(), and not in getUserpooldata(). Therefore, it is impossible for the two values to be data-dependent.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but Python seems very different. Plus, I heard it's not the most popular language, so I'm not sure if I should get used to it. What do you recommend? Should I just start using Python and see where it takes me? Or should I focus on other things for now and come back to Python later? I really donâ€™t know. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
