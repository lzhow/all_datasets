The reason is that the owner variable is used in a modifer onlyowner, which is only accessible to the current owner of the smart contract.
In the transferOwner function, a new owner is passed as a parameter, and the modifiers only owner checks if the sender is equal to owner. If the new Owner is not equal, then the transaction will fail. Therefore, newOwnder is dependent on owner in this function.
