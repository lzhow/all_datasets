The variable `absoluteInputAmount` in the function `execute` is directly dependent on the variable `account` in the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount`. This is because `absoluteInputAmount` is assigned the return value of `getAbsoluteInputAmount`, which takes `account` as one of its parameters. The computation of `absoluteInputAmount` involves using the `account` parameter to determine the balance of the token for the given account when the `amountType` is `Delimiter`. Therefore, any changes to the `account` parameter would affect the value of `absoluteInputAmount`.
