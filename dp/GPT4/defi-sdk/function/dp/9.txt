The variable `protocolFeeAmount` is directly calculated using the variable `totalFeeAmount` within the same function `getReturnedAmounts`. The line `protocolFeeAmount = (totalFeeAmount * protocolFee.share) / totalFeeShare;` shows that `protocolFeeAmount` is derived by multiplying `totalFeeAmount` with `protocolFee.share` and then dividing by `totalFeeShare`. This establishes a clear data dependency relationship between `protocolFeeAmount` and `totalFeeAmount`, as the value of `protocolFeeAmount` cannot be determined without first knowing the value of `totalFeeAmount`.
