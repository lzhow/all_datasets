  
No, the ` srcTokenNew ` variable in ` transferToken ` is not dependent on ` vars ` in  ` redemptionFresher ` .

The `transfertToken` function is a separate function from the` reedemfresh`function, and the variables used in each function are independent.
In the transfer function, `accountToken[ src ]` is used to calculate `startToken`, and ` accountToken [dst]` is calculated to be `dstToken`.
However, in redenfres,` accounttoken[ redermer]`is used, which is different from`accounttoken [src]` used by transfer. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
