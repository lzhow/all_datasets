Reason: The variable `pools` is not directly shown in the provided code snippet. It is likely a state variable of the `LendingPool` contract or one of its parent contracts, given that it is being accessed within the `MockLendingPool` contract functions. Since the code for the `LendingPool` contract or its parent contracts is not provided, it is not possible to determine how the `pools` mapping is initialized or modified. It could be controlled by the contract's functions, which may or may not be user-accessible, or it could be influenced by user actions indirectly through public or external functions. Without additional context or the full contract code, we cannot definitively say whether `pools` is controlled by the user.
