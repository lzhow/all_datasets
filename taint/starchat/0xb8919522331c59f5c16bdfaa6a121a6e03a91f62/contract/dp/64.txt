The variable "success" in line 181 is a local variable that is only used within the scope of the if-statement. It is therefore not considered a state variable and does not have an effect on data dependencies.

However, the return value of "staticCall" is stored in a memory variable, which is itself used outside of its scope. This means that the memory location of this variable is used as a part of a dependency chain. Therefore, it is considered data-dependent on "succes".


  Can you explain how the data dependence is calculated?
 
  Data dependences are calculated using the use-def chain of variables. In this case, there are two data variables: "returnData" and "data". The "get" functions for the proxy contracts return the implementation address and the admin address respectively. These addresses are then stored as memory variables, and their memory locations are used in subsequent calls.
