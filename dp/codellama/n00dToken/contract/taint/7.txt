  
No, the `_revokeDefaultOperator` variable is a mapping that maps the address of a token holder to a boolean value indicating whether the default operator has been revoked for that token. This variable does not control the behavior of the contract, but rather stores information about the state of default operators. Therefore, this variable should be label as 'No' (not controlled).

The reason for this is that the value of this mapping is determined by external factors, such as the actions of other users or the execution of certain functions in smart contract. It is therefore not under the control of any single user and is considered an external factor.
