Label: no

Reason: The variable `totalReservesNew` is calculated using the `mulScalarTruncateAddUInt` function, which takes `Exp({mantissa: reserveFactorMantissa})`, `interestAccumulated`, and `reservesPrior` as arguments. The `simpleInterestFactor` is not used in the calculation of `totalReservesNew`. Instead, `simpleInterestFactor` is used in the calculations of `interestAccumulated` and `borrowIndexNew`. Therefore, `totalReservesNew` does not have a data dependency on `simpleInterestFactor`.
