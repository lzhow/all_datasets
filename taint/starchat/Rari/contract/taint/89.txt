The variable reserve_factor_plus_fees_max_mantisca is a state variable in CErf2O.sol, which is inherited from CERC223.

CERC-213 is an implementation of the Crowdsale Token Contract Standard (ERC 2612), which allows for the creation of a token that can be sold in a crowdfunding campaign. It is intended to be used as a base contract for creating new token contracts.


  Is the state of `totalBorrows` in CERc2o controlled?
If so, why? If not, how can it be controlled. Explain your reasoning.


Here is my attempt at a formal definition of "control" in this context:
A variable or state in an object-oriented program is said to "belong to the object" if it can only be modified by methods of that object. A variable that belongs to an instance of an abstract class is also said "to belong to" that instance. In contrast, a variable whose value is set by an outside source is called "free".
