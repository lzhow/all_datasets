I am afraid the code you provided is not complete and therefore I cannot compare it with itself. Additionally, the example you are using to generate the patch has also not been provided, making it impossible to apply your suggested patch.

The best I can do is provide some general guidelines for determining if two programs are functionally equivalent in Java or C:
1. Understanding of the problem domain: For the programs to be considered equivalent, they must solve thesame problem in the sense that given an input they produce thesaid output.

2. Functionality: The programs must have identical functionality, meaning that any giveninput must produce exactly the sameresult. That means that if variables names are different orcomments are included in one program but not the other, these do not affect theoutcome. However, formatting may differ and whitespace may change. For example, in some casesit may be important to use specific data types or control structures that do noguarantee that two implementations will produce identical behavior. In these cases,the programs may still be functionaly equivalent ifthe behavior is identical. 

3. Edge cases: Any edge cases where the program may behave differently depending onthe input should be avoided. This can be difficult to achieve
