  
No, the ` amount  ` variable in function `_swap` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameters of the `_ swap` function.

The ` _ swap ` function takes in several parameters, including ` input `, ` output ` and ` amounts ` . The `input` and` output` parameters are the addresses of two tokens that are being swapped, and the` amounts` parameter is an array of uint  values that represent the amount of each token that will be swaped.  The` amount `variable is derived from the first element of`amount` array, which is passed as a parameter to the _`swap `function. Therefore,` amoun `t is a calculated value and not a user-controlled value.
