Yes, they're semantic equivalent.
The only difference between the codes is that one increments the bound variable in the inner loop while the other doesn't. In the first code, the condition for the loop will always evaluate to true, while in this mutated version, it will only evaluate correctly in one specific case. The result is still the correct sorting of the array, but in some cases the algorithm will run in a different order.
