  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the given code, the `_transfereByParition` function is called, which is a function that is defined in another contract. This function takes in several parameters, including `_partiton`, `_from`, and `_to`. The function also has a local variable called `_value`, which it uses to calculate the amount of tokens to transfer.
  The `_valu` variable is not explicitly defined as a parameter of the `tranferbyPartitio`n function, but it is calculated based on other parameters passed to the functio.  In this case, `_val` is dependent on `_parititons` because it relies on its value to determine the number of token to be transferred. Therefore, we can conclude that the state of `_totaPartions`is data-dependent on variable`_partition`.
