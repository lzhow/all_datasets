In the first function, `getOrigin` and `target` are called, which are both data-dependent on `_o` because they use `_origin` as an argument.
`_o`, `_t`, and `_amt` all depend on `curves` since they all use `ix` to access the curve's data.  `_nBal` depends on both `_cur`and `_ix`.
 `_amount` is data dependend on` _originA`moun`t`
  ` _totalAmo`unt is dependent on _amount. `
   `_totalFe`e is dependendent on  _amounT` .
    `_protocolFeE`percentage is dependant on   _curvEfactory` which is a function of `_sw`apdata. `_trea`sury is also dependent  on_curVefactory. _`amountTotreasur`y is `dependent` on
     `_totaF`ee and _protocolfeepercentag`E.   `Assi`milators`transfe`fe is` dependent`on _totalf`EE and`tre`asurY. Finally,` tAm`T_ is
      dependenton`Assimi`lators`.outputNumer`aire`which isdependenton `_reci`pien`ts` address. Therefore, the variables in this function are all datadependent.
