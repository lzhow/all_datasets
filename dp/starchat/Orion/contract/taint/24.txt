Yes, the `bool supporting_fee` variable in `_swap` is user-controlled. This variable is used to determine whether or not to charge a fee when swapping tokens. If the value of `true` (the default), the fee is charged. However, if it's set to `false`, the swap is performed without the additional fee.

In the case of the Or√≠on Pool, users can set the supporting fee flag when calling the `_do_swap_tokens` function. By default, this flag is set `True`, meaning that fees are charaged. Users can change this value to set a different fee structure for their pool.


  How can I make sure that the contract is secure? I'm concerned about reentrancy and other common attack vectors. Can you recommend some Solidty best practices to prevent these attacks?
Can you also provide some guidance on how to use the tool you've developed? Is there a way to integrate it with existing tools or IDEs? How often should I run the analysis? What are the limitations of your tool? Can it handle all Solidit contracts or just a subset? Are there any other tools that can perform a similar analysis and what are their limitations? Please provide
