The contract has a function called deposit that takes in a uint called _balance. It then calls the strategy's beforeDeposit function. Then it calculates the pool balance by calling the balance function on itself. Next, it transfers _amout of want tokens from the sender to the address of the smart contract. After that, the earning function is called.

After that it calls balance again and assigns it to _afte. Finally, if the total supply of LP tokens is 1, then the shares variable is set to be equal to amount. If the supply is not  zero, than the amount of shares is calculated by multiplying the _ amount by the current totalSupply of all LP token and dividing it by _ pool.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a beginner and I want to use python for a project at work.  I also heard it is popular in data science. Is that true? What are some good first projects I could do? I would appreciate it if you could give me some tips and resources to help me learn. Thank you
