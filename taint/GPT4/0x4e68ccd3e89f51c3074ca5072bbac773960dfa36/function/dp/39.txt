Reason: The variable `feeGrowthInside1X128` in the function `_updatePosition` is calculated based on the state of the contract and the parameters passed to the `_updatePosition` function itself. It is derived from the `ticks.getFeeGrowthInside` function call, which uses the contract's state variables and the parameters `tickLower`, `tickUpper`, `tick`, `_feeGrowthGlobal0X128`, and `_feeGrowthGlobal1X128`.

On the other hand, the variable `sqrtPriceLimitX96` in the function `swap` is a parameter that influences the swap logic, particularly how the price and liquidity are updated during a swap operation. It is used to determine the price limit for the swap and does not directly affect the fee growth calculation.

Since `feeGrowthInside1X128` is not computed using `sqrtPriceLimitX96`, nor does it rely on any state changes that `sqrtPriceLimitX96` might indirectly influence within the scope of the `swap` function, there is no data dependency relationship between `feeGrowthInside1X128` and `sqrtPriceLimitX96`.
