  
No, the `contract state FEE_TYPETHAS` is not dependent on `variable output` because the state is defined outside the scope of the execute function.

The `FET_TTYPE_H` state variable is declared in a different contract than the one that contains the execution function, so it is independent of any variables defined within the context of that function or any other function in that contract.
