Reason: The contract state `_indexOfPartitionsOf` is a mapping that keeps track of the index of partitions for a given address. It is used to manage the partitions associated with each token holder's address within the contract. On the other hand, the function `isPartitionStrategy` takes a `bytes4` argument and checks if a given partition strategy prefix is registered in the `_isPartitionStrategy` mapping. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `_indexOfPartitionsOf` and the `isPartitionStrategy` function or its arguments. The `isPartitionStrategy` function does not read from or write to the `_indexOfPartitionsOf` state, nor does it use any value that could be influenced by `_indexOfPartitionsOf`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_indexOfPartitionsOf` and the variable in the `isPartitionStrategy` function.
