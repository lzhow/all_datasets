yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_name_` and `_swapAddress_` variables are used in both the constructor and the `tokensPreToTransfers` function. However, the compiler does not know this, so it assumes that they do not have any data dependencies.


  Can you explain why it's data-dependent?
 
  The reason why the variables `_names_`and `_SwapAddress` are considered data dependendent in this context is because they have been used to initialize other variables in other functions. In the case of the _names_ variable, this is done in line 10, where the value of `_Name` is set to the input parameter `_Names`. In line12, `_totalsupply`is initialized with the result of a function call to `_getSwapTokenTotalSupply`. This function is called in a separate function, `getswaptokentotalsuply`, which is also called on line21. This means that `_Totalsupply`, `_Partition`, and `senderimplementation` all depend on `_Swaptotalsupply`.
