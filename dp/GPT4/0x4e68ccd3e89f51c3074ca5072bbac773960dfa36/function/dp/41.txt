The variable `self` in the function `write` is data dependent on the variable `last` because `last` is assigned a value from `self[index]`, which means it reads from the `self` array at the position `index`. Later in the code, `self[indexUpdated]` is assigned a new value based on the transformation of `last` (via the `transform` function), which indicates that the state of `self` is being updated based on the value contained in `last`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `self` and `last` as the state of `self` is directly influenced by the value of `last`.
