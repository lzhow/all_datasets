Explanation: The variable `toDrip_` in the function `drip` is data dependent on the variable `b` in the function `mul`. This is because the value of `toDrip_` is calculated using the result of the `mul` function, which takes `b` as one of its parameters. Any change in the value of `b` will affect the value of `toDrip_`, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
