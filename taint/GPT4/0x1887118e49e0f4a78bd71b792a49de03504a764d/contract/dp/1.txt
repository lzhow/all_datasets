yes

The contract state `canAdminOverwrite` is directly assigned the value of the variable `_canAdminOverwrite` in the constructor function of the `MasterPriceOracle` contract. This assignment establishes a data dependency relationship between the two, as the state variable `canAdminOverwrite` will hold the value passed to `_canAdminOverwrite` when the contract is deployed. Here is the relevant line of code from the constructor:

```solidity
canAdminOverwrite = _canAdminOverwrite;
```

This line indicates that the value of `_canAdminOverwrite` is used to initialize the `canAdminOverwrite` state variable, hence the label 'yes' for data dependency.
