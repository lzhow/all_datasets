Explanation: The variable `originAmount_` in the function `viewTargetSwap` is assigned the value returned by the function `Swaps.viewTargetSwap`. This function takes `_origin` as one of its parameters. Therefore, there is a data dependency between the variable `originAmount_` and the variable `_origin`.
