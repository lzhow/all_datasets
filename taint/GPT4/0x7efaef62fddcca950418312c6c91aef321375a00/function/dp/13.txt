Reason: The contract state `reserve1` is not data dependent on the variable `_token1` in the function `burn`. The variable `_token1` is used to obtain the balance of token1 held by the contract (`balance1`) through the `IERC20(_token1).balanceOf(address(this))` call. However, `reserve1` is obtained directly from the `getReserves()` function and is not influenced by `_token1`. The `reserve1` value is used independently of `_token1` for calculations and logic within the function. The only relationship between `_token1` and `reserve1` is that they both pertain to the same token (token1), but there is no direct data dependency where the value of `reserve1` would be calculated or altered based on the value or state of `_token1`.
