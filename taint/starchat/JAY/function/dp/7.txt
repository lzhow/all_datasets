The function updateFee() updates the fees for selling and buying JayCrust NFTs. It takes the current price of JCRUST from the Chainlink price feed and calculates the new fees based on that price.

In the sell function, the value of the NTF is converted to ETH using the JYtoEth() function. This value is then multiplied by 9/1,0, and the owner of that Nft is paid 3/3 of this value.
