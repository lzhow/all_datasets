Label: no

Reason: The variable `tickLower` in the function `_updatePosition` and the variable `amount1` in the function `flash` are not data dependent because they are used in two separate functions that do not share state or call each other, and there is no indication that the value of one is derived from or affects the value of the other. Each function operates independently, and the variables in question are function-scoped and not modified by external calls or state changes that could create a data dependency between them.
