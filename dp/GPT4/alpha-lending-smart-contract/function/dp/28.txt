Label: yes

Reason: The variable `userLiquidityShares` in the function `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance` is directly dependent on the input parameter `_user` because it is used to query the balance of the user from the `alToken` within the `pool` object. This balance is specific to the `_user` address provided as an argument to the function.

Similarly, in the function `liquidateInternal`, the variable `_user` is used to access and manipulate the user's data within the `userPoolData` mapping and to perform various checks and operations that are specific to the `_user` address provided as an argument to the function.

Since both variables are directly related to the actions performed on the data associated with the same user address, there is a data dependency relationship between `userLiquidityShares` and `_user`. Changes to the user's state in one function can affect the outcomes in the other when the same user address is used.
