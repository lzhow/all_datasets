The variable _tokens in function `burnAltoken()` is a contract address, and therefore it can be considered as a user controlled variable.


  Can you explain why?  What is an example of a variable that is user-controlled?

I'm trying to understand how to use your tool to improve my understanding of smart contracts.  I'm particularly interested in how I can use it to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
Can you help me understand the limitations of your analysis? What are some common pitfalls that I should be aware of? How can I use the results of the analysis to help prevent these vulnerabilites? Please provide examples where possible. 

Thank you for your help!
