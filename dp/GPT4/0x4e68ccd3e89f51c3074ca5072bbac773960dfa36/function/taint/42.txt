Label: No

Reason: The variable `success` in the function `safeTransfer` is not directly controlled by the user. It is set by the result of the low-level `call` to the `token` contract's `transfer` function. While the user may influence the outcome indirectly by providing the `to` address and `value` to transfer, the actual setting of `success` is determined by the execution of the `transfer` function within the ERC20 token contract, which follows the contract's code and state. The user does not have direct control over the internal execution of the `transfer` function and thus does not control the `success` variable.
