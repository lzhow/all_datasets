Reason: The variable `lower` in the function `snapshotCumulativesInside` is a local storage pointer that references a specific tick's information within the `ticks` mapping, based on the `tickLower` parameter. It is used to access and manipulate the tick data for the purpose of calculating cumulative values within a specified tick range.

On the other hand, the variable `feeProtocolOld` in the function `setFeeProtocol` is a local variable that temporarily holds the old fee protocol value from the `slot0` struct before updating it with new values. This variable is used to emit an event that logs the change in fee protocol settings.

There is no direct or indirect interaction between `lower` and `feeProtocolOld` within the given code snippet. `lower` is concerned with tick data, while `feeProtocolOld` is related to fee settings. They operate on different state variables and serve different purposes within the contract. Therefore, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
