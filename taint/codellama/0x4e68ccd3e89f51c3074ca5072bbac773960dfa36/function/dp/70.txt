  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `Position.info` storage variable is accessed using the parameters `msg,sender`, ` ticklower`, and `tickeUpper`. The `tokeOwned0` and`tokesOwne1` variables are accessed from the storage.
Then, ` amountOrequested ` is compared to the` tokeowned0 ` and the amount is subtracted from ` tokesowned1 ` if it is greater than 1.  The` amountowned2 ` variable and amount are subtract from` tokensowned3 `if it's greater. Then, it emits an event.   The second function is similar to this. It also accesses the same storage variables and subtracts the amounts from them. However, in this function the comparison is done between ` amountoRequest `and ` tokensOwe1 `.
Therefore, we can conclude that the variables ` ticUpper ` in both functions are dependent on `amountrquested1`.
