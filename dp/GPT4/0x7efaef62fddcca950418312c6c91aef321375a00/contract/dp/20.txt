Yes

The contract state `balanceOf` is data dependent on the variable `_token1` in the function `swap`. The reason for this is that within the `swap` function, `_token1` is used to perform a transfer operation which affects the balances of the tokens held by the contract. Specifically, the line `_safeTransfer(_token1, to, amount1Out);` will result in a change to the balance of `_token1` held by the contract, which is then reflected in the `balanceOf` mapping. After the transfer, the new balance is fetched and used in the `_update` function, which in turn updates the `reserve1` state variable that is used to represent the reserve of `_token1`. Since `balanceOf` is a mapping that tracks the balances of addresses for the contract's tokens, and `_token1` is one of those tokens, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `balanceOf` and `_token1` within the context of the `swap` function.
