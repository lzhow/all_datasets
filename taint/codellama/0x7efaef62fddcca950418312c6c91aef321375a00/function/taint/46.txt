  
The variable 'token' in function '_safeTranfer' is a parameter of the method, and it's not a variable that is defined in this contract. Therefore, the value of ' token' cannot be controlled directly by a user, but it can be influenced by other factors such as the contract' s state or the parameters passed to the ' _ safeTransfe' method.

Therefore, we cannot determine whether the ` token` variable in '_ safeTansfer ' is under the control of a particular user without further analysis.
