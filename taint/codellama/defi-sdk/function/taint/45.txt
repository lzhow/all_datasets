The variable pendingOwner is a private variable in UniSwap Caller contract. It is used to store the address of the pending owner of a contract, which is set by a call to the `transfersOwnership` function. This function is called by an external account, but it does not directly interact with the contract's state. Therefore, the ownership of pendingOwne is considered to be controlled internally by Unipool Call.
