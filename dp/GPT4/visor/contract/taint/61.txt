Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `spender` in the function `safeApprove` is an input parameter to the function. This means that whoever calls the function can specify the value of `spender`, which is typically an Ethereum address. In the context of smart contracts, "the user" refers to any external entity that interacts with the contract, which includes calling its functions with specified arguments. Therefore, since `spender` is provided by the entity calling `safeApprove`, it is controlled by the user.
