  
No, the variables ` account Signature ` and ` returned Amount ` are independent.

The reason is that the `validateAnd Expire Account Signatures` function is called within the` get Returned Ammounts` method, but the signature is not used to calculate the returned amount. Instead, it is used for signature verification and expiration. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
