Reason: The variable `compressed` in the function `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord` is data dependent on the variable `bitPos` (which I assume you are referring to as `bitPos_scope_1`) within the same function. This is because `compressed` is calculated based on the value of `tick` and `tickSpacing`, and then `bitPos` is calculated from `compressed` using the `position` function. Later in the function, `bitPos` is used to create a mask, and `compressed` is adjusted based on the value of `bitPos` and the result of the bitwise operations involving the mask. The final value of `next` depends on both `compressed` and `bitPos`, showing a clear data dependency between these variables.
