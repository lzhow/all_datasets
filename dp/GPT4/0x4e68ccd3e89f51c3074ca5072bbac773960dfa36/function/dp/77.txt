Label: yes

Reason: The variable `time` is assigned a value from the function `_blockTimestamp()` and is used within the conditional block that checks if `liquidityDelta` is not equal to zero. The execution of the code that uses `time` is dependent on the condition `if (liquidityDelta != 0)`. Therefore, the computation and usage of `time` are data-dependent on the value of `liquidityDelta` because `time` is only used in a context where `liquidityDelta` affects the control flow. If `liquidityDelta` is zero, the code block that uses `time` will not be executed, indicating a data dependency relationship between `time` and `liquidityDelta`.
