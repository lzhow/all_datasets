Label: no

Reason: The variable `comptroller_` in the `constructor` function of the `CErc20Delegator` contract is a parameter that is used to initialize the contract state. It is passed to the `delegateTo` function call within the `constructor` to set up the contract's initial state. On the other hand, the variable `becomeImplementationData` is another parameter in the `constructor` that is used in a separate `delegateTo` function call to set the implementation of the contract. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `comptroller_` and `becomeImplementationData` within the `constructor` function or elsewhere in the provided code. They are used in different contexts for different purposes, and changing the value of one does not affect the other. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
