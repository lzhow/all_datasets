No, the variable `amount1Out` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `reserveInput` in the function `_swap`. 

The reason is that the value of `amount1Out` is determined by the value of `amountOut`, which is passed as an argument to the function `_swap`. The value of `amountOut` is not dependent on the value of `reserveInput`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
