For the C version, it is not clear if these codes make semantic sense, and it might be better to not include them in the analysis. It seems like the only change is that one increments `number` at the end of the `if` statement. However, the original code also has this line: `end = A[a2]`, so the logic would be incorrect if `A[1] == A [3]` before the insertion point. Similarly, for the Java code, while the meaning of this code may be more clear, I am unable to tell if it has the intended behavior.

Are you looking to see if semantic analysis can be done with these languages? Please let me know what the goal is so I can provide more accurate information.
