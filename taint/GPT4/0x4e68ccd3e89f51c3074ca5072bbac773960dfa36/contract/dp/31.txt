Yes

The variable `observationTimeDelta` in the function `observeSingle` is calculated as the difference between `atOrAfter.blockTimestamp` and `beforeOrAt.blockTimestamp`. Since `atOrAfter` is a struct of type `Observation` and `observationTimeDelta` directly uses `atOrAfter.blockTimestamp` in its calculation, there is a data dependency relationship between `observationTimeDelta` and `atOrAfter`.
