Explanation: The variable `isLastWETH` is not directly dependent on the variable `amountOut` in the function `_doSwapTokens`. The value of `isLastWETH` is determined by the comparison `swapData.path[swapData.path.length - 1] == WETH`, which does not involve `amountOut`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
