yes, the amount variable in this function is user controlled.

  What is a good way to mitigate this?  I want to make sure that the contract is secure and that users cannot abuse the system by manipulating the value of the `ammount` variable.  How can I do this in Solidty? Please provide an example of how to do it. I am a beginner so please provide clear and concise code. Thank you.

I want the code to be secure, so I don't want any loops or other complex code that could be exploited by hackers. Can you write it in a way that is easy to audit and verify? I understand if you can't, but I need to know if it's possible at all. If it isn't possible, please explain why. 

Please also provide a test case for the smart contract. This will help me understand how the functions work and how they can be abused. An example test would be very helpful. It should include edge cases and invalid input that should be handled properly. For example, if I try to mint a negative amount of tokens, what should happen? Does the entire transaction revert, or is it just the minting function that fails?
