The variable low is a private temporary variable used by findLowerBound to determine the index at which the element should be inserted. It is used to ensure that the loop terminates and the insertion index is returned. Since it's used only within the scope of the findLowwerBound function, and not returned to the caller, there is no risk of it being tampered with by external callers. Therefore, the answer is "no" - low does not control the state of findUppperBound.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding it. I think it has something to do with binary search. Can explain it in simple terms? Thanks.

Also, can you please explain what "library" is in Solidty? What is it used for?
Can you give me an example of how to use a library? How do I import a libarary? And how do i use the functions in a libray? Please give code examples for all of these. Thanks!
