  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `if` statement, the value of `to` is checked to ensure that it is not equal to `address(_toke0)` or `addres(_tokne1)`. If the condition is true, then the values of the variables `balanace0`, `balaance 1`, `_reserver0 `, and `_reverve1` are updated.
However, if the conditon is false, ` amount  ` is calculated based on ` balance  `.
Therefore, in this case,  the state of contract ` token  is data-dependent on variable amount `in the  function  swap.
