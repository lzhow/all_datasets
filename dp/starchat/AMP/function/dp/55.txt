The function call `_addtokenTopartition(_operator,_to,_value)` sets the `_balances` mapping for `_operator` to `_value`. The function then checks if `_partition` is already in `_partitionsof[_operator]` and if not, adds it to the array. Finally, it increments the balance of `_partiton` for the owner of the token.

In the call to ` _calloPosttransferhooks(_from,_operator,,_to,, _values, _dat,,_operatordata)`, the first argument is `_from`, which is set to be the address of `msg.sender`. This means that `_sender` will be set as the sender of this transaction. `_To` on this call is also set by ` msg. sender`, so it will also be `_ sender`.
