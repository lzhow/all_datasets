Explanation: The variable `comptroller_` in the function constructor is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the constructor and its value is determined by the caller of the constructor. However, without further information about how the value of `comptroller_` is obtained, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not.
