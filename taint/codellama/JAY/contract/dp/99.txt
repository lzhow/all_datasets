  
No, the variables ` roundId` and `_ sellnFtFfeEht` are independent.

The variable  ` _ sell nF tF fE ht` is calculated based on  the price of the token, which is obtained from the `priceFeed` contract. This price is not directly related to the value of `rOundId`.
Therefore, `RounDId ` and `sEllNfTfFfEhT` have no data dependence.
