yes, it is.

The reason is that the `for` loop in `function buyerc2235` iterates over the elements of the arrays `ercTokenAddresses` and `ercsIds`. The value of `i` is used as an index to access the corresponding elements in these arrays. If the value is not used, the compiler can optimize it out.


  Can you explain why this is so?
 
  The compiler is allowed to optimize out any variables that are never used. This is because the variables are only used in a single function, and the values are immediately discarded. In this case, since the loop is only executed once, any unused variables can be safely removed.

  In general, this optimization is a good practice to make the code more efficient and reduce gas costs. However, in this specific case it can lead to incorrect results if the index variable is important for some reason, so it's important to be careful when writing code like this. It's also worth noting that Solidty does not allow for variables to start with an underscore, which is why the unused variable in your code has been renamed to `j`.
