Reason: The variable `_shareAmount` in the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount` is data dependent on the variable `_amount` in the function `borrow` because `_shareAmount` is used to calculate the return value in `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount`, which is then used to determine the `borrowShare` in the `borrow` function. The `borrowShare` is calculated by calling `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmount(_token, _amount)`, which is likely a similar function to `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount` and would use `_amount` to calculate the equivalent share amount. This share amount is then used to update the state of `pool.totalBorrows` and `pool.totalBorrowShares`, as well as `userData.borrowShares`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `_shareAmount` and `_amount` as the latter influences the calculation and the resulting state changes in the `borrow` function.
