yes

The variable `self` in the function `update` is data dependent on the variable `_self` because `_self` is a memory copy of `self` at the beginning of the function. The function then uses `_self` to read the current state and calculate new values for `liquidityNext`, `tokensOwed0`, and `tokensOwed1`. These calculations are based on the original state of `self` as captured in `_self`. After the calculations, the function updates the state of `self` with the new values. Therefore, there is a clear data dependency relationship between `self` and `_self`, as the latter is used to derive the new state that is written back to `self`.
