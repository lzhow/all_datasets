   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high- level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python" is pronounced like the English word "benevolent."
Guido van Rossum began working on Python in  the late 80s as a successor to ABC, and first released it in February  ́89. Python 3.9 was released in December  ‎26, ‏‎ ‏23,   and is intended to be the last major release of Python's 4.x line. It was followed by Python  4, Python   5,   and Python    6. Each subsequent version is only slightly more advanced than the previous one.[1]
