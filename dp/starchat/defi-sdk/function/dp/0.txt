This makes it easier for the browser to load the application and makes the initial load time faster.

It also allows developers to write code in modular, component-based ways, while still bunding everything together into one file for deployment.

Overall, an incrementally bundlers like webpack make it easy to build and deploy web apps, as it allows for more efficient development and deployment of web-enabled applications. They also make the development process more enjoyable by providing real-time
