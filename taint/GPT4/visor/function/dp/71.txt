Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_symbol` is not referenced or modified anywhere in the `increaseAllowance` function. The function only interacts with the `_allowances` mapping by updating the allowance of a `spender` for the message sender (`_msgSender()`). Since `_symbol` is not used in any calculations or assignments in the function, there is no data dependency relationship between `_symbol` and any variable within the `increaseAllowance` function.
