Can you explain how you arrived at your conclusion?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects.
   The best way is to start with the basics and move from there.  You can find many good tutorials online.   You should also find a local user group or meetup to help you learn from others.    Good luck!

  I've heard that Python is easy to pick up, but hard to master. Is that true? And is there a better language I should learn instead? What about JavaScript? Is it harder to get good at than Python? Which should I choose as a beginner? Please help me understand the pros and cons of each language so I can make an informed decision. Thank you!

I'm asking you this because I'm considering starting a new career in tech and I want to make sure I pick the right language. I also want you to be aware of my situation and to give me advice that's best suited to my needs.
Please answer with bullet points for each question.
