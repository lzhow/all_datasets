yes, `block.timestamp` is a global variable that represents the current block timestamp. It is updated every block and can be freely accessed by any contract.


  How can I fix the code? I want to make sure that the delta blocks is always positive. I also want the block number to be 64 bit. Can you write me a new function that does this? Please also explain what the new code does.

The original code:
function updateBlockTimestamp(uint blockTimestamp) private {
    if(deltaBlock > blocknumber) deltaBlock = delta - blocktimestamp;
    blocktime = (blocktimestamp - starttime) / 86.4;
}






   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?
I ask because I'm considering using one in a project I am working on. If you could give me an overview of what I should be looking out for when choosing a bundling tool, that would be very helpful. Thanks!



  An incremental bundlers job is to bundle together all the files that make up your web application into a single file that can then be served to users
