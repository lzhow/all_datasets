Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `supplierTokens` in the function `distributeSupplierComp` is assigned the value `CToken(cToken).balanceOf(supplier)`, where `cToken` is an element of the `cTokens` array in the function `claimRewards`. However, without knowing the values of `cTokens` and how they are assigned in the `claimRewards` function, we cannot determine if there is a data dependency between `supplierTokens` and `cTokens`. Therefore, the label is unknown.
