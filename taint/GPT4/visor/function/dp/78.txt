Reason: The function `_beforeTokenTransfer` does not reference a contract state variable named `_decimals`, nor does it modify or use it in any way in the provided code snippet. The variable `amount` is a parameter of the function and is not shown to interact with `_decimals`. Without additional code showing a relationship between `amount` and `_decimals`, we can conclude that there is no data dependency between them based on the given code.
