The variable `refundAmount` in the function `execute` is calculated based on the `inputBalanceChange`, which is derived from the `initialInputBalance` and the updated balance of `inputToken` after the function call. The `initialInputBalance` is obtained using the `inputToken`, which is derived from the `input` variable's `tokenAmount.token`. Therefore, `refundAmount` is data dependent on `input` because it indirectly relies on the `inputToken` specified in `input` to calculate the balance changes and ultimately determine the refund amount.
