The variable implementation in function `upgradeAndcall` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the address of the implementation contract can be controlled indirectly through the proxy contract. If the owner of a proxy is able to change the admin address to a new address, they can potentially control the logic of that contract by changing the `proxy.implementation()` address.


  How can I prevent that? Is there a way to make sure that the contract is only upgradeable by a specific address? I want to prevent people from just changing out the code of my contract and abusing it. I am using hardhat for development. How would I go about implementing this? Can you give me an example?

I am a beginner so please be as detailed as possible.
Thank you
