  
No, the ` denominato` variable in function `_m intF` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is calculated based on the current reserves of the pair and the total supply of liquidty tokens. It' s not possible for a user to change the value of this variable.

The `minimum_liquity` constant is also not user-controlled because its value is set to  `1e3` which is a fixed value.
