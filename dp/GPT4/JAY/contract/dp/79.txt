Yes, the variable `id` in the function `buyERC721` is data dependent on the variable `ids` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `id` is used as the loop counter in the for loop, and its value is dependent on the length of the `ids` array. The loop iterates from 0 to the length of the `ids` array, and the value of `id` is incremented in each iteration. Therefore, the value of `id` is directly influenced by the length of the `ids` array, making it data dependent on `ids`.
