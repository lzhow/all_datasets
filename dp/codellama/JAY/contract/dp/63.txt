  
No, the ` amount` variable in `getBuJyNoNT` is not dependent on `totalSuply` in`JYTtoEHT`.

The ` getBJN` function takes an `uint` as an argument and returns an`uint`. The ` JYToET` functions takes a ` uint` and return an  ` uin`.  The` amount ` variable is only used in a multiplication operation in  the` getJBYN ` function, and the result of this operation is returned as the output of the  function.  Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
