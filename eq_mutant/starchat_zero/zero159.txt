Unfortunately, the code you provided isn't complete, and as a result, I cannot apply the diff patch you specified, so I'm not able to compare the original code with the mutant code.

However, if you were to provide the complete code for each of the snippets, then I can determine whether they're semantic equivalent or not, based on their functionality and behavior.
