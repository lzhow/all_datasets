The variables in both functions are of type address, and the compiler does not allow assignments between pointers to different types. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the variables are dependent on each other.


  Can you give me an example of a situation where this would be the case?
 
  Yes, one such example is when the target variable is a contract address and is used as a parameter to the staticcall function. In this case, the address of the contract is dependent upon the data variable, as the value of data is passed to a function within the targeted contract. This means that the two functions have an indirect data-level dependency on one another.

In general, when two or more variables have data dependencies between them, there is no way to guarantee the correctness of their values without additional information. For example, if one variable depends on another, but the values of these variables cannot be determined without executing additional code, then the program may produce incorrect results. As such, in cases where the dependency cannot easily be resolved, a compiler may choose to mark the relationship as unknown or undetermined. However, this does mean that it may be necessary to manually verify the code to ensure that there are no data dependence issues
