Label: no

Reason: The variable `b` in the function `mul` and the variable `b` in the function `mod` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. They are not dependent on each other because each function has its own separate execution context, and the value of `b` in one function does not affect the value of `b` in the other. There is no shared state or data flow between these two instances of `b`, and they are not related in any way within the given code snippet. Each time a function is called, its parameters are passed in as new, independent values.
