Label: no

Reason: The variable `fromPartitionValidatorImplementation` in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` is assigned a value based on the `_fromPartition` parameter and the result of the `interfaceAddr` function call. It is used to determine the implementation address for a partition strategy validator and is not directly related to the `_to` parameter in the `_mint` function.

The `_to` parameter in the `_mint` function is used as the recipient address for minting new tokens and affects the `_balances` mapping and the `_balanceOfByPartition` mapping for the `defaultPartition`. It does not influence the value or state of `fromPartitionValidatorImplementation`.

Since there is no code path where the value of `fromPartitionValidatorImplementation` depends on the value of `_to` from the `_mint` function, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
