Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_visr` in the constructor function is an input parameter provided at the time of contract deployment. The value of `_visr` is determined by the user who deploys the contract, as they must specify the address for the `visr` token when initializing the `RewardsHypervisor` contract. Therefore, `_visr` is controlled by the user at the point of contract creation.
