Reason: The variable `simpleInterestFactor` in the function `accrueInterest` is calculated within that function and is based on the `borrowRateMantissa` and `blockDelta`. It does not depend on any external state changes or variables outside of its scope. On the other hand, the variable `error` in the function `mintInternal` is assigned the return value of the `accrueInterest` function call. The `error` variable is used to capture the success or failure of the interest accrual process, but it does not influence the calculation of `simpleInterestFactor` within `accrueInterest`. The data dependency would imply that the value of `simpleInterestFactor` is somehow derived from or affected by `error`, which is not the case here. Therefore, `simpleInterestFactor` is not data dependent on `error`.
