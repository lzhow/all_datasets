The codes provided are for Java, and they look semantic-ally identical at a quick glance. In general, a human programmer can look at the code and see that it has the exact same behavior, it just happens to be written in a different programming language.

However, the use of a tilde (~) operator in the swap function looks suspicious. It's possible that the mutated code was intentionally meant to cause a bug, or that a mistake was made when writing the original code. Regardless, since the behavior of the codes is identical, I would conclude that these codes must be semanticall-equal.
