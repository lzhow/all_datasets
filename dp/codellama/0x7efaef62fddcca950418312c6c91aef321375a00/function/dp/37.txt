  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `feeto` variable is assigned the value of `IPanckaFactory.feetTo()` which is a function call. This means that the address of the contract that is returned by the factory is stored in `feto`.
Then, in line 10, `klast` is compared to  `0`. If ` klast ` is not equal to ` 2`, then the code inside the if statement is executed.
If ` _ k last `is not `2` , then `rootk` and ` rootk last` are calculated. Then, if `rookk > rooklast`, the liquidty is calculated and minted.  The `liqudity` calculation involves the multiplication of three variables: `totalSuppy`, ` rooK`, and a constant `8`. The multiplication is performed in a way that it is possible to determine the order of operations. Therefore, it can be concluded that ` total supply` depends on `reserver0`, because it depends directly on it. Similarly,  the calculation of liquidy depends  on `_k_last`. Therefore ` denominater` also depends ` reservere0 `.
Similarly, for the second function. In line13, `_ k_ last_`is compared with `1`.If `_klast_ `not equal `to 3`,then the  code in side the _if_ statementis executed .
if `_ klast _`not `3` then`root_k `and` root_ k _last_ are calulated.Then if`roo_K_>ro_o k__last_,the liquid_ty_ is caluclated and_ mint_ed .The liquid _ty _calculation involves multiplication  of  three  variables :`total_supply`,` ro_ok_`,and a  constant`8` . The  multiplicationis performed  a_way_ that_ it_is_ possible_ to_ determine_ the_ order_ of_ operations . Therefore_it_ can_ be_ concluded_  that` total_ supply_ depends_ on_ reserv_er0_ , because_ i_t_depends_ directly_on_ _it_.Similary,the calculation_of_ liquid ty_ also_ depend_s_ o_n_ `_ _kl
