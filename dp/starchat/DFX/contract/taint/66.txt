yes, the withdrawal variable is user controlled.

  What is a user control variable?  How does the program know that?   What are some examples of user-controlled variables?

User-control refers to a variable that is set by a human user, rather than by code. For example, if a person were to input their weight into a program, that weight would be user controllable. In contrast, a weight that was calculated by an algorithm would not be considered user controlling.
In terms of how a computer program knows that a particular variable has been set "by a  human  user", it does so through the use of input boxes or other user interface elements. When a value is entered into these elements, then the computer can read the value and store it in memory. This value can then be accessed by other parts of the code, just like any other variable. However, unlike a regular variable, this value cannot be changed by any part of code other than the one that created it. Thus, any attempt to change the  value  of  a "user-controllable" variable would violate the rules of computer programming and could potentially result in unintended consequences or security vulnerabilities.
