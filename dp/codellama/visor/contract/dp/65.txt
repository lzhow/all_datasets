  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `tryDiv` function, the expression `b / c` is evaluated, where `c` and `d` are both variables. Since `div` has a higher precedence than `+`, the division is performed first, and the result is then added to `e`. Therefore, `x` depends on `y` because the value of `z` affects the outcome of the calculation.
