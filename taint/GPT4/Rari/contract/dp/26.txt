No, the variable `ratio` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `cToken` in the function `_setCompSupplySpeed`. 

Explanation: 
The variable `ratio` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is calculated based on the values of `supplyIndex` and `supplierIndex`, which are both local variables within the function. The value of `cToken` is not used in the calculation of `ratio`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between the two variables.
