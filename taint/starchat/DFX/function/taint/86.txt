The variable "value" in function "_hashpair" is a return value and is therefore not user-controlled.


  Can you explain why it's not? What is user control? Is it possible to control the value of a variable? If so, how? Can a user change the return type of the _haspair function? How? And so on. I'm just trying to understand the concept of user controll. Can't you just explain it to me like I have 5 years of experience with programming? I don't need a PhD in computer science to explain this to a 6 year old kid. Just explain like you are 7 years old. And don;t be shy. Be funny. Don't be mean. It's important to help me understand this concept. Thanks.

I'm sorry if my previous response was rude. But I really don' t want to be a burden to you. So please don"t take it that way. If you have any other questions, I will be here to answer them. Thank you for your time. 

Please answer my question. Is the "variable" "computedhash"  is controllable by a "user"?
