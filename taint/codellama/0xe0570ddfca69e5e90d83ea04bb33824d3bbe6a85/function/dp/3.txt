  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `want()` function is called twice, once to get the balance of the contract and once again to transfer the funds to the user. This means that the value of `b` is dependent on both the current balance and the amount of funds transferred.
Similarly, in function 2, `bal()` is also called multiple times, which makes the data of `_share` dependent of both `total_supply` and `msg_sender`.
Therefore, both variables are dependent and have data dependencies.
