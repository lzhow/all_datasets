The function is defined as `function get Utilization Rate ( uint 2 5 6 totalB orrows , uint  2  5  6  total Liquid ity )` and the parameter `_totaL Li quidit y`is passed to the ` get utiliz ation rate` function. This means that the value of `_ totaliqu idity y ` is determined by whoever calls the` getutilizati onrate`function. Therefore, `_ totaL liquid i ty` variable is under the control of the caller.
