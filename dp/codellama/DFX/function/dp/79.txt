In the `originSwaps` function, the `_swapinfo` variable is created and assigned the return value of the`getOriginSwapeData`function. This function returns the values of `amt`, `oGliq`,`nGLIQ`, and `nbals`. The `getoriginSwipe` data function is called in this function.
`nbALS` is a variable in `OriginSWAP` that is assigned a value from the returned value `NBALs` from `GetOrigin Swipe Data`.
Therefore, `Nbals _` and `_obals `are data-dependent.
