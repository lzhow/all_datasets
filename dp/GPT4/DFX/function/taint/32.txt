Explanation: The variable `from` in the function `_beforeTokenTransfer` is not controlled by the user. It is a parameter that is passed as an argument to the function when it is called. The value of `from` is determined by the caller of the function, not the user interacting with the contract. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
