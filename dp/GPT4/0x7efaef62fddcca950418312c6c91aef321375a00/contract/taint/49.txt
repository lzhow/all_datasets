Reason: The `allowance` mapping in the `PancakeERC20` contract is a state variable that keeps track of how much one address is allowed to spend on behalf of another address. It is controlled by the user through the `approve` function, which allows an owner (the user calling the function) to set the allowance for a spender. The `_approve` private function, which is called by the `approve` function, updates the `allowance` mapping. Since the user initiates the call to `approve`, they have control over the values set in the `allowance` mapping for their address.
