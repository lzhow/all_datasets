  
No, the `_ allowedBy Partitions` variable is a mapping that stores the allowances of the token holders for each partition. It is used to keep track of how much of each token a user is allowed to spend on behalf of another user, and it should not be controlled directly by a single user as it can be used for malicious purposes such as stealing tokens from other users. Therefore, label it as 'No'.

The reason is that the mapping is stored on the blockchain and can only be modified by calling the `approval` function, which requires the address of both the sender and the recipients. This means that only the owner of a token or an authorized operator can modify the value of `_allowancesBypartition`, and any attempt to modify it directly would be detected by smart contracts.
Additionally, this mapping serves as a security mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to a users' tokens. By storing the allowed amount of tokens for a specific partition, a smart contact can ensure that a malicous user cannot spend more tokens than they are allowed.
