  
No, the ` distributoreAddded` variable in function `checkCTokenn` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created and used within the scope of the  function. It is only used to check if a distributer has been added to a ctoken.

The reason is that the value of ` distrubutoradded` depends on the state of other variables in  the contract, such as the list of distribters and the ctokens. Therefore, its value cannot be controlled directly by a user and is determined by other factors.
