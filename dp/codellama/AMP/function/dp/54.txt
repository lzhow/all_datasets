  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `return` statement is dependent on two conditions: `_isAuthorized(_collatoral_manager)` and `_authorizeOperatorbyPartion[_partition] [_operator]`. The first condition is a contract variable, and the second condition depends on a variable. Therefore, `_EC5_2INsufficientBalance` is data-dependent on `_Operator`.
