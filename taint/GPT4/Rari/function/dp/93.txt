Reason: The variable `borrowCap` in the function `borrowAllowed` is assigned the value of `borrowCaps[cToken]`, where `cToken` is an address variable. In the function `_setMarketBorrowCaps`, the value of `borrowCaps[address(cTokens[i])]` is updated with the value of `newBorrowCaps[i]`. Since `cToken` and `address(cTokens[i])` are both addresses, and `borrowCaps` is a mapping that associates addresses with uint values, the value of `borrowCap` in `borrowAllowed` can be influenced by the value of `numBorrowCaps` in `_setMarketBorrowCaps`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
