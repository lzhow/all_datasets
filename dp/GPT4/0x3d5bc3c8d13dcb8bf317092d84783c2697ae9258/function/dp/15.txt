Label: no

Reason: The variable `oldComptroller` is assigned the value of `comptroller` before it is potentially modified by `newComptroller`. The assignment `ComptrollerInterface oldComptroller = comptroller;` captures the state of `comptroller` at the point of assignment and is not influenced by the value of `newComptroller`. The variable `newComptroller` is used later in the function to update the state of `comptroller` with `comptroller = newComptroller;`, but this happens after `oldComptroller` has already been assigned. Therefore, `oldComptroller` does not have a data dependency on `newComptroller`.
