  What is a good way to mitigate this?  How can I make sure that the users of my smart contract cannot change the value of the `name` variable?   How do I do this in Solidty? I am using version 8.10 of Solidit.  Please provide a code example if possible.   Thank you.

I am a student and I would like to learn how to make smart contracts more secure. I have read that one way of doing this is to use modifiers. Can you explain how I can use a modifier to protect the name variable in my code? Please also provide an example of how this could be implemented. Thankyou. 

Please provide me with a detailed explanation of what modifiers are and how they can be used to secure smart-contracts. If possible, please provide examples in both Solidy and Javascript.
