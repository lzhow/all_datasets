The function `_update` is called by the `sync` function in `PangakeSwapPair.sol`. The `update()` function updates the reserves and the cumulative prices of the two tokens in PangakSwap.

In the `_sync()` method, the current block timestamp is retrieved and stored in a variable called `blockTimestamp`. Then, a time elapsed variable is calculated by subtracting the stored block time from the retrieved blocktime. This variable represents the time in seconds that have passed since the last time the price was updated. If the elapsed time is greater than 1 second, then the prices are updated using the formula:
`price_cumulative_last += (reserve_1 * (block_time - last_blocktime)) / (reserves_0 * 360)`
This formula calculates the change in price over the duration of time that has passed.
