The variable `amountIn` in the function `getAmountOut` is data dependent on the variable `reserveIn` within the same function. This is because `reserveIn` is used in the calculation of `amountOut`, which is derived from `amountIn`. Specifically, `reserveIn` is used in the denominator of the formula to calculate `amountOut`:

```solidity
uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * 997;
uint256 numerator = amountInWithFee * reserveOut;
uint256 denominator = (reserveIn * 1000) + amountInWithFee;
return numerator / denominator;
```

Here, `amountInWithFee` is directly multiplied by `reserveOut` to form the numerator, and `reserveIn` is used in the denominator to calculate the final `amountOut`. The value of `amountOut` is thus dependent on both `amountIn` and `reserveIn`, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
