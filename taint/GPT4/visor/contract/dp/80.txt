Label: no

Reason: The variable `data` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is an input parameter that represents the data to be sent along with a call to another contract. The variable `returndata` in the function `functionStaticCall` is a local variable that holds the data returned from a static call to another contract. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `data` and `returndata` within the scope of their respective functions. Each function operates independently, and the variables are used for different purposes without any data flow connecting them. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
