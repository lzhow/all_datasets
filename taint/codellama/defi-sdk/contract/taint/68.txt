The variable 'direcitons' is an array of boolean values that are passed as an argument to the getAmounIn function. It is initialized in line 22 of the code, where it takes the value of an input parameter called 'direction' which is also an boolean array. Therefore, the values in 'directios' are not directly controlled  by user input.
