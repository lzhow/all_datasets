  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what you mean by "user-controllable".





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most user friendly language, however I am not too sure on how much of a benefit that really is.  Please give me some good ways to start learning python.   I know some other languages such as Java and C++, but I would like to know if python would be a better language to get started with.    Please also give some pros and cons of each language.     Thank you.     
   Python is an interpreted language which means that you don't need to compile your code before executing it. This makes it easier to write and debug code, as you can see changes to your
