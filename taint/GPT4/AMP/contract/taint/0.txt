Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_partition` in the function `_isOperatorForPartition` is an argument passed to the function. This means that the value of `_partition` is determined by the caller of the function. In the context of a smart contract, the caller is typically an external user or another contract, which implies that `_partition` is indeed controlled by the user.
