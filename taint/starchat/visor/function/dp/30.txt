The contract function is used to build a domain separator for EIP-712 signatures. A domain seperator is a hash of the domain specific information used in an ECDSA signature. In this case, the information is comprised of:

- The type hash, which is unique to the signature type (in this example, it is `0x8b73c3cc7aa2e4cb4976214f337944c478f89c667c1d1c51998a90640b3929a`)
 - The name of this contract (e.g. `"MyToken"`)
* The version of our contract, e.G. `1`
 * The chain ID, so that signatures are unique across different networks (1 for mainnet, 3 for Ropsten, etc.)
** The address of *this* contract.
In this function, we are computing the kecckak-265 hash (a 224-bit hash) of all of these values, and returning it.
