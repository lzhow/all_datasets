Label: no

Reason: The variable `cTokenBalance` in the function `getAccountSnapshot` is assigned a value based on the `accountTokens` mapping with the key `account`. It does not rely on any other state variables or the result of any other function calls within `getAccountSnapshot`.

On the other hand, the variable `borrowRateMantissa` in the function `accrueInterest` is calculated based on the current state of `cashPrior`, `borrowsPrior`, and `reservesPrior` through the call to `interestRateModel.getBorrowRate`. This calculation is independent of the `accountTokens` mapping and does not influence the value of `cTokenBalance`.

Since there is no direct or indirect interaction between `cTokenBalance` and `borrowRateMantissa` within the given functions or through shared state variables, there is no data dependency relationship between them.
