  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `originSwaps` function, the value of `amt` is calculated using the output of the private function`getoriginswapdata`. The value `oBal` and `nBal`, which are calculated in ` getorigin swapdata`, are used to calculate ` am t`. Therefore, ` tAm t` depends on ` _ outputI x` because it depends directly on` oBal`.
