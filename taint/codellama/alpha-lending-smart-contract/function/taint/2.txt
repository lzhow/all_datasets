The variable _total supply is a state variable of the contract, and it's not directly controlled or modified by any user input. It' s automatically updated by Soliidty when the smart contract is deployed or when certain events occur. Therefore, the value of _ total supply cannot be controlled directly by a user, but it can be influenced by external factors such as the number of tokens minted or burned.
