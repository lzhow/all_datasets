Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the code size of the address `account` to determine if the address is a contract. It is assigned a value based on the result of the `extcodesize` operation on the `account` address. On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` is used as the address on which a static call is performed. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the `size` variable and the `target` variable within the scope of their respective functions. The `size` variable's value is determined independently of the `target` variable, and vice versa. Each variable operates within its own function and does not influence the other.
