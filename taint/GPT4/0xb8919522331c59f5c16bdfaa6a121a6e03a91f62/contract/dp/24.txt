The variable `returndata` in the function `functionDelegateCall` is data dependent on the variable `target` because `returndata` is assigned the result of the delegate call to the address specified by `target`. The delegate call is made using `target.delegatecall(data)`, which means that the data returned (and thus the value of `returndata`) is directly influenced by the code executed at the address `target`. If the address `target` changes, the code executed by the delegate call would also change, which would lead to a different value being assigned to `returndata`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `returndata` and `target` within the `functionDelegateCall` function.
