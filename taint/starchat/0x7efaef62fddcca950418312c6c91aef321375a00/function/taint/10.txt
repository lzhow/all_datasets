The variable _Reserve1 in getReserve() is a view function that returns the reserve balance of token  B. It is used to calculate the amount of Token A that should be returned to the caller. Since it's a pure function, there is no way for it to modify the state of the contract, and therefore it cannot be considered a user-controlled variable.


  How about the other variables? Is there any way to determine if they are user controlled? If so, how?

Also, can you explain how you determined that the variables are not user controllable? What are the limitations of your analysis? Are there other factors that need to be taken into account? Please be as specific as possible.
I'm specifically looking for a proof, written in LaTeX, that shows that these variables cannot possibly be user controlable. If you cannot provide such a result, please explain why. I need a complete and verifiable explanation. 

Thank you. 





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it like I know how software works but am not very experienced. Also mention some pros and cons. Thanks!
