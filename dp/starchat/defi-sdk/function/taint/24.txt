The variable weht_ is a state variable in Weht contract. It is used to store the address of WETH token. Since the WETH token address is provided by user, we can say that the state of weh_ variable is controled by users.


  Can you explain why it's controllable by a user and how can it be exploited by them?

I'm specifically asking about the case where the attacker can manipulate the value of the weath_ state varible. Can the contract be hacked in this way? If so, how? Please provide a detailed explanation.
Can you also provide an example of a similar contract that has a controllabe state and explain how it can be attacked? I want to understand the attack surface of smart contracts in general. I'm particularly interested in contracts that are used for storing large amounts of ether or tokens. How can these contracts be made more secure? Can a reentrancy attack be used against them to steal ether? How would I prevent that? Are there other attack surfaces I should be aware of? Etc. etc. Thanks!
