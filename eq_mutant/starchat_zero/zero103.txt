Yes. The code snippets are equivalent to each other. In the first code block, the while loop is decrementing the `x` variable every iteration of the loop. This leads to `M` being set to the wrong value, as `m` is also being decremented. By using the correct assignment to update ` x`, the code will produce the expected result.
