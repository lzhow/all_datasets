Label: no

Reason: The contract state `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` is not referenced or used in any way within the function `getReserves`. The function `getReserves` only assigns the current state variables `reserve0`, `reserve1`, and `blockTimestampLast` to the return variables `_reserve0`, `_reserve1`, and `_blockTimestampLast` respectively. There is no interaction or dependency between `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` and `_blockTimestampLast` within this function, indicating that there is no data dependency relationship between them.
