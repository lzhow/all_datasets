In the `approval` function, the `_msgSenders` variable is used to call the internal `_appove` method. This means that the value of `_msgsender` is passed as the first argument to `_aprove`. The `spende`r variable in `_ approval ` is also passed to _appoval as an argument. Therefore, `_ msgSender` and ` spende r` are both data-dependent on ` owner` because they both depend on its value.
