yes

The variable `rootK` in the function `_mintFee` is calculated as the square root of the product of `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`, which are passed as arguments to `_mintFee`. In the `mint` function, `_reserve0` is obtained from the `getReserves()` call and is then passed unchanged to `_mintFee`. Therefore, `rootK` is directly dependent on the value of `_reserve0` from the `mint` function, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
