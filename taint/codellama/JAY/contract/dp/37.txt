  
No, the ` success  ` variable in ` sell ` is not dependent on ` value ` in  the  function  sell.

The `  success `variable is a local variable that is declared in function` sell` and is used to check if the transfer of Ether to the developer's wallet was successful. It is set to `true` if `msg .sender .call {value : eth .mul (9  ) .div (1  })` is successful, and `false` otherwise. This variable is only used within the scope of the`s sell function, so it is independent of any other variables in other functions.
