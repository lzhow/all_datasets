  
No, the `_ status` variable in this function `nonReentry` is a private variable that is used to track whether the contract is currently in a reentrance state. It is set to `_NOT ENTERED` initially, and it can be set by calling the `paused` function. Therefore, this variable is under the control of the smart contract and not under user control.
