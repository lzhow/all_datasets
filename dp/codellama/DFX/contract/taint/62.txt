The variable _`baseweight` is a function parameter, which means that it can be controlled only by external users. It is passed as an argument to the `viewnumerairbalanceLPratio` function, and it cannot be modified within the contract. Therefore, the value of `_` baseweight is determined by an external user and is therefore controlled.
