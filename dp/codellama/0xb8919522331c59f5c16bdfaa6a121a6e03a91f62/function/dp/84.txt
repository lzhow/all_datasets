  
The label is 'No'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `ifAdmin()` modifier is used to check if the caller is an admin. If the condition is true, then the `_change_admin()` function is called with the argument `address new_Admin`. The `_CHANGE_ADMIN_` slot is not used in this function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the state and the input variable.
