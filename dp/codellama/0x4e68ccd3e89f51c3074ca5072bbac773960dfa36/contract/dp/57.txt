  
No, the variables ` add` and ` sqrtratiobx9` are independent.

The variable add is a boolean variable that is passed as an argument to the ` getnextsqrtpricfromamount0roundingup` function. It is not used in any calculation or comparison within the body of the  `  getamount1delta`function. Therefore, it is independent of `sqrtratiorbX 9`.
