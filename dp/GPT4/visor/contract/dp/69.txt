Reason: The variable `a` in the function `mod` is data dependent on the variable `b` in the same function `mod`. This is because the operation `a % b` directly uses both `a` and `b` to compute the modulo. The result of the modulo operation is dependent on the values of both `a` and `b`. If the value of `b` changes, it could potentially change the result of `a % b`, hence there is a data dependency relationship between `a` and `b`.
