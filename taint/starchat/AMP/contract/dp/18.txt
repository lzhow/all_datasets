The contract has a function called `_transfer` which is used to transfer tokens between two accounts. This function takes in a `_data` parameter which specifies the partition to which the tokens should be transferred.

In the `_remove` function, we can see that the balances of the sender and recipient are updated based on their partitions. We can also see the `totalPartition` and `indexOfPartitionTotal` mappings which are used for keeping track of all the partitions that a user has tokens in. 

However, there is no mention of a dependency between the two. Therefore, it is not clear if the state of `_partitions` is dependent on `_from`.
