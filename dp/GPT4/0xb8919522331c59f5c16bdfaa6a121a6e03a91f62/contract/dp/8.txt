Label: no

Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` and the variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` are parameters of two separate functions. They are not related to each other within the scope of their respective functions, and there is no code in the provided Solidity contract that establishes a data dependency between them. Each function operates independently, and the value of one does not influence or depend on the value of the other within the given context.
