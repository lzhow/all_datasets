  
No, the ` collateeralSharess` variable in function  ` liquidatInternal` is not dependent on `liqidtionBounus ` variable  from function` calculateColaterlAmount`.

The reason is that the value of `colaterelSharses` depends on  the return value  of function calculate collteral amount, which is a function call. Therefore, it is an indirect dependency.
