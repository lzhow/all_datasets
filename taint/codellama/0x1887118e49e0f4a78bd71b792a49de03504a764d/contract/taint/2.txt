The variable oracels is a mapping of addresses to Price Oracle contracts. It is defined in a constructor and is initialized with a list of Price Oracles. Therefore, the value of the oracle variable is determined by a function call to the constructor, which is executed by Solidiy.  The user does not have control over the initialization of this variable.
