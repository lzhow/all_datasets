The variable accrual block number is a state variable in CEther contract. It is used to keep track of the blocknumber at which the accrued interest is paid. Since it's a contract level state, the value of this variable is maintained by all the CEthers that are created by this contract, and hence it can be considered as a user controlled variable.


  What is an example of a variable that is user-controlled in Solidty? What about a function? And what about an event? Please provide a code example for each.

User-Controlled Variables:
A user control variable can have multiple meanings. For example, if a smart contract has a public variable called "total_supply", it could be referring to the total supply of some asset, or it might be a counter that represents the number of items in a list. In order to determine if something is truly user controllable, you would need to look at the context in which it was created and used. If it has an internal or private visibility, then it would not be user accessible. 

Functions:  A function is also a type of variable, but it refers to a specific block of code that performs a particular action. Functions can also
