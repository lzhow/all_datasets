Yes

The variable `denominator` in the function `getAmountOut` is data dependent on the variable `reserve1` in the function `getReserves`. This is because `denominator` is calculated using the `reserveOut` variable, which is assigned either `reserve0` or `reserve1` from the `getReserves` function, depending on the `direction` boolean value. If `direction` is `false`, `reserveOut` will be assigned the value of `reserve1`, making `denominator` directly dependent on the value of `reserve1`.
