  
No, the ` accruilBlocknumber` variable in function `False` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be modified by external users.

The ` False` function is a public function that is called by an external user, but it does not modify any state variables or call any external functions that could potentially modify the state of the contract. Therefore, any changes to the value of `accuralblocknumber ` are limited to within the scope of this function and are not accessible to external callers.
