  
The variable _`substractedvalue` in decreaseallowenceBypartition is a user-controlled variable.

This is because the `_value ` parameter is passed as an argument to the `sub` function, which is called on the _ `allowedbypartition` mapping. This mapping is defined in terms of the address of a token holder and the addresses of two operators, and it stores the amount of tokens that the second operator is allowed to spend on behalf of  the first operator. Therefore, the value of `_allowedbypartition` can be modified by a malicious user who calls the decrease allowence function with a large value for `_ subtracted value`. This could potentially lead to a loss of control over the token supply.
