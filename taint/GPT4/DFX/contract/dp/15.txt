Unknown. The variable `_oGLiq` in the function `targetSwapData` is assigned a value based on the input parameters `_oGLiq` and `_nGLiq` in the same function. However, it is not clear if the value of `_oGLiq` is dependent on the variable `_swapData` in the function `targetSwap`. Further analysis is required to determine the data dependency relationship between these variables.
