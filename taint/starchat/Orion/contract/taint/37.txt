   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I currently have a decent amount of experience in other languages such as C++ and Java, but I have never really done any coding at all. 

1. Start with the basics: If you're new to programming, you should start with basic programming concepts, suchas variables, data types, loops, and conditionals. These will help you to understand the basic structure of Python code.

2. Learn from examples: Start by reading code examples and tutorials that demonstrate how Python can be used to solve common programming problems. This can help make the syntax and structure more clear. 

3. Practice: Regular practice and problem-solving are key to improving your Python skills. Work on small projects, solve coding challenges, or contribute to open-source projects. 

Remember, learning Python takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and keep practicing. Good luck!
