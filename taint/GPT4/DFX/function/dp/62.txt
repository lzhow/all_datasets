Explanation: The variable `_totalShells` in the function `proportionalDeposit` is data dependent on the variable `balances_` in the function `getGrossLiquidityAndBalancesForDeposit`. This is because the value of `_totalShells` is calculated based on the value of `_oGLiq`, which is obtained from the `grossLiquidity_` variable in the `getGrossLiquidityAndBalancesForDeposit` function. Since `grossLiquidity_` is calculated using the `balances_` variable, there is a data dependency between `_totalShells` and `balances_`.
