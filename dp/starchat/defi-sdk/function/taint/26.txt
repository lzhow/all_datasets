The variable owner_ is a state variable in Solidty contracts that stores the address of the owner of a contract. It is used to restrict access to certain functions and ensure that only the contract owner can perform certain actions.

Since the ownership of this contract is transferred to a new address when the token sale is successful, the value of owner will be updated to the new owner's address. This means that the state of `ownser_` will change over time, and therefore it can be considered to be controlled and influenced by users.


  What is an example of an action that can only be performed by a specific address?  What about an address that is allowed to perform any action?
What is another example? What are some examples of actions that are allowed for any address, or any combination of addresses? How do you determine if an arbitrary address can do something? Is it possible to determine that for all possible inputs? If so, how? Are there any shortcuts or approximations that you can use to make the determination more efficient? For example, if you know that a certain address is associated with a particular type of action, can you simplify the problem by only considering actions of that type? Can you do the same for other
