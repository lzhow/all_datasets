In the `function` ` get _D`, the local variable` D` is not directly dependent on any external variable. However, the value of ` D ` is calculated using the values of other variables, such as `xp`, `amp`, and `N _CO INS`. These variables are passed as arguments to the` get` _xp` function, which is called within the body of the `_D ` function.
However, it is unclear whether the variables ` factory` and` pool` are used to calculate the final value for ` x p` within ` _get _ x _p`. Therefore, we cannot determine whether `x p `is data-dependent on ` factor y` or not.
