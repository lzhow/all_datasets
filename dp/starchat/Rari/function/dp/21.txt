The function flyWheelPretransferAction is called by the flywhell transfer function in cErc20.sol. This function is used to update the borrow index and distribute COMP to suppliers and borrowers.

In the distribute borrow function, the code sets the comp borrow state index to the market borrowindex. Then it calculates the delta index between the current borrow and the previous borrow. It then calculates how much COMP should be distributed to each borrowed account.
