yes

The variable `hashedProtocolFeeSignatureData` in the function `validateProtocolFeeSignature` is data dependent on the variable `protocolFeeSignature` in the same function. This is because `hashedProtocolFeeSignatureData` is computed using the `hashProtocolFeeSignatureData` function, which takes `protocolFeeSignature` as one of its arguments. The `protocolFeeSignature` variable contains the signature and deadline that are used to compute the hash, making `hashedProtocolFeeSignatureData` directly dependent on the data contained in `protocolFeeSignature`.
