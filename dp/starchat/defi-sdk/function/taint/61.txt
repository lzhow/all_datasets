The variable `isUsedHash` is a private variable in `SignatureVerifier` contract. It is used to check if a hash has already been used. Since it's a mapping, the key is `bytes` and the value is of type `bool`. The value of the mapping is set to `true` when the hash is verified and set back to false when it fails verification.

Since the `hash` function in this contract is called by other functions, and since the `_hashUsed` mapping can be modified by those functions to mark hashes as used, we can conclude that the state of `_isHasUsed_` is controllable by users.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the purpose of each function and how they all fit together. I also don't understand why the signature verification is necessary, since it seems like the contract can just be a simple list of hashes. Can the attacker just add their own hashes to the list? How does the verification work? Can I just use the EVM to verify the signatures? What if I wanted to use a different blockchain? Would I have to rewrite the entire contract? Is there a way to do this without modifying the original code? Please explain it
