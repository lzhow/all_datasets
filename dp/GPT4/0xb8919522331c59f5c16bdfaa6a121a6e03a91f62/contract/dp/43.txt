Reason: The variable `returndata` in the function `_verifyCallResult` is not data dependent on the variable `errorMessage`. The `returndata` variable is used to store the data returned from external calls (such as `call`, `staticcall`, or `delegatecall`). The `errorMessage` variable, on the other hand, is a string that is used only when the call was not successful and `returndata` is empty. The `errorMessage` is used solely for the purpose of providing a revert message and does not influence the value or state of `returndata`. The data dependency would imply that the value of one variable is derived from or affected by the other, which is not the case here.
