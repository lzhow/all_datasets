Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_token` in the function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmountExternal` and the variable `_token` in the function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityAmountExternal` are both parameters of their respective functions. These functions are external and can be called with potentially the same ERC20 token address. Since both functions are part of the same contract and are likely to operate on the same state variables that are associated with the `_token` address (as indicated by the pattern of the contract's functions), there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables. They both reference the same contract state (the state associated with the ERC20 token address passed to the functions), even though they are parameters in different functions. The state they reference and potentially modify is dependent on the ERC20 token address, which is represented by the `_token` variable in both functions.
