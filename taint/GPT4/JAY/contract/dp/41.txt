Yes

The variable `amount` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the same function. This is because `amount` is calculated by summing up the values from the `amounts` array. The line `amount = amount.add(amounts[id]);` within the for loop iterates over each `id` and adds the corresponding value from the `amounts` array to the `amount` variable, thus creating a direct data dependency between `amount` and `amounts`.
