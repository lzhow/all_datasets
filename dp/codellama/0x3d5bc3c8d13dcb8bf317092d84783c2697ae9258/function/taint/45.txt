  
The variable 'newpendingadmin' in function '_setpengingadmin()' is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the 'msg' variable is used to check if it matches the admin address. If the msg variable does not match the address of the administrator, the transaction will fail. Therefore, ' newpanding admin' can only be set by an authorized user, and the contract is secure.
