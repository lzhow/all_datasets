Explanation: The variable `totalSupply` in the function `initialize` is not controlled by the user. It is used to call the `totalSupply` function of the `EIP20Interface` contract, which retrieves the total supply of the underlying token. The value of `totalSupply` is determined by the underlying token contract and is not directly controlled by the user.
