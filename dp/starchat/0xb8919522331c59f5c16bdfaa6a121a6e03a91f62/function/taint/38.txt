   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to the server during development. This is achieved by bundLING (or bundlinG) together (bundling) all the files that are required to render a web page, including JavaScript files, CSS files and images, into a single file that can be served to a browser. An incremental bundle is created by comparing the dependencies between the different files in a project and only bunding the changes since the last bundle. By doing so, the incremental build process can significantly reduce the time taken to update the browser when changes are made. Incremental bundlers can also optimize caching by including a hash of the file contents in its name, allowing the tool to determine if a cached version of a file is still valid. Tools like
