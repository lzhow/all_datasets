Reason: The variable `err0` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, but assuming it is meant to be the first part of the tuple returned by the `mulExp` function, it would represent a `MathError`. The `mulExp` function takes two parameters `a` and `b`, creates two new `Exp` structs with their `mantissa` properties set to `a` and `b` respectively, and then calls itself recursively (which seems like an error in the code as it would result in infinite recursion). However, the `mulExp` function is marked as `pure`, which means it does not read from or modify the state of the contract. It operates only on its input parameters.

The `sub_` function is also marked as `pure` and takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and an error message. It performs a subtraction operation after a `require` statement that checks if `b` is less than or equal to `a`.

Since both functions are `pure` and do not share state or call each other, and there is no indication that the result of `sub_` is passed to `mulExp`, there is no data dependency between the variable `err0` in `mulExp` and the variable `b` in `sub_`. They operate independently with their own scoped parameters.
