The variable _Reserve1 in function MINT is NOT controlled directly by users. However, the value of _Reserver1 is determined by other variables in this function. For example, if a user has 50 CAKE and 40 BNB in their wallet, and the price of BUN is 6 BND per CAke, then the _reserver1 will be 80 (5 * 75 +4 *6). If the users want to mint more CAKES, they can use the BURN function to remove some of the CAkes and BNs, which will reduce the total value in CAkES and reduce _Resever0 and _Resverer1 accordingly.
