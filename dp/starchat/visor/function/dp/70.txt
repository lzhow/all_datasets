The function ``recover`` takes in four parameters: ``hash``, ``v``,``r``, and ``s``. The function then checks if the value of ``uint(2)s`` is less than or equal to 7237005583364862295930424965267788063840891199412131797539854344716103, which is approximately 1.8 * 3^3 * pi^2. This value is known as the "Naf Nibble" and is used to prevent certain types of attacks on elliptic curve cryptography.

Next, the program checks to see if `` v`` equals either  ``2`` or ``3``. These values are used in eliptic curve signatures to indicate the curve used for the signature. If the values of v are neither ``2``, nor ``V``, the code will revert the transaction. 

After the checks for ``Nibbles`` and the ``'v`` parameter, we arrive at the ecrcover function
