Label: yes

Reason: The contract state `buyNftFeeJay` is data dependent on the variable `value` in the function `sell`. This can be inferred from the fact that the variable `value` is used as an argument in the `_burn` function, which suggests that it affects the state of the contract. Since the state of `buyNftFeeJay` can be modified by `_burn`, it is data dependent on `value`.
