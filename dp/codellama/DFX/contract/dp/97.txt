  
No, the variables ` curves _` and `_ oBALS` are independent.

The variable  ` _ o BAL S` is defined in `getGrosLiquefactionAndBallances` function, which is called in  the ` proportional Withdraw`function. However, this function does not modify the value of `_obals`. Therefore, `_ obals ` is not dependent on ` curves _`.
