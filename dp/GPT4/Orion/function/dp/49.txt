Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `D` in the function `get_D` is not directly dependent on the variable `A` in the function `getAmountInCurve`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `A` in the code snippet provided. However, it is possible that `A` indirectly affects the value of `D` through the `get_y` function, which is not included in the code snippet. Without the implementation of `get_y`, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between `D` and `A`. Therefore, the label is unknown.
