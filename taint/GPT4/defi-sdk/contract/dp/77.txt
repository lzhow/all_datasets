Label: no

Reason: The variable `amountOut` in the function `getAmountIn` and the variable `amountInWithFee` in the function `getAmountOut` are local variables within their respective functions. They are calculated independently of each other and are scoped to their functions, meaning they do not share state or influence each other's values. The data dependency would require that the value of one variable directly affects the computation of the other, which is not the case here. Each function calculates its own variables based on its own parameters and the state of the contract, but there is no direct data flow between `amountOut` in `getAmountIn` and `amountInWithFee` in `getAmountOut`.
