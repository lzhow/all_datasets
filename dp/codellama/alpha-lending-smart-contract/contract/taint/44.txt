  
No, the `_ symbol` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is passed as an argument to `ER2C` constructor.

The `symbol()` function in `Alpha Token` contract returns the symbol of the token, which is set to "Alpha" in this case. This symbol is a public constant variable that can be accessed by anyone, and it cannot be changed by any user action. Therefore, `_Symbol` in constructor is also not user-controlled.
