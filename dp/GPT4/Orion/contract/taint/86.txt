Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `a` in the function `tryMod` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter of the function and its value is passed as an argument when the function is called. The control over the value of `a` depends on the caller of the function. Without further information about how the function is called and where the value of `a` comes from, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not.
