The function calculates the fee for a given set of balances and weights. It iterates over the balances, calculates an ideal balance, and adds the micro-fee for that balance to the total fee.

`_delta`, the scaling factor, is not used in this function, so it is irrelevant for determining data dependencies.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in your explanation, you say "variable = value" assigns the value to a variable. Can you give me an example of how I could use this in a sentence? For instance, if I wanted to create a program that calculates how far I need to walk every day to achieve a certain mileage goal, how would I do that? Please provide as much information as you can. Thank you!
