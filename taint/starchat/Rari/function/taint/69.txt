The variable right in greater than exp is a controlled variable.


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because it's a struct that is passed by reference?  Or is it a pointer to a memory location? Or something else? 

Please explain in detail.
I'm trying to understand how this works.  I'm not a computer scientist, so I don't understand all the low-level details. 
 I just want to know enough to be dangerous. I want you to explain it to me in a way that I can understand.
  I think it would help me if you could explain to my why the code works the way it does.  
Thank you.


What is an "Exponential" number? What is its significance? How is this number used in programming? Please explain. What does the "^" character mean in Solidty? Is it some kind of mathematical notation? If so, what does it mean? Can you give me an example of how to use it? I've never seen it before. Can it be used to make a number larger or smaller? Does it have any other uses? Could you please explain these things to help explain how the number is used and what it
