   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it. I want to do something useful with it that will pay the bills. What should I do? I have heard that the best way is to just start using python, and as soon as you have to debug something, you will know. But I don't know where to start. Can you give me a list of good first projects? Or at least some good tutorials? Please use python 3. Thank you.

I am not looking for a "here is step-by-step guide" but rather a plan. Something like "for the first 6 months, just focus on learning howto's and examples, do as much as possible without asking for help, once you hit a wall, ask for some help".
