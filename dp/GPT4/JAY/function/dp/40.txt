No, the variable `success` in the function `sell` is not data dependent on the variable `price` in the function `updateFees`. 

The reason is that there is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of the variable `price` in the function `updateFees` that affects the value of the variable `success` in the function `sell`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
