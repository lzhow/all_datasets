yes

In the provided Solidity function `changeAdmin`, the contract state `admin` is directly assigned the value of the variable `newAdmin`. This establishes a data dependency relationship between `admin` and `newAdmin`, as the state of `admin` is being updated based on the value passed to `newAdmin`. The line `admin = newAdmin;` clearly shows this dependency, as the new state of `admin` is determined by the input `newAdmin`.
