  
No, the data of the state variable `_ total Partitions ` is not dependent on ` last Value ` in function` _ removePartitonFrom TotalPartions `.

The reason is that the ` _ total partitions ` state is an array of bytes 3 2 , and the` last value ` variable is a bytes  3  2  value.
In the `_ remove Partitons From Total Partions` function, `Last Value` is used to replace the last element of `Total Parts` array, but this does not affect the value of `_ Total Supply` state. Therefore, `_Total Supplies` and `_Part Total` are independent.
