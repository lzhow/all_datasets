The  variable  "_decimal" is defined  as  private  constant  within  this  function  constructor  ,  which  means  that  it  cannot  be  changed  or  modified  after  its  initialization  .   The  value  1  8  for  decimal  places  was  chosen  because  most  tokens  have   a   decimal   point  with   eight  digits  to   the  right  side  (  ETH  has   six  decmial  points  ) . This  choice  allows  users  who  are  using  these  contracts  on  exchanges  such  us  Uniswap  V2  can  easily  convert  between  different  token  types  without  having  any  issues  related  conversion  errors .
