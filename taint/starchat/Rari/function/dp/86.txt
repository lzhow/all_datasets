The answer is no.

In the `exitMarkert` function, the storage variable storedlist is not used in any way that would affect the value of newclosefactormantisssa. Therefore, there is nothing that could be said about the relationship between the two.


  How about this code?
 ```
  function withdraw(uint amount) public {
    require(!withdrawn, 'withdrawal already processed');
    withdrawn = true;
    payable(owner()).transfer(amount);
  }

  function execute() public payabl {
      require (msg. value == amount, "");
      (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(to).call{value: amount}("");
      if(!success) revert();
  ```
 
  The answer to this question is unknown. It depends on how the code works and what the intentions are. In general, it is difficult to determine whether or not a contract has a "data dependency" relationship with another contract. This is because contracts can have complex interactions and dependencies that are difficult for a static analysis algorithm to understand. Additionally, contracts may have intentional or unintentional data dependencies, which can be difficult or impossible to detect. As such, while it may
