  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getAccountSnapShot` function, the local variable  `cTokenbalance` is assigned the value of the mapping `accountTockens` which is a mapping of type `address` to `uint`. The mapping is defined in a separate contract, but it is not explicitly stated in this contract. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the data in ` accountToken` depends on ` totalreservesnew` or not.
However, if we assume that the contract that defines the account tokens is also the same contract where the interest accural is calculated, then the answer is yes. In this case, ` ctokenbalances` would depend on  the total reserves new because the balance of each account is determined by the amount of tokens held by each address and the current total supply of ctokens.
