Label: no

Reason: The variable `cardinalityNext` in the `initialize` function is not controlled by the user. It is set to a constant value of `1` within the function and does not take any external input or parameters that could be influenced by the user. The function `initialize` is designed to set up the initial state of the observations array with a predefined cardinality and does not allow for user input to determine the value of `cardinalityNext`.
