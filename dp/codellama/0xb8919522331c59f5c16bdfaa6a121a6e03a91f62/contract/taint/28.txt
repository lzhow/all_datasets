The variable is declared as a constant, which means that its value cannot be changed after it has been initialized. Therefore, the value of `_ BEAC ON_ SLOT ` is determined at compile time and is fixed for the entire duration of the contract. It is therefore not possible for a user to control the contents of this variable.
