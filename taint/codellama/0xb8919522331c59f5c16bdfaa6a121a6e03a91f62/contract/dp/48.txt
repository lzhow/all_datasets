In the ` functionfunctionCallwithValue` function, the` value` variable is passed as an argument to the low level call function. This means that the value of ` value ` is dependent on ` data`.
Similarly, in `FunctionStaticcall`, the same `Value ` variable  is used as the argument for the call. Therefore, ` Value ` and ` Data ` are dependent variables.
