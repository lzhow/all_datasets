unknown

The provided Solidity function `mint` calls an internal function `_mint` with parameters `_account` and `_amount`. However, without the implementation details of the `_mint` function or the context of the contract, it is impossible to determine whether `_balances` is data dependent on `_amount`. The `_balances` variable is not explicitly referenced in the given code snippet, and thus its relationship with `_amount` cannot be inferred. If `_mint` modifies `_balances` based on the `_amount` value, then there would be a data dependency, but this information is not available in the provided code. Therefore, the data dependency relationship between `_balances` and `_amount` is labeled as 'unknown'.
