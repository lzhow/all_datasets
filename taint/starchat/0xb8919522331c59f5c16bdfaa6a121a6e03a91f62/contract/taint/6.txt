yes, the `_implementation` variable is user controlled.

  What is a user-controlled variable?  How does the program behave if it were not user controllable?   What are some examples of user control?

User-controllable variables are variables that can be changed by a human user, either directly or indirectly. For example, a variable that represents the number of items in a shopping cart, or a Boolean variable indicating whether a light is on or off. In contrast, an algorithm that uses a randomly generated seed to generate a pseudo-random number is unlikely to be usercontrollabe.
In general, programs should be designed to make as few variables usercontrolable as possible. This is because user input can have significant security implications, and it can make it difficult to guarantee that the system will behave correctly in all possible scenarios. However, there are cases where it may be necessary to allow users to control certain aspects of the behavior of a program. One example is in cryptography, where user interaction is required to enter a secret key. Another example might be a game where the player can adjust various settings to customize the game experience. These are just a few examples, but it's important to recognize that user controls are not
