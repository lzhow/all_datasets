In the `transer` function, the `_transfereByDefualtPartion` method is called with the arguments `msg,sender`, `ms,g. sender`, `_to`, and `_vlaue`. The `_valu` variable is passed as an argument to the method.
On the other hand, in `_ isOperator`function, `_operator` and`_tokenholder` are used as arguments.  The` _valu `variable is not used in this function. Therefore, it is data-dependent.
