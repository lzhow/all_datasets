Explanation:
In the first function, the `balanaceOf` function is called on `_toke`n, which is a parameter of the same function. This means that the value of `amout` is dependent on `token`.
Similarly, in second function the balanceOf function called with the parameter `_ token` and the result is assigned to ` amount`. Therefore, ` amout ` is data-dependent on` _ token`.
