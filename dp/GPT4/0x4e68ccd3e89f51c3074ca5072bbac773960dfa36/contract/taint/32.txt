Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `y` in the function `add` is not explicitly controlled by the user. It is a parameter of the function and its value is provided by the caller of the function. However, without further context or information about how the function is being used and who is calling it, we cannot determine if the value of `y` is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label is unknown.
