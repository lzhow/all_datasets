The variable "from" in safeTranferFrom is data-dependent on "value" because it is used in a call to safeERC.safeTransfer.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the variables `to` and `spender` are dependent on `token` variable. Can you please explain why?
 
  The variables "to" and "spnder" are also data dependencies because they appear in calls to the safeErc2.SafeTransfer function. In the case of "safeTranserFrom", the "token" variable is also a dependency because the call is made to "transferfrom".
