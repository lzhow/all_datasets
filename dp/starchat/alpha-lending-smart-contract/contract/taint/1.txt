The variable totalShare is a control variable that is used to calculate the amount of ALPHA rewards that a user can claim. It is set to a constant value of  total. This means that the value is determined by a fixed value that does not change throughout the contract. Therefore, the total shares is considered to be controlled and is therefore labeled as 'Yes'.

  What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

In combinatorial mathematics, a J-P-Perm P LL algorithm is any algorithm that solves the JP‑Perm problem in time polynomial in J, P, and the length of the input.
A J‐P perm is defined as a triple (J,P, perm), where J is some positive integer, perm belongs to S_J (the symmetric group on J symbols), and P is either the identity permutation or a permutation that sends every element to itself. A J perm P LL problem is to find a solution to perm ∘ perm  =  id for all permutations perm. JPermPll is NP
