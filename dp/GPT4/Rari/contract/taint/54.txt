Explanation: The variable `blockNumber` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not controlled by the user. It is obtained from the `getBlockNumber()` function, which is a built-in function in Solidity that returns the current block number. The value of `blockNumber` is determined by the blockchain network and is not influenced by user input. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
