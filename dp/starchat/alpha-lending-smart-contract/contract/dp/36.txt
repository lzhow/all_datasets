   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high- level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

Here are some steps you can follow to get started with Python:

1. Choose a Python environment: There are several ways to run Python code, including using a local installation of Python, online tools like repl.it, or a cloud-based service like Google Colab.

2. Learn the basics: The official Python tutorial is excellent and provides a gentle introduction to Python concepts. It's a great place to start if you're new to programming. Other resources include Codecademy's Python course and freeCodeCamp's introduction course on Python. 

3. Practice: As you learn Python you'll want to put what you've learned to use. Start with simple programs and gradually move on to more complex ones. HackerRank and LeetCode are excellent resources for practice. 

Remember that Python is widely used in industry and academia, so there are many resources
