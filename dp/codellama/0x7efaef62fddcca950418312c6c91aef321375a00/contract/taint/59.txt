  
No, the `_ token  ` variable in function `skim` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and is only accessible within that function. It is created and destroyed every time the `skin` function is called, and its value is determined by other variables in that scope.

The reason for this is that the value of `_tokens` in ` sk` cannot be changed by any external user, as it does not have any public setter function, so it cannot  be modified by a user outside of the contract.
