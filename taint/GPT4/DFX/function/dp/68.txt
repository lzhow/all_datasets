Explanation: The variable `_deposit` in the function `proportionalDeposit` is data dependent on the variable `_baseWeight` in the function `viewProportionalDeposit`. This is because in both functions, `_baseWeight` is used in the calculation of `deposits_[i]`. In `proportionalDeposit`, `_baseWeight` is used as an argument in the `Assimilators.intakeNumeraireLPRatio` function, while in `viewProportionalDeposit`, `_baseWeight` is used as an argument in the `Assimilators.viewRawAmountLPRatio` function. Therefore, the value of `_baseWeight` in `viewProportionalDeposit` affects the value of `deposits_[i]` in `proportionalDeposit`, indicating a data dependency between the two variables.
