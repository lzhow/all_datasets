Reason: In the function `functionStaticCall`, the variable `success` is set based on the result of the `staticcall` operation, which is directly invoked with the variable `data` as an argument. The `staticcall` is a low-level operation in Solidity that executes a read-only call to another contract using the provided `data`. The success of this call, and thus the value of the `success` variable, is dependent on the `data` provided, as different `data` can lead to different execution paths and outcomes in the called contract. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `success` and `data` within the `functionStaticCall` function.
