  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `updateContibutorReards` function, the value of `compContriubtorSpees` is updated based on `block.timestamp`. This means that the state of the smart contract is dependent on external factors, specifically the block timestamp.
When the user calls the`gratComp`function, it calls `getAllmarkers` which returns the array of all markets, and the loop iterates over the markerts and calls`updateCompborrrowindex` and `distributeborowercomp` functions. These functions depend on`compborowstate` state, which is also updated in `updatetContiributorewards` basedon the external factor ` blocktimestamp`
Therefore, ` lastcontributoblock`is data-dependent on variable ` in function` grantcompinternal`.
