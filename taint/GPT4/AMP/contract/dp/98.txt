Reason: The variable `_from` in the function `swap` represents the address from which the swap is initiated. It is used to check the allowance and perform the token transfer from that address. On the other hand, the function `isPartitionStrategy` takes a `bytes4 _prefix` as an argument and checks if a given partition strategy prefix is registered in the `_isPartitionStrategy` mapping. There is no direct or indirect relationship between the `_from` variable in the `swap` function and the empty variable (which seems to be a typo or placeholder for an argument) in the `isPartitionStrategy` function. They operate on different data and have different purposes within the contract, with no code indicating a dependency between them.
