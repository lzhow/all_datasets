  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `FullMath` library, the two functions ` muldiv` and `mldivRoundUp` both use the same variable name ` denominatior`. This means that the value of ` denomintor` is shared between the functions, and any changes made to the state of the contract in one function will be reflected in other functions that use that same state. Therefore, `Denominatir` has a dependency on ` Denominatr` .
