  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `intakRawandGetbalance` function, the `_amt` variable is passed as an argument to the ABI encode function. This means that the value of `_amount` is used to encode the data that is sent to `delegate` method.
On the other hand, in `OutputRawGetBanlance`, the same variable, `_amnt`, is also used as a parameter to ABE encode. Therefore, `amount_`, which is returned by the delegate method, is dependent on `_ammount`.
Therefore, we can conclude that `amunt_ ` in` intakrawandgetbalanc`e is data-dependent on` _ammout`in` outputrawgetbanlanc`.
