In the `mul` function of the provided Solidity code, the variable `z` is directly calculated by multiplying the input variables `x` and `y` (`z = x * y`). Therefore, the value of `z` is dependent on the value of `y`. If `y` changes, `z` will also change, assuming `x` is not zero. This establishes a data dependency relationship between `z` and `y` within the `mul` function.
