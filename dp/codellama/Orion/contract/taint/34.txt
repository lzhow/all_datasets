  
No, the ` amount  ` variable in function `_swap` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameters of the `_ swap` function.

The ` _ swap ` function takes in several parameters, including `input`, `output`, and `to`. The ` input ` and` output ` parameters are the addresses of two ERC-21 tokens, and the` to ` parameter is an address that represents the recipient of tokens. Based on these parameters and some calculations, a new variable called ` amounts ` is created, which is a list of token amounts that will be transferred.  The` amount `  variable is then calculated as the first element of this list. Therefore, ` amoun0 `out is determined by ` inputs `,` outputs `and` amounts `.
