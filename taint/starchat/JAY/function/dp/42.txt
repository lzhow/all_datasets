Yes, `variable total` is data-dependent on `array ercs712TokenAddresses`. This is because the `for` loop in `function buyrJays` iterates over the elements of the array `ercs1751tokenAddresses`, and each time it increments the value of `i`, the new value is assigned to `totoal`.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  Sure! The `require` statement in Solidiy is a way to enforce certain conditions in your code. In this case, the condition is that the contract has not started yet. If the start variable is set to false, then the require statement will throw an error and stop the execution of your contract.

However, it's important to note that Solidty does not have access to the state of variables outside of its own scope. This means that even if the variables are declared outside the scope of a function, Solidit does no have visibility into them.
