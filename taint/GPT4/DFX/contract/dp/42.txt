yes

The variable `_amt` in the function `viewOriginSwapData` is dependent on the variable `_nGLiq` in the function `viewOriginSwap`. This is because the value of `_nGLiq` is used in the calculation of `_amt` in the `viewOriginSwapData` function. Any changes to the value of `_nGLiq` will affect the value of `_amt`.
