Explanation: The variable `_unlockTime` in the function constructor is not controlled by the user. It is passed as a parameter to the constructor function and is set by the contract deployer at the time of contract deployment. The contract deployer is typically the user who deploys the contract, but once the contract is deployed, the value of `_unlockTime` cannot be changed by any user. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
