  
The variable _`indexOf`Total Partitions is a mapping that maps a partition to its index in _Total partitions. It is used to keep track of the order of partitions in which they were added to the contract.

Since this variable is created and managed by Solidiy, and its value is determined by how the partitions are added and removed from the total partitions array, the value of this mapping is ultimately controlled and determined  by  the  contract  itself,  and  not  directly  controlled  or  manipulated  through  any  user  input. Therefore, this label is 'No'.
