Reason: The variable `_rewardToken` in the `initialize` function is used to set the `rewardToken` state variable of the contract when initializing. It is independent of any other operations and is only set once during the initialization process.

On the other hand, the variable `amount` in the function `grantCompInternal` is used to transfer a certain amount of the reward token to a user. The value of `amount` is determined by the logic that calls `grantCompInternal` and is used to perform a transfer operation.

There is no direct data dependency between `_rewardToken` and `amount` as they are used in different contexts and for different purposes. `_rewardToken` is used to set an address, while `amount` is used to represent a quantity of tokens to be transferred. There is no code in the provided contract that creates a dependency between the initialization of the reward token address and the amount of tokens to be granted to a user.
