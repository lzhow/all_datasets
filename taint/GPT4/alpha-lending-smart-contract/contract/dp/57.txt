Label: no

Reason: The variable `_token` in the function `setUserPool` and the variable `_shareAmount` in the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmountExternal` do not have a data dependency relationship. The variable `_token` is used to index into the `userPoolData` mapping to store or update user-specific pool data, while `_shareAmount` is an input to a calculation function that returns a computed value. There is no direct interaction or dependency between these two variables within the given functions or across the contract state that would indicate a data dependency. Each variable operates within its own context and serves a different purpose.
