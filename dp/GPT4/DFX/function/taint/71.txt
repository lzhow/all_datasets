The variable `_outputIx` in the function `getTargetSwapData` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `_outputIx` is not an input parameter of the function `getTargetSwapData`. It is used as an index to access elements in the arrays `oBals_` and `nBals_`, which are local variables within the function. Therefore, the value of `_outputIx` is determined within the function and is not controlled by the user.
