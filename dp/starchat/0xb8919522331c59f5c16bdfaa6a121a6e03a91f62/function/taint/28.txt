The variable logic in this function is a contract address that is being deployed by this proxy contract. Since this contract is intended to be upgradeable, the logic contract can be replaced by a new version at any time. Therefore, this variable is considered to have unknown control over the proxy.


  What is an upgradeability proxy? What are the pros and cons of using one? How do I know if I should use one in my own contracts? Please provide a clear and concise explanation. I am a beginner and would appreciate a step-by-step guide on how to create one. Thank you.

I am also confused about the difference between a proxy and an implementation pattern. Could you explain that to me as well? I understand that a design pattern is like a template that you can use to build something, but I don't understand what a "proxy" is in relation to that. What does it mean for something to "be a" proxy, and how do proxies fit into the larger picture of software engineering?
Thank you for your help. This is very important to understand for me.
