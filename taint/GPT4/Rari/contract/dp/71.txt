Label: no

Reason: The variable `distributors` in the function `checkCToken` is a local array that is populated by the return value of the `comptroller.getRewardsDistributors()` function call. It is used within the scope of the `checkCToken` function to check if the current contract (`this`) is added as a rewards distributor.

On the other hand, the variable `contributor` in the function `_setContributorCompSpeed` is a parameter that represents an address of a contributor. It is used to update the rewards speed for that particular contributor and has no direct interaction or relationship with the `distributors` array or the `checkCToken` function.

Since there is no code path where the value of `contributor` would affect the contents of the `distributors` array, or vice versa, we can conclude that there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables.
