Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_pair` in the function `setTokenPairMap` is an input parameter to a public function that does not have any restrictions on who can call it, other than the `onlyOwner` modifier. The `onlyOwner` modifier restricts the function to be called only by the current owner of the contract. However, since the owner is an external user who has control over the contract, the data passed to `_pair` is ultimately controlled by the user (the owner). Therefore, the variable `_pair` is considered to be controlled by the user.
