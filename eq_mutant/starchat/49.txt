No, these two code snippets are **not** semantic equivalent. While the syntactic structure of the code is equivalent, they do not compute the exact same result. In particular, in the second code snippet, there is an additional increment to the loop variable `i`, which causes the calculation of `bonus` to be off by one iteration.
