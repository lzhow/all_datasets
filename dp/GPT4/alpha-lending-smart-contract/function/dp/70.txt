Reason: The variable `_user` in the function `isAccountHealthy` is an input parameter that represents an address of a user's account. It is used to retrieve the user's account information through the `getUserAccount` function call. On the other hand, the variable `_amount` in the function `updateBorrowAlphaReward` is an input parameter that represents an amount to be added to the `totalAlphaTokenReward` of a `Pool` and used to update the `alphaMultiplier`. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `_user` and `_amount` as they operate in different contexts and are used for different purposes within their respective functions. `_user` is related to a user's account health check, while `_amount` is related to the reward calculation for a pool. There is no code indicating that the value of `_user` would influence or be influenced by the value of `_amount`.
