Explanation: The variable `storedList` in the function `exitMarket` is not data dependent on the variable `newCloseFactorMantissa` in the function `_setCloseFactor`. There is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `newCloseFactorMantissa` in the code block of `exitMarket` that involves `storedList`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
