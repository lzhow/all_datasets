The variable `cToken` in `getUnderlayingPrice` is user-controlled because it's passed in by a user and is therefore considered to be user input.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract and their labels?  Also, can you explain how the labels were determined?

Can you also give a label to this contract:
pragma solidity 0; contract A { function f() public pure returns(uint) { return 7; } }





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problems and want to start learning a new language. I have heard that python has the most "bang for your buck" in terms of ease of use, versatility, and community. However, I also heard rumors that it can be difficult to pick up. What do you think? Is it worth it to give it a shot? If so, how do I make the transition? Are there any good books or tutorials that I could follow? Any advice for me to avoid getting stuck? Please help me!
