The two provided codes appear to have differences. While the original code appears to work as intended, the mutated code produces different output than expected. It appears that the addition operation in the second half of the `while` loop is erroneous, and causes the program to continue looping infinitely. The output of both codes is 3 for the input `9`, since 9 is the square root of 81.
