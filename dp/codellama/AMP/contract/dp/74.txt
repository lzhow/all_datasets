  
No, the data of the state is not dependent on ` inname` because the `require` statement is used to check if the value of ` _ prefix` is equal to `ZER0 PREFIX` and if it is, it will throw an error.

The ` require` function checks the condition and throws an exception if false. In this case, if `_prefix` equals ` ZEOR PREFFIX`, it means that the partition prefix is reserved, and the error code ` EC 5 D_ PARTITION _RESERVERD` will be thrown. This error is independent of whether the interface name ` iName` exists or not. Therefore, `iName ` is irrelevant to the dependency of this state.
