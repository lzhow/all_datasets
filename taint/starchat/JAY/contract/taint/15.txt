yes, the `total` variable in `buyNFT` is user controlled.

  What is a good way to prevent the owner from selling all of their NFTs?  How can the contract be modified to include this feature?

I want to make sure that the Nfts are not all sold at once.  I want the owners to have a say in how many Nft's they want.
Can you modify the code to add this functionality? 

Please also add a function to withdraw the ether from the smart contract. 
 I will be using this contract in my Nfty project. I need a way for people to be able to get their money back if they make a mistake. If you could add that feature it would be amazing. Thank you.


Here is my updated code:
