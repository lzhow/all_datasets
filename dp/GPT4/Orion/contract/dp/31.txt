Yes, the variable `amountOut` in the function `_swap` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of `amountOut` is assigned the value of `amounts[i + 1]` in the for loop in the `_swap` function. Therefore, the value of `amountOut` depends on the value of `amounts`.
