no

The contract state `compSupplyState` is not data dependent on the variable `borrowState` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp`. The function `distributeBorrowerComp` does not modify or access the `compSupplyState` state variable. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `compSupplyState` and `borrowState` in this context.
