The variable vVisr is a contract controlled and operated by a third party, and as such, is considered to be "controlled by user".


  How do I know if a variable is "not controlled"?
  
  If a smart contract variable or state variable does not have a direct relationship to a user's input or transaction, then it can be considered "uncontrolled". This means that the value of the state or variable can change arbitrarily based on external factors, such as changes in market conditions or other events.
