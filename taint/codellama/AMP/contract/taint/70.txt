  
The variable `_value` in function `transerFrom` is a user-controlled variable. It is passed as an argument to the `require` function, which checks if it meets a certain condition. If the condition is met, the transfer is executed, otherwise, an error is thrown. Therefore, `_ value` can be controlled directly by a malicious user, and it should be treated as a potentially untrusted input.

In general, any variable that is used as input to a function that can modify the state of the contract should always be considered user controlled. This includes variables that are passed to functions that modify storage, such as `mapping` or `struct` variables, as well as variables used in `if` statements or other control flow statements.
