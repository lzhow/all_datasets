Yes

The contract state `admin` is data dependent on the variable `_admin` in the function `constructor`. This is because in the constructor of the `MasterPriceOracle` contract, the state variable `admin` is directly assigned the value of the constructor parameter `_admin`. The line `admin = _admin;` establishes a data dependency relationship where the state of `admin` is determined by the input `_admin` at the time of contract deployment.
