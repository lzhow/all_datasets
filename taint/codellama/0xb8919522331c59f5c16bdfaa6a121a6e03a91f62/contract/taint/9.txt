  
The variable 'proxy' in getproxyImplemenation is a parameter of the get proxy implementation function. It is passed as an argument to the staticcall function, which is an external function that is called on the proxy contract. Therefore, the value of ' proxy' is determined by whoever calls the 'getProxyimplementation' function and is therefore controlled  by them.

Therefore, we label the control of variable proxy as 'Yes'.
