  
No, the variables ` bitpos` and ` mask_ scope_ 5` are independent.

The reason is that the `position` function only depends on `tick` which is a function parameter, and the value of ` tick` is not changed within the scope of the call to ` position`. Therefore, `wordpos_1` depends only on  `tic_k` , and not on any other variable. Similarly,  the  value  of  bit_pos  is only determined by the result of calling `most_significan_bit` on a value that is determined only by `compresse_d` . Therefore `leas_t_sig_nific_ant_bi_` also depends  only  on`compress_ed`and not  any  other  variable .
