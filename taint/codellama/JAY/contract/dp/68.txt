  
No, the variables ` er c7  n1  d s` and ` success  s  t  w o` are independent.

The variable  `er c 7  2  i d  e s ` is a local variable in function  buy  J  a  y  and is not dependent on any other variable. Similarly, variable   ` s u c c e  ss  tw o `  is also a variable local to function   s e l l  .
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
