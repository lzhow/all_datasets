  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `string memory` variable inname is assigned the value returned by the `_getParitionStratgyValidatorIName()` function. This function takes the input `_ prefix` as an argument. Therefore, ` inName` is dependent on `_Prefix`.
Similarly, In the second function , the same variable is also assigned a value by calling the  `_ getParititionstrategyValidatoriName()` method.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on each other.
