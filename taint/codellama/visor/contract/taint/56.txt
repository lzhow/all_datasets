  
The variable recipients in function `sendValue` is labeled as 'Yes' because it takes in a user-provided address as an argument. This means that the recipent address is under the control of the contract user, and the address can be used to transfer value to any contract or account.

In the context of smart contracts, the term "user" refers to the entity that interacts with the smart contact and provides input to it. In this case, since the `sender` function takes a `payable` address argument, which means the sender can provide a recipien address to which the value will be sent. Therefore, ` recipents` variable is considered under user control.
