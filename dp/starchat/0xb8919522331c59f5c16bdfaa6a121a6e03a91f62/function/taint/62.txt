The variable errorMessage in function call is a user-controlled input and is therefore classified as "yes". The reason for this classification is that the input is used to provide a descriptive error message in case the call fails.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract and label them as either "user controlled" or "not user controlled"?
 
  Yes, here is an updated list with user control classification for all variables:

- userControlled: owner, manager, user, customer, account, wallet, token, amount
 - notUserControlle: errorMessage, name, symbol, price, quantity, total, balance, index, count, id, key, secret, hash, salt, signature, message, content, payload, input, output, result, status, flag, valid, approved, verified, completed, success
Note: This list may not be exhaustive and may be subject to change based on new discoveries.
Please note that this list is for illustration purposes only and does not reflect the actual implementation of the contract. It is important to note the potential security risks associated with each variable and the requirements for their protection. Additionally, the classification of each input may change over
