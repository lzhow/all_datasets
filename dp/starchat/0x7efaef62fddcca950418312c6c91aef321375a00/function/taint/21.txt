The variable "to" in function "_safeTranfer" is a user-controlled variable, as it determines the recipient of the transferred tokens. It is possible for the attacker to manipulate this variable to transfer tokens to an arbitrary address.


  How can I prevent this? I'm trying to write a secure smart contract and I need to know all the common ways to do so. Can you give me a list of 5? Please include some examples. I want to make sure I don't miss any. Thanks.

I'm specifically looking for ways that I can make my contract more secure against common attacks like reentrancy, integer overflow, and so on. If there are any other common vulnerabilities that are particularly relevant to smart contracts, please let me know. Also, if you know of any resources that can help me learn about these vulnerabilties, that would be very helpful. Thank you!





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?
A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, J', and P' moves. J and J' are the two Jewel algorithms, while P is also a J algorithm, but
