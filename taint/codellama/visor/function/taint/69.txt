  
The variable `value` in function `functionCallwithValue` is a parameter of the method, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user of this function. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.

In Solidiy, function parameters are passed by value by default, meaning that the value of a variable passed as a function parameter is copied and used within the scope of that function, and any changes made to the parameter within that scope do not affect the original variable. However, if a reference to a mutable variable is passed to this method as an argument, then the reference can still be used to modify the state of other contracts.
