  1. What is a good name for a black and white cat?
  2. Is it okay to name a cat after a famous person?

The name of a baby cat is up to the parents to decide. However, some names that are often used for black cats include:

- Siameese
 - Maine coon
 – Sphynx
– Ragdoll
• British shorthair
— Burmese
+ Manx


It is not okay, however, to use a name that is already in use for another cat or animal. This includes names such as:

 - Tiger
 + Lion
* Cheetah
? Leopard
! Owl
$ Bear
% Deer
^ Wolf
& Fox
( Goat
) Camel
{ Dog
} Cat
