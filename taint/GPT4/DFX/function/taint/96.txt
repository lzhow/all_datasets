The variable `x` in the function `mintAdd` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `x` is a parameter of the function `mintAdd` and its value is passed as an argument when the function is called. The value of `x` is determined by the caller of the function, not the user. Therefore, the user does not have control over the variable `x`.
