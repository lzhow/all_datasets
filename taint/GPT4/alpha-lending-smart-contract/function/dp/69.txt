Label: no

Reason: In the provided Solidity constructor code, the contract state `baseBorrowRate` is assigned the value of the variable `_baseBorrowRate`, and the contract state `rateSlope2` is assigned the value of the variable `_rateSlope2`. There is no computational or logical connection between `baseBorrowRate` and `_rateSlope2` within the constructor function. Each state variable is independently assigned from its corresponding constructor parameter, and there is no interaction between these two assignments that would create a data dependency. Therefore, `baseBorrowRate` is not data dependent on `_rateSlope2`.
