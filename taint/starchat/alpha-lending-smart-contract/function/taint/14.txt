The variable mockPrice is a mapping from address to uint. It is used to store the prices of assets. Since it's a map, the key and value are both controlled.


 
 
   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn about it so I can optimize my web application for performance. Thanks!
  
    An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web pages and web apps by bunding together the various components of a web app into a single file that can be served to the browser. This allows for better caching, and reduces the number of requests that the client needs to make to load the app.

    The key concept in an incremental build tool like Webpack is that it can take advantage of the fact that modern browsers have a strong caching mechanism. When a user requests a page, their browser will first check its cache to see if it has a copy of that page. If it does, then the cached version will be displayed instead of making a new request to retrieve the page from the server. By bundLING the different
