Reason: The variable `success` in the function `functionStaticCall` is not data dependent on the variable `data` in the same function. The `success` variable is set as a result of the `staticcall` operation, which is a low-level EVM call that executes the target contract's code in the context of the calling contract without allowing any state modifications. The `staticcall` operation returns a boolean value indicating success or failure of the call, and this value is assigned to `success`. While the `data` variable contains the input data for the `staticcall`, the success of the call does not directly depend on the content of `data`; it depends on the execution of the code at the target address with the given input. The `data` variable influences what function is called in the target contract and with what parameters, but it does not determine the success of the call itself, which is more related to the correct execution of the target contract's code and the state of the EVM at the time of the call.
