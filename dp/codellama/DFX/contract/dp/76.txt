In the `viewTargetswap` function, the `_obals ` variable is defined as a new array of int 168 with the same length as the array `curves. assets`. The `for` loop in this function iterates over the length of the assets array and assigns the value of `Assililatros. viewNumereBalances` to the corresponding index of `_bals`.
However, in `GetOrigin SwappData`, the`_bALS` variable also uses the for loop to iterate over `Curves` assets and uses `assililaros. intakeRAWAndgetBalanc`e to assign the balance of each asset to its corresponding array index.
Therefore, `_ObalS ` is dependent on `_Bal` because they both use the loop over assets to get the balances of all assets.
