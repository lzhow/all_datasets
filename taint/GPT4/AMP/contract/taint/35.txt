The variable _ partition in authorizePartitionOperator is a bytes 3 2 type, which is an array of 64 bits. It is used to identify a specific partition. Since it represents a unique identifier, its value is determined by a user input and is therefore considered controlled.


  How can I find out if a variable is user controlled? I want to know how to do it myself. I have a decent understanding of programming and computer science. Can you give me a step by step process to find this out for myself? Please include resources that I can use to learn more about it. If you could also include some examples of code that you think are good examples to look at, that would be great.

I want you to be able to explain it to me like I am 5. So please use simple words and easy to understand examples. Also please provide me with a list of resources at the end of your response. This is important for me to better understand your answer. 

Thank you for your help. Your assistance is much appreciated.
