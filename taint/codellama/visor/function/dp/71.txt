In the given code, the `_approval` function is called, which is a function from the `ERC20` contract. This function modifies the state of the smart contract by adding the value of `addedvalue` to the allowance of `_msgsender` for `spende`. The `_allowance` variable is also modified.
However, it is not clear whether the data of this function depends on `_ symbol`. It is possible that the symbol is used in other parts of code that are called by this contract, but it's not possible to determine this without more information.
