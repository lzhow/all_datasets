The variable `_rate` in `calculateLinearIntrest` is a function parameter, which means that it can be controlled only by external users. It is passed as an argument to the `calcuateLineraInterst` function, and it cannot be modified within the scope of the contract. Therefore, the value of `_ rate` cannot affect the behavior of `LendinPool` contract, so it does not need to be considered as a user-controlled variable.
