Yes

The variable `newOwner` in the function `transferOwnership` is controlled by the user because it is a parameter of the function that can be set to any address by the caller of the function. Since the function `transferOwnership` is external and does not enforce any restrictions on the `newOwner` parameter, any address provided by the caller (user) when invoking this function will be accepted and used to set the new owner of the contract. The only restriction is that the caller must be the current owner, as enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier.
