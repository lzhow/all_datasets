  
No, the ` balanceof` contract is not dependent on ` success` variable in `_ safeTransfers` function.

The ` _ safe Transfer` is a private function that is called in ` mint` and ` burn` functions. It transfers tokens from the smart contract to the recipient address. If the transfer is successful, it emits a ` Transfer ` event. However, if the token transfer fails, an exception is thrown and the transaction is reverted, which means that the balance of the tokens in this contract will not be updated. Therefore, ` balances` are independent of ` successful` because the value of balance is determined by the current state of tokens, not by whether the previous transfer was successful or not.
