  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `authorizeOpeartor` function, the `_authorisedOperator` mapping is updated with the value `true` for the key `_operater`. This means that the state of the contract is now dependent on `_operation`.
Similarly, in `revokedOpreator` the same mapping `_authroizedOprator is update with value false for key _operation.
Therefore, `_operaotr` is data-dependent on both functions.
