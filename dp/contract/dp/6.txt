In the `Comtroller` contract, the variables `isComprtroll` and `enterMarkts` are declared as public constants. This means that they can be accessed from outside the contract and their values cannot be changed.
However, other variables such as `mintAllow` ` mintverify`, ` redemAllow`, and` reedemverify`are declared without the`public` keyword.This means these variables are private and can only be modified within the scope of the Comtrol contract.
