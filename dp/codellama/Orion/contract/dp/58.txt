  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `SaferMath` library, the functions `add`, `sub`, and `mul` are implemented using the same pattern: they first perform the arithmetic operation, and if the result is not within the expected range, it throws an error.
On the other hand, `div` and`mod` use a different pattern. They first check if `b` is zero, which would cause a division-by-zero error, or if`b `is greater than`a`, which could cause an overflow error in `mod`.
If neither of these conditions is met, then the division or modulus operation is performed. This means that the variables `c` in`add`and`mul`, as well as the`c `in`div`, are dependent on` a`in the sense that they cannot be computed independently of` b`. However, this dependency is only present in certain cases, depending on whether` c`is within range or not. Therefore, we say that` ` is data-dependent on ` a ` in this case.
