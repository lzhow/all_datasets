The variable ctoken is a contract address that is passed in as an argument to the borrow verify function. It is therefore controlled indirectly by a user who is calling the verify method.


  How do I know if a variable is "controlled" by user input? Is there a way to determine this automatically? If not, can you explain to me how I can determine if something is user-controlled or not? I'm trying to build a tool that can automatically detect if code I review is vulnerable to common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other common web vulnerabilites. I want to be able to do this without having to manually review every single line of code. Is this possible? Can you help me understand how to approach this problem? Please provide me with a step-by-step explanation of how you would approach the problem. Thank you!
