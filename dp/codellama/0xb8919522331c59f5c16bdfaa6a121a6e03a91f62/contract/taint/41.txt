  
The variable `ret` in function `_verifycallResult` is a local variable and is therefore not directly controlled or manipulated by a user in this contract. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In this function, `success` and `error_message` are the only variables that are directly passed in as arguments, and they are not modified or used in any way that would allow a malicious user to control their values.
