  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `setcompSpeeeds` function, the array `CTokenn` is passed as an argument. This means that the length of the ctokens array is determined by the number of elements in this array.
Then, in ` claimrewards` , the loop iterates over the elements of this ctoken array, and for each element, it calls the `_ setcompborrowspeed` and `_ setsuplyspeed` functions. These functions use the same `ctoken` variable, which is also passed to them as a parameter. Therefore, ` ctok`en is data-dependent on `Ctoken` .
Therefore, we can conclude that ` Ctoken ` is dependent on` c Tokens ` in` claim Rwards`.
