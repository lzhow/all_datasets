Explanation: The variable `_nGLiq` in the function `calculateTrade` is data dependent on the variable `_diff` in the function `enforceSwapInvariant`. This is because the value of `_nGLiq` is updated in the `if` statement based on the condition `outputAmt_ / 1e13 == prevAmount / 1e13`, which depends on the value of `_diff` in the `enforceSwapInvariant` function.
