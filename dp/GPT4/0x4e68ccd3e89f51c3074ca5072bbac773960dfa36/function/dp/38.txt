Yes

The variable `observationCardinality` in the function `swap` is data dependent on the variable `cache`. This is because `observationCardinality` is assigned a value that is potentially influenced by the `cache.blockTimestamp` through the `observations.write` function call. The `cache` structure holds the `blockTimestamp` which is used as an argument in the `observations.write` function, and the result of this function includes the `observationCardinality`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `observationCardinality` and `cache` due to the flow of data from `cache` to `observationCardinality` through the function call and its arguments.
