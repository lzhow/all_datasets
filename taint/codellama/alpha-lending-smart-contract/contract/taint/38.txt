  
No, the `_underylingAsset ` variable in function contructor is NOT controlled  by user because it's a parameter of the constructor and it can't be changed after the contract is deployed.

The constructor function in Solidiy is used to initialize the state of a contract when it gets deployed on the blockchain. It is called only once, when the contrat is created, and its purpose is to set the initial state and values of variables.  The parameters of constructor are passed when creating the instance of contract. They are not user-controlled and can not be modified after deployment.
