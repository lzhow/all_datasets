   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn about the topic for a job interview. Thanks!
  
    An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the users. This makes it easier for the browser to load the application and makes the initial load time faster.

    The tool works by analyzing the dependencies between the files in your application, and only rebuilding parts of the bundle that have changed since the last build. It also performs other optimizations to reduce the size of your bundle and make it load faster, such as minifying and tree-shaking code.

Webpack is probably the most popular example of an incremental bundle tool, but there are others like Rollup and Parcel that are used in other contexts as well. They all work by recursively walking through your project directory and generating a graph of
