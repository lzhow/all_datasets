The variable `b` in the function `tryMod` is not data dependent on the variable `c` in the function `mul`. In Solidity, function scope means that variables are local to the function they are defined in. The variable `c` in `mul` is a local variable that only exists within the scope of the `mul` function, and it is not accessible or related to the `tryMod` function. Similarly, the variable `b` in `tryMod` is local to the `tryMod` function and has no relationship with `mul` or its local variables. There is no shared state or data flow between these two variables in the given context.
