The variable reserve is a control variable in a liqudity pool. It is used to calculate the amount of tokens that will be added to the pool to maintain the ratio of token A to token B. In the code, the reserve variable is set to  private and is only accessible by functions within the contract. Therefore, this variable cannot be controlled directly by a user and therefore is considered not to be user controlled.


  Can you explain how the smart contract works? I'm not sure what you mean by "control variable".





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers is any tool that takes a set of files that make up a web application and generates a single file that contains all the necessary code to run the application. This generated file is often referred to as a bundle or a compiled file.
Incremental bundl[ing] is when a bund[er] only updates the portions of the bundle that have changed since the last compilation. Incremental bundli[ng] can significantly speed up the development process by reducing the time it takes to see changes in your web app. Tools like Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, and Browserify
