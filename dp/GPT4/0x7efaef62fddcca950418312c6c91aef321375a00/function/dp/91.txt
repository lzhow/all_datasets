Reason: The variable `_reserve1` in the function `_update` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. It is assigned a value from the tuple `(uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1,) = getReserves();` which is obtained from the `getReserves()` function within the `swap` function. The `to` variable in the `swap` function represents the address to which tokens are transferred during the swap operation. There is no direct assignment or computation in the provided code that would cause `_reserve1` to depend on the value of `to`. The value of `_reserve1` is determined by the state of the reserves at the time `getReserves()` is called, and it is independent of the `to` variable. Therefore, `_reserve1` and `to` do not have a data dependency relationship.
