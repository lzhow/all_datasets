  
The label is 'No'.

In the ` functionfunctionCallwithValue` function, the` data` variable is passed as an argument to the target contract's `call` method. This means that the value of ` data ` is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in `  functionstaticCall`, the  `target` contract is called using the staticcall method, which does not pass any arguments. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the variables ` target` and ` error Message` .
Therefore, we can conclude that there are no dependencies between `errorMessage`  and  the data in  `` functioncallwithvalue``.
