Yes, the variable `id` in the function `buyERC1155` is data dependent on the variable `ids` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `id` is used as the index to access elements in the `ids` array. The loop iterates over the `ids` array, and in each iteration, the value of `id` is updated to the current index. Therefore, the value of `id` depends on the values in the `ids` array.
