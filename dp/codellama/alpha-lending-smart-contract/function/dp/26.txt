  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `fromblock` variable is assigned a value based on whether the `_toblock ` variable value is greater than the start block or not. If the value of `_ toblock is less than or equal to the` startblock`, the fromblock variable will be assigned the same value as the _startblock.
Then, in line 10, `nextweekblock =` is calculated based `on the nextweekfirstblock function` and the current value `of the week variable`.
Finally, on line12,`totalamount`is calculated by adding the difference between ` next week block`and ` from block`, multiplied by the tokens per block value for the corresponding week, to ` totalamount`.  The valueof `to block `is also updated to be the lesser of ` to block and next block`. The loop continues until `totamount `reaches the total amount of tokens that have been released.  In the second function , the logic is similar, but the variables are named differently. Therefore, it is clear that the values of the two functions are dependent on each other.
