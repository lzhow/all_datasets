The variable excessUtilisationRateRation is a local variable in calculateIntersetRate function. It is used to calculate the slope of the interest rate function and is calculated based on the difference between the utilisation rate and the optimal utiliation rate.

As such, the value of excessUtlisationRatios is determined by user input and cannot be controlled directly by users.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at maths





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.  How about a "static bundlers" like Webpack or Rollup? Why might you choose one over the other?  Expound on "tree-shaking" and how it works in relation to bundling.   What other tools might be useful in bundLING web apps? Please provide a list and a brief explanation of each. Provide code examples if possible. Thank you. Your response should be formatted in MarkDown and have a max word count of 500 words. If you need more space you can add additional sections. Good luck!
