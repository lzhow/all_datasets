   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to make my own programs.   There are many resources available to help you learn Python. Here are some of them:

1. Codecademy: This is an interactive website that offers a variety of courses on Python programming. It has a very easy-to-use interface and allows you to practice writing code right in your browser.

2. FreeCodeCamp: Similar to Codeacademy, FreeCodecamp offers courses and tutorials on a wide range of programming languages, including Python, HTML, and CSS. They have a more structured approach and focus on practical applications, rather than theory. 

3. Udemy: Udemy offers many courses in Python development, from beginner to advanced levels. These courses are taught by experienced instructors and are often very comprehensive.

These are just a few of the many options available. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's best to choose one that fits your learning style and goals. Good luck!
