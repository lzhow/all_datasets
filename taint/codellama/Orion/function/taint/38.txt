  
The variable 'amount spend base units' in do swap through Orin Pool is labeled as 'Yes' because it comes from the input of the swap data. This means that the value of this variable is determined by user input.

In the code, the `do swapTrohughOrinPool` function takes in a `SwappedData` object as an argument, which contains the amount spend and amount receive. These values are then used to calculate the base unit amounts. Therefore, these values can be controlled directly by a user and are not determined automatically by other factors.
