Reason: The contract state `partitionStrategies` is an array that keeps track of the different partition strategies used within the contract. It is only modified in the `setPartitionStrategy` function where new partition strategies are added to the array.

On the other hand, the variable `_value` in the function `_addTokenToPartition` represents the amount of tokens to be added to a particular partition for a specific address. This function updates the balances of tokens within different partitions but does not interact with the `partitionStrategies` array or its contents.

Since there is no code path where `_value` would affect the contents of `partitionStrategies`, or vice versa, there is no data dependency relationship between `partitionStrategies` and `_value` in the function `_addTokenToPartition`.
