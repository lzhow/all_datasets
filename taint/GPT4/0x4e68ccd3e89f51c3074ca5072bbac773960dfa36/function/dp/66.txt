Reason: The variable `tickCurrent` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is an input parameter that is used to determine the fee growth below or above a certain tick. It is independent of the state of the contract and is not modified within the function.

The variable `flipped` in the function `update` is a local variable that is calculated based on the state change of the liquidity (whether it has flipped from 0 to non-0 or vice versa). It is determined by the `liquidityGrossBefore` and `liquidityGrossAfter` variables, which are related to the `liquidityDelta` and the current state of `info.liquidityGross`.

Since `tickCurrent` is an input parameter that does not depend on the contract state and `flipped` is a local variable that depends on the contract state and is unrelated to `tickCurrent`, there is no data dependency relationship between `tickCurrent` and `flipped`.
