  
No, the variables `_bal` and `_withdrawn` are dependent on `_amount` which is a parameter of the `depost` function.

The `withDraw` method is called within the deposited method, and the `_witdraw` variable is calculated based on `bal. sub(_bal)` and `totalShares`.
Therefore, `_ pool` is dependent only on itself and not on any other variable.
