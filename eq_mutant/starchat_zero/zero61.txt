No, the mutated code still has the exact same behaviour and output as the original code, which is why they aren't semantic equal in the traditional sense. The only changes made to the code are the swapped values of i and j in lines 9 and 23. This wouldn't impact the functionality of the program, but may affect its performance if it depends on the order in which the elements are sorted.
