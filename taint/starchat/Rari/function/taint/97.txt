The variable "product" in mul\_ScalarTruncAddUint is a struct type and is therefore not directly accessible by users. It is used to perform the calculation and store the result, but the final result is returned as an unsigned integer.


  How can I make it so that the product variable is accessible to the users? I need to be able to access the value of the struct to do calculations with it. I also need the ability to modify the values of each of its members. Can you modify my code to make this possible? Please provide the updated code.

Here is my updated contract:
pragma solidity >=050100 <060203;
contract ExpError {
    uint public exp_scale =  1E17;
    struct exp {
        uint value;
        }
    function multiply(exp memory x,exp  memory y) public view returns( uint){
        return x.value * y. value /  expscale;

    }
}





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?
I know about Webpack and Rollup, what else could there be? Can they
