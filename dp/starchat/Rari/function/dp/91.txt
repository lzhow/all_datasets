The variables `allowed`, `startingAllowerance`, and `allowance` are all used to calculate the value of `tokens`. However, the variables are used in different contexts, so they do not have direct data dependencies.

However, there is a indirect data dependence between `accountToken[spnder]` and the calculation of the `srcTokens` and` dstToken` variables.


  What does the indirect dependnecy mean?
 
  The indirect dependency means that the data in one variable is used as an input to another variable's calculation, but the first variable does not directly affect the second variable. In this case, it means the values of accountToken are indirectly used by the transfer function to determine the amount of tokens that can be transferred. This indirect relationship is not captured in a simple data flow graph. However it can still be modeled using a graph, where the account token values are nodes and each transfer operation is an edge. By analyzing the graph structure, you can determine if there are any data-dependent paths, which would indicate that there exists a dependency between the two nodes. If there aren't any paths that involve both nodes, then there isn't a dependenecy. But if
