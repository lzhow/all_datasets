The variable `data` in the function `decodeU64` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `decodeU256` because the latter calls the former as part of its decoding process. Specifically, `decodeU256` calls `decodeU128` twice, which in turn calls `decodeU64` twice. The `data` variable, which represents the state of the decoding process (including the raw bytes to be decoded and the current offset), is passed through these function calls. Changes to the `data.offset` within `decodeU64` will affect subsequent reads from `data.raw`, which means that the decoding process in `decodeU256` is directly dependent on the manipulation of `data` within `decodeU64`.
