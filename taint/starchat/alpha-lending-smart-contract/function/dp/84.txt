The function claimCurentAlphaRewards has a loop that iterates over all the users and all tokens. For each user and token, it calculates the alpha reward and updates the total alpha token reward.

In the calculateRundUpBorroShareAmout function, the code calculates a value that is used to calculate the borrow share amount. This value is based on two factors: the amount of the token and the current total borrow amount in all pools. If either of these two values is  zero, then the value of this function is simply the input amount, since there is no way to borrow any amount from a pool with no borrows.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  Data dependency is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value in a program depends on another variable. In the context of smart contracts, data dependencies refer to how variables in one contract or function depend on variables from another contract. Data dependencies can be used by program analyzers to optimize the performance of a contract by reducing the number of reads and writes to the blockchain state. By analyzing the data dependences of
