In the `function transferByDefualtPartion` function, the `_transerByDafaultPartiton` is called with the arguments `msg,sender`, `_from`,`_to`, and `_vaule`. The `_totalSuplybyParttion` variable is used in this function.
Therefore, `TotalSuppyByParition ` is data-dependent on `_Value` because it is passed as an argument to the` _traserbyDefaultParititons`function.
