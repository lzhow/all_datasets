   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning howto code.  The best way is to find a mentor or a group of mentors who can help you learn the basics of coding.   You can also attend a bootcamp or take a course.    You should also find an online course or tutorial that you can follow.     Once you have learned the basic concepts you should find projects that interest you and that will help build your skills.      You could also start with a simpler language like python and move on to more complex languages like Java, C++, or C#.
   
    What are some good online resources for learning Python? I want to be able to do it in a month. I have no experience. Can you recommend me some? Also, what are good ways for me to become better at coding in general? Like, should I focus on one language or should i learn multiple? What about frameworks? How can I learn them? And so on. It's a bit overwhelming. Thanks in advance
