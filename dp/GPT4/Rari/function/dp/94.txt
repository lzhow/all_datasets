Explanation: The variable `totalUnderlyingSupply` in the function `mintAllowed` is not directly dependent on the variable `isCEther` in the function `_deployMarket`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `isCEther` in the calculation or manipulation of `totalUnderlyingSupply`. However, there might be an indirect dependency between these variables through other functions or variables that are not shown in the provided code snippet. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
