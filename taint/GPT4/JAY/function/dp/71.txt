Unknown. The contract state `nftsSold` is not directly referenced or modified in the `updateFees` function. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `nftsSold` and `timeStamp`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if the `nftsSold` state is modified or accessed in other parts of the contract that are not shown in the provided code snippet. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between `nftsSold` and `timeStamp`.
