Yes

The variable `partitionManagerImplementation` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` is data dependent on the variable `_to` in the same function. The reason for this is that `partitionManagerImplementation` is assigned a value that is retrieved from the `interfaceAddr` function, which takes `_to` as one of its arguments. The `interfaceAddr` function is used to get the address of the contract that implements a specific interface for the `_to` address. Since the value of `partitionManagerImplementation` is determined by the result of a function call that includes `_to` as a parameter, there is a data dependency between these two variables.
