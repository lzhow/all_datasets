The variable `feeGrowthAbove0X128` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is data dependent on the variable `upper` in the same function. The reason for this is that `feeGrowthAbove0X128` is assigned a value based on a conditional statement that checks the `tickCurrent` against `tickUpper`. The `upper` variable is a reference to the `Tick.Info` struct instance for the `tickUpper`. The value of `feeGrowthAbove0X128` is determined by whether `tickCurrent` is less than `tickUpper`, and in each branch of the conditional, it uses the `feeGrowthOutside0X128` property of the `upper` struct instance to calculate its value. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `feeGrowthAbove0X128` and `upper` because the value of `feeGrowthAbove0X128` is derived from the properties of `upper`.
