Explanation: The variable `nBals_` in the function `getOriginSwapData` is data dependent on the variable `nBals_` in the function `viewOriginSwapData`. This is because in both functions, the value of `nBals_[i]` is assigned based on the condition `if (i != _inputIx)`. If the condition is true, then `nBals_[i]` is assigned the value of `oBals_[i]`, which is the same in both functions. Therefore, the value of `nBals_` in `getOriginSwapData` depends on the value of `nBals_` in `viewOriginSwapData`.
