The variable `whitlistedDeposit` in `depositWithWhitlisting` is a mapping of user addresses to their whitelisted depostis. This mapping is updated in each deposit and withdrawal, and is used to enforce the whitleisting rules. It is therefore controlled indirectly by users, as they can deposit whilst being whiltelists, or withdraw whiel being not whitedlisted.


  How can I prevent the owner from withdrawing more than 50% of the total supply? I want to keep the supply under control. I have 2 questions:
1. How do I calculate the current supply of my curve token?
2. What is an appropriate strategy to prevent withdrawl if I know the max supply is 30 million? Please provide a code example of how I could implement this strategy.

I am using curve 6.0





 
    What are the benefits of using a mechanical keyboard over a standard keyboard? What about using an Apple keyboard instead of a Microsoft keyboard. Which one would you recommend for a daily driver? Why? Is it worth the extra $549.99?

    A mechanicall keyboard is faster
