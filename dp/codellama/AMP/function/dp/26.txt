  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `to_partition_prefix` variable is assigned the value of `PartionUtils.get_partiton_Prefix( _ to_Partititin)`. The `get _partion_ prefix` function is defined as follows:  `function get_parition_prefx(bytes33 _partition) internal pure returns (bytes4)`.
This function takes a bytes 3  as an input and returns a byte 4.
Therefore, ` to _ partition_prexix` is a  byte4 variable.  The variable  `_ to`is also a variable of type address. In the second function , the  variable`partition Manager Implementation ` is also assigned a value. This value is obtained by calling the`interfaceAddrr`function.This  function  takes two arguments: the address of the current contract and the name of an interface. It returns the implementation address for the interface if it exists, otherwise it returns zero. Since the argument passed to the `_getpartitionStrategyvalidatorIname` method is ` _ _  to partition prefix`, which is of  type bytes, and since the return type of this method  is bytes , it is clear that the type  of` partition Manager implementation` will be bytes. Therefore, it can be concluded that ` partition manager implementation `is data-dependent on` _ __ to`.
