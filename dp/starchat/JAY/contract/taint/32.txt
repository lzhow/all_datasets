yes, the `msg` variable is a global variable that is accessible to all functions in a contract. It contains information about the current transaction, such as the sender and recipient of the transaction. In the case of `sell`, the value of msg is passed to the `_burn` function, which is part of OpenZeppelin's `ERC223` standard. This function is used to destroy tokens, and in this case, `value` is set to `JAXtoEth( value )`.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiy





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, or L moves. JPLL algorithms are generally considered easy to learn and understand, making them ideal for beginners.
The J move is often considered the most difficult of these moves to master, as it involves a lot of twisting and turning. However, once mastered, this move can be a very powerful tool in solving a cube. PPLL and LPLL are also considered easier than J.



  The J Move is considered
