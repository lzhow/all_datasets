yes

In the provided Solidity function `transferOwnership`, the contract state `owner` is directly assigned the value of the variable `newOwner`. This means that the state of `owner` is dependent on the value passed to `newOwner` when the function is called. The assignment `owner = newOwner;` establishes a data dependency relationship between the two, as the state of `owner` will change based on the input provided to `newOwner`.
