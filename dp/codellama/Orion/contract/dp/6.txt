  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `_doAddLiuquidty` function, the ` amountBD` variable is calculated using the formula: `OrignMultiPollLibrary .quote(AmountAD, ReserveA , ReserveB)`. The `AmountA` and `ReserveB ` variables are both passed as arguments to the` _AddLiquiudty `function, so ` AmountBd` is data-dependent on `AmoutAD`.
