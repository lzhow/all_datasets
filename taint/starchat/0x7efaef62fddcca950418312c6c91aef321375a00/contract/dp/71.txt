   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used a lot of other coding languages, and I'm not really sure what all the hype is about. Could you give me some advice? I know it's important to have fun and enjoy the process, so I'd love it if you could provide me with projects that test my skills and keep me motivated. If that's too hard, just give some good websites or apps that have simple games or programs that I can use to keep myself motived. Thanks!
