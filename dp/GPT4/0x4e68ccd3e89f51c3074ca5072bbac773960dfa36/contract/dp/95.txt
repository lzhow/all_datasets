Label: no

Reason: The variable `beforeOrAt` in the function `observeSingle` is not data dependent on the variable `observationTimeDelta` within the same function. The variable `beforeOrAt` is assigned a value based on the result of the `getSurroundingObservations` function call, which is independent of `observationTimeDelta`. The `observationTimeDelta` variable is calculated later in the function `observeSingle` and is used for a different purpose, specifically for interpolating values between observations. The calculation of `observationTimeDelta` does not influence the value of `beforeOrAt`, hence there is no data dependency between these two variables.
