The variable "account" in function "balanceOf" is a user-controlled input. It is used to retrieve the balance of the specified account. As such, the input must be sanitized and validated to ensure that it does not point to an unexpected or invalid account address.


  Can you give me an example of how to write a test for this contract? I want to make sure that the contract behaves as expected when the account variable is set to a specific value. I also want you to include a few edge cases that you think are important to test. For example, what happens if you set the value to  address 2^22? What happens when you try to set it to address "0x123"?
 
  Yes, here is an edge case test that can be added to your contract:

pragma solidity ^076.0;
import "hardhat/console. sol";
contract MyContract {
    address public account;
    function setAccount( address _account) external {
        account =_account;
        console.log("Account set!");
    }
}
In this test, we first import the console library from Hardhat. This library provides us with helpful functions for logging and
