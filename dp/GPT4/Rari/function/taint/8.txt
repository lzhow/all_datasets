Reason: The variable `err` in the function `repayBorrow` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the return value of the `repayBorrowInternal` function. The value of `err` is determined by the internal logic of the `repayBorrowInternal` function and is not influenced by any user input.
