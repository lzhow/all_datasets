  
No, the variables `_address` and `erc235` are independent.

The variable  `_tokensAddress ` is a parameter of the ` buy ER122` function, which is called from the` buy J1`function. This means that the value of `_ tokenAddress  `is determined by the caller of ` buyerc2 `, and it is not dependent on any other variable in ` Buy J`.
On the other hand, ` ids` is an internal variable of` BuyerC` that is used to iterate over the elements of an array. It is set to the length of another array,` erC 7 31 TokenAddress`, which means it can take on different values depending on how many elements are in that array and the order in which they appear. However, it does not depend on anything else in` buyrC`. Therefore, `_ tokensAddress and` ids are unrelated.
