  
No, the state variable isHashed_ is not dependent on swap description.

The reason is that the isHasUed variable does not appear in any of the expressions that depend on SwapsDescription in this function. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the value of isHased_ changes based on changes to SwapesDescription or not.
