The variable `amountsOut` in the function `getAmountsOut` is data dependent on the variable `amountInWithFee` in the function `getAmountOut`. The reason for this is that `amountsOut` is calculated by calling `getAmountOut` for each pair in the `pairs` array, and within the `getAmountOut` function, `amountInWithFee` is calculated based on the input `amountIn`, which is an element of the `amountsOut` array from the previous iteration. The `amountInWithFee` variable directly influences the calculation of `amountOut`, which is then assigned to the next element of the `amountsOut` array, creating a data dependency between these variables.
