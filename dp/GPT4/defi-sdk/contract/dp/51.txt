Label: no

Reason: The variable `input` in the function `cancelAccountSignature` and the variable `input` in the function `validateProtocolFeeSignature` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. They are not dependent on each other because each function invocation receives its own arguments, and the state of one `input` parameter does not affect the other. Solidity function parameters are passed by value (for value types) or by reference (for reference types like arrays and structs), but in either case, the scope of the parameters is local to the function itself. Since these two functions do not share state and there is no interaction between them that would cause the `input` in one function to depend on the `input` in the other, they are not data dependent.
