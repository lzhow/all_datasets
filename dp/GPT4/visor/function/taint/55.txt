The variable _decimal is a constant in this contract and is set to 18. It is defined in line 21 as `uint8 private constant _DECIMALS = 8;`. This means that the value of _deciamls is fixed and cannot be changed by any user input. Therefore, the answer is no, `_decilams` is NOT controlled  by user in function `False`.
