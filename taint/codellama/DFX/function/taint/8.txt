  
No, the `_ quoteWeight ` variable in view Proporional Deposite is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is defined in line 11 of the code.

The `_baseweight` variable is also not user-controlled because its value is calculated from the `weighs` array, which is a public variable that can be accessed by anyone. Therefore, both `_ baseweight ` and `_ quotewight ` are not under the control of users.
