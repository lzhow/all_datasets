The variable `b` in the function `sub` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `b` is an input parameter of the function `sub`, which means its value is provided by the caller of the function. Since the function is an internal function, it can only be called within the contract itself. Therefore, the value of `b` is determined by the contract and not controlled by the user.
