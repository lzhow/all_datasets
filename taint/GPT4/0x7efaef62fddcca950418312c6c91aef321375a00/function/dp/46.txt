Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `mint`, the contract state `reserve1` is data dependent on the variable `balance1`. This is because `balance1` is used to calculate `amount1` by subtracting `_reserve1` from `balance1`. Later in the code, `amount1` is used in the calculation of `liquidity`, which is then used in the `_mint` function call that affects the contract's state. Additionally, if the `feeOn` is true, `reserve1` is used in the calculation of `kLast`, which is a state variable that depends on the value of `reserve1`. Since `reserve1` is an alias for `_reserve1` (as seen in the destructuring assignment from `getReserves()`), and `_reserve1` is used in the calculations involving `balance1`, there is a data dependency relationship between `reserve1` and `balance1`.
