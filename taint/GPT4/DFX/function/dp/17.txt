Explanation: The variable `_length` is data dependent on the variable `curve` in the function `viewProportionalWithdraw`. This is because the value of `_length` is assigned the length of `curve.assets`, which is a property of the `curve` variable. Therefore, any changes to the `curve` variable will affect the value of `_length`.
