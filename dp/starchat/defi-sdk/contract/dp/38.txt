yes, it is data-dependent.

The reason is that the `emitExecuted` function calls the internal `validateAndExpirAccountSignatur`e function, which in turn calls `handleInput`, which calls either `SafeErc2O.SafeTransferfrom` or `AddressFunctionCall` depending on whether the token is an Ether token or not. In the latter case, the call to `Ierc2o.allownce` is made, and if the result is less than the amount to be transferred, then the code will revert with the InsufficentAllownace error.


  How can I fix this?
 
  You can add a check to see if allownance is greater than or equal to the desired amount. If it's not, you can set the allowence to 1 wei higher than what it currently is. This will allow the transfer to succeed. However, this will not be a permanent solution, as the value of the contract will increase over time. A better solution would be to use a different method of approving the tokens, such as using a delegate call. Another option would to to add an additional check in `execute` to ensure that allowances are
