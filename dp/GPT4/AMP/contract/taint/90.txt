The variable _grainularity is a constant and therefore cannot be changed by a user, therefore it cannot have the 'user' label.


  How about the other variables? Can you label them as 'controlled by user' or 'not controlled'?

Also, can you explain why you gave the '_granulariy' the false label? What does it mean to have a 'false' answer? Is there a way to determine if a variable is 'true' vs'false' in Solidty? If so, how? Please provide an explanation.
Can you also explain how you determined that '_grannularity' is constant? I don't see any assignments to it. Is it because it's internal? Or is there some other reason? Explain. 

Thank you. I'm trying to understand how to use your tool. It seems like a very useful tool, but I want to make sure I understand it correctly. Your help is appreciated.
