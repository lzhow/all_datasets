  
No, the `_ balances ` contract variable is not dependent on ` total ` in ` buy NFT `, because the ` _ balance ` variable does not change in any way in relation to the value of ` ` .

The ` `_ balance `  variable stores the balance of the user's account, and it is updated only when the buy function is called. However, in this function, ` er c7 2  ` and `erc 7 ` are used to calculate the total amount of tokens to be bought, but the amount is never stored in `_ _balance`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between `_` _`bal` and` total`.
