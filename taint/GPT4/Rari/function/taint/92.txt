Explanation: The variable `left` in the function `lessThanExp` is not controlled by the user. It is a parameter of the function and its value is passed by the caller of the function. The function itself does not modify the value of `left` and does not interact with any user input. Therefore, the variable `left` is not controlled by the user.
