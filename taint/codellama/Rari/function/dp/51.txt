  
The label is 'No'.

Explanation:
In the `_setborrowPause` function, the `borrowerGuaridanPauses` variable is set to the value of the input parameter `bool state`. The `require` statements in this function do not depend on any other variables.
On the other hand, in `_ become`function, `unitroler._ acceptImplemenation` is called, which sets the`change Status`variable to 1. However, this variable does not affect the behavior of `_ setBorrowePauesed` or any of its variables, so it is independent of ` state` and ` change Status`.
Therefore, we can conclude that `State`is not dependent on `Change Status.`
