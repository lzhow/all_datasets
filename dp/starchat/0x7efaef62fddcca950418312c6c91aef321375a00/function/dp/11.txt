The contract variable price1Last is not directly used in this function, but it is used to calculate the value of the reserve1 variable.

To determine if the price variable is data-dependent on balance, we need to determine whether the calculation of reserve0 and reserve 1 depends on price. This can be done by analyzing the code in detail and determining whether any of these variables are updated based on changes to the other. In this case, it can't be determined from the given code.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the `reserve` variable in `getReservse()` is dependent on `totalsupply`.
  
  The `reserves` variables in getReserve() are dependent of `liqudity` and `feeon`.
In the mint function the liqudiity is calculated as follow:
`liquidity = min( amount_0 * total_supply / reserve_1, amount  _1 *total_suply /reserve_2)`
where `amount_i` is balance of token i and reserves are the current reseves of tokens.  The mint fee is also dependent to reserse variables.
