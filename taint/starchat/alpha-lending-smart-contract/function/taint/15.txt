The variable vestingAlpah is a constant in this contract, and as such it cannot be changed by any user interacting with it. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.


  What about the other variables? Are they all controlled or not? Explain your reasoning.
 
  The other variable in that contract is `distributor`, which is also a contract. It is possible for the owner of the contract to change the address of `Distributor` to a new contract that has a different implementation. In this case, if `setDistributer` is called, then the new `distribute` function in `newDistribute` will be called instead of calling the old `distrubute` in `_distributer`. This could potentially allow the attacker to steal funds from the pool by calling `splitReward` with the `attackerContract` as the `_token` parameter. However, since the only function that can be used to call `mintAltoken`, `burnAltokens`, and `giveAlpha`, all require the caller to have the ALPHA token, this attack would not be possible.

In general, contracts that rely on the ability to modify their own state should be avoided, as this
