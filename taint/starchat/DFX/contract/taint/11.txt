The variable "curve" in function "proportionalWithDraw" is a state variable of the contract and is therefore controlled entirely by contract owner.


 
Please explain why





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization of web apps works under the hood. Thanks!



  An incremental bundlers like Webpack is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the users browser. This makes it much easier for the browser to load the application since it only has to download a small amount of data instead of having to make multiple requests for each individual file.

In addition to bunding the files together, an incremental bundle tool like webpack also performs other optimizations like minifying the code, tree shaking, and dead code elimination. These optimizations help to reduce the size of your application and make it load faster. 

Webpack also has a lot of plugins that allow you to add additional functionality to your build
