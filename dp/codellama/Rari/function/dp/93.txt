  
No, the variables `borowCap` and `newBrowCAP` are independent.

The variable borrowcap is defined in function `BORROWALLOWED` as a local variable, and it is not modified in this function. Therefore, it does not depend on any other variable in `function borrowALlowed`.
Similarly, `NewBROWCAPP` is a parameter of the `setMArketBorkrowcaps()` function, which is also a variable that is passed as an argument to the `_SETMAKRBROKROWcAPS()` method. It is therefore not dependent on `NumBrownCapps`.
