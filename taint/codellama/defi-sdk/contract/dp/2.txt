In the `approveandCall` function, the value of `amount` is set to the balance of the token at address `InputToken`. The `Base` contract is used to get the current balance.
`Base`.getbalance`(Inputtoken)`
This function is called in `Approvandcall` and `Callbytes`.
Therefore, `Amount` depends on ` InputToken`, which is a parameter of` Callbytes`, and therefore ` inputtoken`is data-dependent on` callercallData`.
