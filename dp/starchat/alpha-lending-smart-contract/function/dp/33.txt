   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am currently in high school, and I took AP Computer Science A in 2 years ago. Is it worth it to just keep using python, or should I switch to a different language? I heard about Java being good for beginners, should i switch? Or should python just stick around? Please help me make an informed decision. Thank you.

I also heard of people who say that Java is easier to use than python. What do you think of that? Is there a reason why some people say it is? Thankyou. 
   

  What are some good alternatives to Python?
What are the pros and cons of each?  Please provide a list of at least 5.
 
Please also provide some information on each of the languages you have recommended. For example, how popular is each language, what are its strengths, weaknesses, etc.?
 


Thank you
