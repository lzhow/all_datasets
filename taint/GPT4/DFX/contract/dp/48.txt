The variable `_nGLiq` in the function `viewOriginSwapData` is not data dependent on the variable `_length` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `_nGLiq` is calculated based on the values of `_length`, `nBals_`, and `oBals_` in the `viewOriginSwapData` function. However, the value of `_length` is not used in the calculation of `_nGLiq`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
