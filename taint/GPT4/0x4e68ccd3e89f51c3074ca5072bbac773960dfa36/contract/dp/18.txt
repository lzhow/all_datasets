Yes

The variable `aAdjusted` in the function `lte` is data dependent on the variable `time` in the function `observeSingle`. The reason for this is that `aAdjusted` is calculated based on the value of `a` and the condition that checks whether `a` is greater than `time`. The `time` variable is passed as an argument to the `lte` function from `observeSingle`, and its value influences the outcome of the condition and thus the value of `aAdjusted`. If `a` is not greater than `time`, `aAdjusted` is set to `a + 2**32`, which means the calculation of `aAdjusted` depends on the comparison with `time`.
