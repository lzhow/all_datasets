Label: no

Reason: The contract state `implementation` is not referenced or used anywhere in the function `distributeSupplierComp`. The function `distributeSupplierComp` only interacts with the `compSupplyState` mapping (specifically the `supplyState` local variable which is a reference to `compSupplyState[cToken]`), `compSupplierIndex`, and `compAccrued` to calculate and distribute rewards. There is no direct or indirect interaction with an `implementation` state variable within this function, nor is there any indication that `supplyState` would affect or be affected by an `implementation` variable. Therefore, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
