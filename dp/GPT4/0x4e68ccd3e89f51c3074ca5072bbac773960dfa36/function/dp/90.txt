Label: no

Reason: The variable `secondsInside` in the function `snapshotCumulativesInside` is calculated based on the `secondsOutsideLower` and `secondsOutsideUpper` variables, which are derived from the `ticks` mapping for the given `tickLower` and `tickUpper`. It represents the time inside the specified tick range.

On the other hand, the variable `_feeGrowthGlobal0X128` in the function `_updatePosition` is a state variable that represents the global fee growth in token0 terms. It is used to update the position's accumulated fees and does not directly affect the calculation of `secondsInside`.

There is no direct data dependency between `secondsInside` and `_feeGrowthGlobal0X128` as they are used in different contexts within the contract and are derived from different sources of data. `secondsInside` is related to the passage of time within a tick range, while `_feeGrowthGlobal0X128` is related to the accumulation of fees.
