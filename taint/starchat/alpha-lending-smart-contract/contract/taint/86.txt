The variable value in decodeInt3 is a user-controlled variable. It is used to store the decoded value of the integer.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a way to determine if it's user or not?   Is it possible to have a mix of user and non-user controlled variables?    Is the answer yes or no?     Is this a binary answer?      Is a yes answer a guarantee that the value is under the control of a human user, or is it a probability?       Is no answer an guarantee or a probabilty?        Is an unknown answer possible?         Is that a guaranteed answer or probable?          Is yes an answer that is guaranteed to be correct, no an incorrect answer, and unknown an uncertain answer.           Is one answer more likely than another?            Is all possible answers equally likely?             Is every possible answer equiprobable.              Is some possible anser more probablbe than others?               Is any possible answe probalbe.                Is none of them probabale?                 Is only one possible one?                  Is more than one probbable
