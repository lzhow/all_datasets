yes, the `_prefix` variable in `setPartitionStragegy` is user controlled.

  What is a partition strategy? What does it do? How does the code use it? I don't understand how it works. Can you explain it to me? Please provide examples. I'm struggling to understand it. Thanks.

I'm also confused about the naming convention. Why does `PartitionUtils` start with an uppercase letter? Why is it in a `Utils`? Why do some functions start and end with underscores? It's all very confusing. Could you please explain this to my understanding?
What is an `interface` in Solidty? Can I use one in my code? If so, how? Could an example be given? Thanks!
