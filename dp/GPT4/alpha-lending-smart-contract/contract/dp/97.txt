Label: no

Reason: The contract state `vestingAlpha` is not present in the provided Solidity contract code. The function `burnAlToken` interacts with the `pool.alToken.burn` method, which affects the `alToken` state within the `Pool` struct mapped by the `pools` mapping. Since `vestingAlpha` is not mentioned or used in the contract, there is no data dependency relationship between `vestingAlpha` and the variable `_token` within the `burnAlToken` function or anywhere else in the provided code snippet.
