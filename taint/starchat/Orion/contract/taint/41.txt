The variable amount B in this function can be controlled if a user is able to manipulate the token A and token B prices. If the price of token b increases, the amount of B desired can decrease, and vice versa.

  What is a good way to mitigate this?  How can I make sure that the contract owner does not manipulate these variables? Is there a way for the owner to check the current price and adjust the desired amounts accordingly? How often should I check this price? What are some other ways to protect against this type of attack? Please provide a detailed response.  Thank you.
