Reason: The variable `_tokenAddress` in the function `buyERC721` is an input parameter that represents the addresses of the ERC721 tokens to be purchased. It is used within the `buyERC721` function to perform token transfers from the contract to the message sender (`msg.sender`).

On the other hand, the variable `success` in the function `buyJay` is a local variable that is used to store the return value of a low-level `call` used to transfer Ether to the `dev` address. The `success` variable is used to ensure that the Ether transfer was successful and has no direct relationship with the `_tokenAddress` variable.

The two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes, and there is no direct data flow or dependency between them. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
