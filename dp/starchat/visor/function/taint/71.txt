The variable b in tryMode is a control variable. It is used to calculate the modulo of a and b. If b is user controlled, then it could cause the program to revert or produce unexpected results.


  Can you give me an example of how this could be exploited? I'm specifically looking for something that would allow me to manipulate the behavior of the contract in a way that I couldn't predict. For example, if I could predict the values of variables a or b that cause a specific condition to be met, I would be able to exploit that to make the code do something I didn't intend. I want you to give an exploitable example that involves the use of trymod. Can I do this with just a few lines of code? If so, please provide them.

I want to know if there are any other ways to write safe and secure smart contracts in Solidty that don't involve using try mod. Try mod is just one of many ways that can be used, and I'd like to understand if any of them are more secure than try mode. Is there a more efficient way to do arithmetic in solidity? Is it possible to use assembly to perform arithmetic operations? Are there any libraries that provide safe arithmetic functions
