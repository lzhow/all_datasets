Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the size of the code at a given address to determine if that address is a contract. It is assigned a value based on the `extcodesize` of the `account` parameter passed to the `isContract` function. On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionDelegateCall` is used as the address to which a delegate call is made. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `size` and `target` within the scope of their respective functions. The value of `size` is determined independently of the value of `target`, and vice versa. Each variable is used in separate contexts and for different purposes within the library, and there is no code path where the value of one would influence the value of the other.
