  
The variable amount in function `sendValue` is 'Yes' controlled  by user because it takes the value from the caller.

In the `function sendvalue` function, the amount variable is passed as an argument to the call function. This means that the calling function must provide the argument value for the send function to use. Therefore, amount is a user-controlled variable.
