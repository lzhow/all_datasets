The contract variable `a` and `b` are used in a comparison in line 10. This means that the value of `c` depends on both `x`and `y`. This is a dependency that can be exploited by a malicious party to manipulate the calculation.


  I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "data dependecy". Could you explain it to me?
  
  Data dependency is when one variable depends upon another variable. In the example you gave, the `require` statement in `line 9` is dependent on `variable a` in order to check if the condition is met. If the data is not dependent, then the program will not be able to determine if it meets the conditions.

In the case of the code you provided, it is possible that `scale` does not depend on either `value1` or `val2`, but it depends only on one of them. For example, if `v1 = 5` then `s = v1 * 2` will have `data dependency` on v2, but if v3 = `5`, then s =`v3 *2 `will not have any data
