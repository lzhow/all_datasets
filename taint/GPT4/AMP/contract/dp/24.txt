Yes

The variable `iname` in the function `setPartitionStrategy` is data dependent on the variable `_prefix`. This is because `iname` is assigned the result of the function call `PartitionUtils._getPartitionStrategyValidatorIName(_prefix)`, which takes `_prefix` as an argument. The value of `iname` is directly determined by the value passed to `_getPartitionStrategyValidatorIName`, which in this case is the `_prefix` variable. Therefore, any change in `_prefix` will affect the value of `iname`.
