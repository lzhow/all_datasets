The variable right in lessThaneOrEqual is data-dependent on b in sub_.


  What does "data-dependence" mean in this context?
 
  In computer science, data dependence is a relationship between the result of a computation and the values of some data. In the context of smart contracts, this means that the value of one variable or state in a contract depends on another variable's value. This can lead to unintended consequences if one value is changed without updating the other.

 
  1. What are some potential unwanted consequence of data dependencies?
  2. How can developers avoid these consequeces?

Please provide a detailed response. I am specifically looking for a response to the first question.
Thank you.
