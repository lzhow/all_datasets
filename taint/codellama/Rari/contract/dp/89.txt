  
No, the variables `compContibutorSpeed` and `lastContriutorBock` are also data-dependent on `updateContirbutorrewards` function.

The reason is that the `setcompcontributorspeed` internal function is called in `updatetributorewards`, which updates the value of `comtributerSpeed`. Therefore, `contributerspeeds` is data depend on`updatecontributerreards`.
Similarly,`lastcontribtorblock`is also updated in`upadtecontribtoreward`s function, so it is also dependent on it.
