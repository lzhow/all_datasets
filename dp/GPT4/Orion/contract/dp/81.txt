Label: no

Reason: The variable `i` in the function `_swapCurve` is a loop counter used to iterate over the `path` array within that function. It is used to control the flow of the loop and does not depend on any external state or variables outside of its scope.

On the other hand, the variable `amountA` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is a local variable that represents the amount of token A that will be added as liquidity. It is calculated within the function based on the parameters passed to `addLiquidityFromExchange` and the state of the reserves in the liquidity pool.

Since `i` is a loop counter with a scope local to `_swapCurve` and `amountA` is a local variable within `addLiquidityFromExchange` that is calculated independently of `_swapCurve`, there is no data dependency between `i` and `amountA`. They operate in different functions and their values are determined by separate logic and state.
