Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `claimCurrentAlphaReward`, the contract state `pools` is indeed data dependent on the variable `userData`. This is because the state of `pools` is being modified based on the value of `reward`, which is calculated by the function `calculateAlphaReward(_token, _account)`. The `reward` calculation likely depends on the user's data, which is represented by `userData`. After calculating the `reward`, the contract state `pool.totalAlphaTokenReward` is updated by subtracting the `reward` amount. Since `userData` contains information about the user's interaction with the pool (e.g., their rewards, multipliers, etc.), and this information can influence the calculation of `reward`, there is a data dependency relationship between `pools` and `userData`. The update to `pool.totalAlphaTokenReward` is indirectly dependent on the user's data, which is stored in `userData`.
