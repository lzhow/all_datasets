  
The label is 'No'.

In the `function` ` getD`, the local variable` D` is data-dependent on `xp` and `amp`. However, the global variable factory is not used in this function. Therefore, ` D ` is independent of ` factory`.
On the other hand, in ` function` get `AmountinUniversall`, `amountIn` depends on` factory`,`from`, and`to`. Therefore ` amountin `is data - dependent on factory.
Therefore, there is no data dependence between `dprev `and`factory`.
