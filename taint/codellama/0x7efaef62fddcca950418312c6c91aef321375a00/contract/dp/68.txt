  
No, the variables `_ reserve ​​0 `and` to` are independent in function` mint` and function'burn`.

In function 'm int', the value of` _ reserve` is calculated based on` balance  `of the token and the total supply of the contract. This value is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in` burn` function,`_reserver` value depends on `balancel` of token  and` total Supply`of contract, but this value does not depend on variable`to`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between` `_ reservoir`and ` to`.
