The ` borrow amount ` is calculated using the formula:
`borrrow amount = (ctoken' total borrows / c token' borrowindex)`
This formula is derived from the ctokens' `total borrrows` and `Borrrow index` which are both controlled internally by c tokens. Therefore, ` Borrow Amount `  is also controlled internaly by Ctokes.
