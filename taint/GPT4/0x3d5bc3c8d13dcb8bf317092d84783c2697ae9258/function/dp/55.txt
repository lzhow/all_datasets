Label: yes

Reason: The variable `vars` in the function `repayBorrowFresh` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `doTransferIn`. This is because `vars.repayAmount` is either set to the value of `repayAmount` or `vars.accountBorrows` based on the condition `if (repayAmount == uint(-1))`. Then, `vars.actualRepayAmount` is assigned the return value of `doTransferIn(payer, vars.repayAmount)`, which means that the `amount` parameter of `doTransferIn` is directly influenced by the value of `vars.repayAmount`. Since `vars.actualRepayAmount` is dependent on the output of `doTransferIn`, which in turn is dependent on its input parameter `amount`, there is a data dependency relationship between `vars` in `repayBorrowFresh` and `amount` in `doTransferIn`.
