yes

The variable `mid` in the function `findUpperBound` is data dependent on the variable `low` because `mid` is calculated using the `Math.average` function, which takes `low` and `high` as arguments. The value of `mid` directly depends on the values of `low` and `high` at each iteration of the while loop. Since `low` is one of the inputs to the calculation of `mid`, any changes to `low` would affect the value of `mid`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `mid` and `low`.
