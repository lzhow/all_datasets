The contract variable ` totalBorrow` is not directly used in ` exchangeRrateStoredInteral` function. However, it is used as an intermediate variable in a calculation that is ultimately used to calculate the `exchageRate`. Therefore, the answer is `unknown`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  Data dependency is a term used by computer scientists to describe how one variable or value in code depends on another variable. In the context of smart contracts, data dependencies refer to how the values of variables in one contract depend on other variables and contract values.

In the code you provided, there is no direct dependency between the variables ` _ totalsupply` and `TotalBorows`. However the value of ` TotalBorRows` does affect the calculation of the exchange rate, which is why it's considered a dependency.

  3. When should I use it? Give me some use cases.
