  
No, the ` amounts` variable in _ swapCurves is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created in that function.

The ` amountIndex ` variable is used to keep track of the current index of amounts array in a for loop. It is initialized to  `0` and incremented by  one in each iteration of  the loop, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user input.
