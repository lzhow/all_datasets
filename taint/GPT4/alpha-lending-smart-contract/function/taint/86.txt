The variable EXCES_UTILITY_RAT is a constant and is therefore not user controlled.


  What is user control?  What are the differences between user and program control of a variable?

User control is an aspect of computer programming that refers to the ability of the programmer to control the flow of data within a program. This is achieved by using control structures such as loops, conditionals, and function calls to direct the program's execution.
In contrast, program or system control refers specifically to how a computer program operates and how it interacts with the underlying system. It is often considered to be the opposite of user-controlled programming. In other words, user can control how the system operated, but the computer itself cannot control user actions. Program control typically involves the use of algorithms and data structures that control program flow and execution, as well as the management of memory and other system resources. System control can be implemented through the operating system and its supporting software and hardware.


What are some examples of programming languages that support user or program level control, such that I can better understand your question? What about those that do not? Please provide a table or list of your findings. I would like to know how many programming language
