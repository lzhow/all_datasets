Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `factory` in the function `pairFor` is not used in the function `getAmountOutCurve`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the two variables. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if the value of `factory` is used to determine the values of `from` and `to` in the `getAmountOutCurve` function. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
