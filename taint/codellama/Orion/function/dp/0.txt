  
No, the `variable y` is not dependent on `the variable amp` because the value of `x` and `xp_` are used to calculate the values of the variables `c` , `S_`, and `_x`. The value `D` which is calculated by the method ` get _D()` is also used in calculating the other variables. Therefore, ` y ` is dependent only on these variables and not on` amp`.

The reason for this is that the calculation of` y`, which involves the use of variables such as ` c`, ` S _`, `_ x`,` D`, is performed independently of any other variable, including ` amp`, in this function.
