  
No, the ` value` variable in function `_safeTranfer` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` _ safeTranser` function is called by other functions in contract, and the value of `amount` parameter is passed to it. Therefore, ` amount` cannot be controlled directly by a user, but rather by another function that calls `_ safeTansfer`.
