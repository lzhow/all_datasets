Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `balance1` in the `mint` function of the `PancakePair` contract is indirectly controlled by the user. This variable is assigned the balance of `token1` that the contract holds:

```solidity
uint balance1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));
```

Since `token1` is an ERC20 token, its balance can be influenced by users through transfers, approvals, and other interactions with the token contract. When a user calls the `mint` function, they may have previously sent `token1` tokens to the contract address, thus affecting the `balance1` variable. Therefore, the value of `balance1` depends on the actions of the users, making it controlled by the user.
