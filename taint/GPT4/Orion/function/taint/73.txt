Explanation: The variable `i` in the function `getAmountInCurve` is not controlled by the user. It is used as an input parameter to determine the index of the token in the `xp` array. The value of `i` is obtained from the `get_coin_indices` function, which is not controlled by the user. Therefore, the variable `i` is not controlled by the user.
