Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `scalar` in the function `divScalar` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter of the function and its value is passed as an argument when the function is called. The value of `scalar` can be determined by the user or any other external entity, but it is not directly controlled by the user within the contract itself. Therefore, the label for the variable `scalar` is unknown.
