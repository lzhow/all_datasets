Explanation:
In the first function, the `if` statement checks if ` amountin` is equal to 0, and if so, it reverts the transaction.
However, in both functions, `reservesIn`, ` reservesOut`, and `direction` are passed as arguments, which are used to calculate the amount of tokens that can be bought or sold.  The `numerator` and the`denominator `are calculated using the same formula, but with different variables. Therefore, both variables are dependent on each other.
