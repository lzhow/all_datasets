Explanation: Based on the given code snippet, it is not clear whether the contract state `original` is data dependent on the variable `success_` in the function `transfer`. The code provided does not show any direct interaction or assignment between the `original` contract state and the `success_` variable. Therefore, without further information or context, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship between these two entities.
