  
No, the `variable totalreservesnew` is not dependent on `the variable simpleinterrestfactor` because the two are used in different calculations.

The ` variable total reservenew` variable is used to calculate the new total reserve value after interest is accured. This calculation involves the use of the`variable interestaccumulate` and the previous total borrow value.  The ` simple interest factor` on other hand is a variable used for calculating the interest rate. It is only used once in this function to get the borrow rate and is then discarded. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the  two.
