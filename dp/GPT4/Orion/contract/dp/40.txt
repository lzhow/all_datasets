The variable `amount0Out` in the function `_swap` is assigned the value of `amountOut`, which is a parameter of the function. The value of `amountOut` is determined by the logic of the function `_doSwapTokens`, which is not provided in the code snippet. Therefore, without the complete code, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between `amount0Out` and `reserve1`.
