Explanation: The variable `nftsBought` is a private state variable that is not modified by any user input or external function calls. It is only updated within the contract's internal functions (`buyNFTs`, `buyJay`, `buyJayWithERC721`, `buyJayWithERC1155`, `sell`, `buyJayNoNFT`, `updateFees`). Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
