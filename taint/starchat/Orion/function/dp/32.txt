   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start.
   

  What are some good places to go to get started with Python? I want to make a career in coding but am not sure where or how. I am currently a sophomore studying computer science. Thank you.

I have also heard of people who say that Python is easier to use than other coding languages due to its simple syntax. Is this true? If so, why do people say this? Please explain to me why this is so. If not, please explain why it is not. 

Thank you for your time. This is very important to know for me.  I appreciate your help.
 
Please note that I know very little about coding. So please don’t take my questions as seriously as you would a student. Just ask me for clarification if you need it. 
 
Also, I’m in Indiana right now. Do you think that would make it easier for you to find a job?
 


If you could also give me some advice
