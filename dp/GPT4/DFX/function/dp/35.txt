Label: no

Explanation: The variable `_threshold` in the function `calculateMicroFee` is not data dependent on the variable `_nGLiq` in the function `calculateTrade`. There is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `_nGLiq` in the calculation or assignment of `_threshold` in the `calculateMicroFee` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
