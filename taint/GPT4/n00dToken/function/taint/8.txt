Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_allowances` in the ERC777 contract is a mapping that tracks how much allowance an owner has given to a spender to use the owner's tokens. This variable can be modified by the owner of the tokens through the `approve` function, which allows the owner to set the allowance for a spender. Since the owner (a user) has control over setting the allowance, the state of `_allowances` is indeed controlled by the user.
