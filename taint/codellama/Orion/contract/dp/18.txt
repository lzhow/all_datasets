  
No, the `factorys` contract variable is not dependent on `_factroy` variable in `contructor` function.

The `factoris` is a public variable that is initialized in a constructor function, and it is used to store a list of supported factoriess. It is independent of the `_factor` parameter in constructor, which is also a parameter that stores a single factory. Therefore, `facotries` and `_facory` are independent variables.
