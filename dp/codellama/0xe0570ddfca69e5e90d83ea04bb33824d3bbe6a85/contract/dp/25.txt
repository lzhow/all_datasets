  
No, the `_ diff` variable in function  ` withdraw` is data-dependent on variable  `_bal` from function   `earn`.

The reason is that the  function` withdraw `calls the `bal `function, which calls the` ear ` function, and the value of `_ bal` changes in ` ear`. Therefore, `_ _ diff `is not dependent on` b` but on `_ balance`.
