  
No, the variables `suppyCap` and `totalSuppy` are independent of the `money` variable in `function mintAllwed`.

The reason is that the two functions are in different contracts, and the state of one contract does not affect the other contract.
In addition, `SuppCap`, `TotalSupp`, and`mone`y are all local variables in their respective functions, so they do not have any dependencies on each other.
