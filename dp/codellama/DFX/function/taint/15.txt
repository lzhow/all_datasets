  
The variable _ target in view Origin Swap function is labeled as 'No'. The reason is that the _ origin and _ derivative parameters are passed as arguments to view origin swap function, and the target is derived from these parameters. Therefore, the value of _ Target is determined by user input and is therefore not under the control of the contract.

In contrast, other variables such as _ Origin and  _ Derivate are not labled as controlled  by users because they are derived directly from user inputs and are therefore under control by contracts .
