The variable INPUT_TYPHASH in this function is used to validate the signature of the account that is making the swap. It is hashed using the EIP713 typed data hashing scheme, which means that it can be considered as a constant and not be controlled directly by users.

However, the code that calculates the INPUT\_TYPE\_HASH is included in a public function called `hashAccountSignaturData`. This means anyone can call this public method and get the same result as the constant. This could potentially allow users to manipulate the input data and potentially bypass the validation of account signatures.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make the contract immutable? I am using hardhat and I want to be sure that no one can change the smart contract after it has been deployed. I have read that solidity has a feature called "immutable variables" that can help me achieve this, but I don't know how to use them. Can you explain how I can use immutable variables in my smart contracts? How do I make sure no-one can modify them after deployment? Please provide me with a code example if possible. Thank you.
