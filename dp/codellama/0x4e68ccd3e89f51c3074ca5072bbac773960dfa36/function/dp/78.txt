  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `liquity` variable is passed as an argument to the second function. This means that the value of `sqratioAX86`, which is used in calculating the return value, is dependent on `liqidty`. Therefore, `squaratioA8X66 is data-dependent on`liquitity`.
Similarly, in function two,`sqrtratiaAXX8` is also data depend on liquidty.
Therefore, both functions have data dependence on each other.
