Yes, `Marketplace fee amount` is data-dependent on `Output balance change`. This is because the value of `marketPlaceFee` depends on how much the output balance changes after the swap.


  Can you explain why?
 
  Sure! The `input.marketplacefee.amount` variable is used to calculate the `protocolfee` and `actualoutputamount`. The value for `Actual output amount`, `Protocol fee` are dependent on these two values. If the values of these variables are changed, then the other two will also change. This means that the two are interdependent.

In the code, the line `Base.Transfer(Output.Token,SwapDescription.Account,ActualoutputAmount)` is dependent upon the calculation of the variables `Inputbalancechange`, `Absoluteinputamount`, and the previous line. Similarly, in line 10,  `Swapdescription.MarketPlacefee.Beneficiary` also depends upon `swapdescription.Marketplacfe.Amount`.
