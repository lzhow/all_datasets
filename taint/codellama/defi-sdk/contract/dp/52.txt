  
No, the variables ` protocol fee signature` and ` market place fee amount` are independent.

The variable  `validateProtocol feeSignatures` is a function parameter that is passed to the ` validate Protoco fee Signatures ` function. It is not dependent on any other variable in this function or any function called within this one.  The variable` marketPlaceF eeAmount ` is also a local variable within the` get Returned Amoun ts` function, and it is only used within that function to calculate the returned amount. Therefore, it does not affect the data dependence of the  variable protocol F eesignature .
