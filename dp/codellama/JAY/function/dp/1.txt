  
No, the `contract state buyNFTFessJAY` is not dependent on `variable amounts` within the context of the given function.

The `function buy ERC 1 5 6` has a local variable called ` amount` that is used to keep track of how many tokens are being bought. This variable is updated within a loop that iterates over the array of token IDs and amounts. However, this variable does not depend on any other variables in this function, including the input parameter ` amounts`. Therefore, it is safe to say that the state of ` buy NFT Fee JA Y` does  not rely on this input.
