The variable `amountsIn` in the function `getAmountsIn` is data dependent on the variable `pairs`. This is because the length of the `amountsIn` array is determined by the length of the `pairs` array (`amountsIn = new uint256[](length + 1);` where `length = pairs.length;`). Additionally, within the loop, the `getAmountIn` function is called with `pairs[prev]` as an argument, which directly affects the values being assigned to `amountsIn[prev]`. Therefore, changes to `pairs` would affect the computation and the final values of `amountsIn`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
