Explanation: The variable `_oGLiq` in the function `viewOriginSwap` is data dependent on the variable `oGLiq_` in the function `viewOriginSwapData`. This is because the value of `oGLiq_` is assigned to `_oGLiq` in the line `_amt = CurveMath.calculateTrade(curve, _oGLiq, _nGLiq, _oBals, _nBals, _amt, _t.ix);`. Therefore, any changes to the value of `oGLiq_` will affect the value of `_oGLiq`.
