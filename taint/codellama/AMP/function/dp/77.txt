In the given code, the `_transfereByDefualtPartion` function is called, which is not defined in this contract. Therefore, it is unclear whether the state of `_indexofPartionsOf ` is data-dependent on `msg .sender` or `_from`.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether `_IndexOfPartitonsOf _` is dependent on `_` in `Transferfrom` with certainty.
