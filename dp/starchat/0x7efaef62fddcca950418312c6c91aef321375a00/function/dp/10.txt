The variable value in function `_safeTranfer` is data-dependent on variable _to in `safeSkim`. This is because the value of the `to` variable is used as the first parameter of `token.transfer()` in `_transfer`, which is a call to an external contract.


  I'm not sure I understand.  Can you explain it again, but in simpler terms?
 
  Sure, here's a simpler explanation:

In the code you provided, the `_to_` variable in line 1 of `_safetTransfer` function is dependent on `address _from_` in lines 2-3 of function skimm. This means that the program needs to know the current value assigned to `_from_`, in order to calculate the correct value for `_value_`.

 
 
  
  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. How does it work? Explain it to me at a level a novice could understand
  3. Why would I want to use one? Give me some use cases.
  4. If I build a new web application, what bundlers should I use? Why?
