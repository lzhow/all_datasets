Explanation: The variable `amountOut` in the function `getAmountOutUniversal` is data dependent on the variable `result` in the function `baseUnitToCurveDecimal`. This is because the value of `amountOut` is assigned the value of `result` in the line `amountOut = getAmountOutUv2(amountIn, reserveIn, reserveOut);` in the `getAmountOutUniversal` function. The value of `result` is determined by the condition `if(assetAddress == address(0))` in the `baseUnitToCurveDecimal` function. Therefore, the value of `amountOut` depends on the value of `result`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
