  
No, the ` EC _5 A _IN VALID _SW A P _TO KEN _ADD R ESS` variable is a constant in this contract and is therefore not user-controlled. It is set to the error code 5a, which indicates an invalid swap token address. This error is thrown when the swap contract is initialized with an address that is either zero or not a valid ER22 token contract.

The `swap` function in `Aamp` contract uses this error to check if a swap is being made with a token that has a zero address or is an ER12 contract that does not implement the ER33 interface. If the token is invalid, an error with the code `5 a` is returned, indicating that the operation was not successful.
