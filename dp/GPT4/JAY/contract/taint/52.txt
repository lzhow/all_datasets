The variable `price` in the function `updateFees` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `price` is obtained from the `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` function, which retrieves the latest price from an external data source (an oracle). The user does not have direct control over the value of `price`, as it is determined by the external data source.
