The variable `i` in the function `getFee` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `i` is a local variable declared within the for loop in the `getFee` function. It is used as a loop counter to iterate over the `_bals` array. The value of `i` is determined by the loop structure and is not influenced by any user input or external factors. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
