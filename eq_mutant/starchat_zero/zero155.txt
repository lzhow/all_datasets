No, the code is not semantic equal in the sense that it does the exact same thing.

While the first loop iterates 5 times with i ranging from 0 to 4, incrementing by 1 each loop, each iteration of the inner loop increments j by exactly 2 (i.e. j=2*i), leading to a situation where the last value of j, j>4 in this case, is the condition for exiting the loop. This results in a segmentation fault since accessing a[4] when a has only length 3 will result in an array out of bounds error or worse. The mutant code avoids this issue by dividing i by one, effectively halving the increment value for the second loop (j). The value assigned to j in each subsequent iteration will be 7, 8,..., 9, resulting in j still being less than 6 when the outer loop reaches the ith iteration and the program should be able to run correctly without error.
