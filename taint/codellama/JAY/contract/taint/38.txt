The reason is that the value of `` comes from the `total_supply` function, which is defined in line 30 of your code. This function returns the current total number of Jay tokens in existence, and it does not depend on any user input. Therefore, `` cannot be controlled directly by a user, but rather is determined by other factors such as the number and distribution of tokens and the price of Ether.
