`interesAcculated ` is calculated using the `mul_` function, which takes two arguments: `simpleinterstFator` and ` totalborrows`. ` simpleintersFtor` is also calculated in ` finishinterestsAccrulal` using ` mul _` with `borrowRateManitissa` as an argument. Therefore, ` interestaccumlated` depends on `totaborowsnew`.
