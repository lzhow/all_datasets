Reason: The variable `token` in the function `safeApprove` is an input parameter that represents an ERC20 token interface. The variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeDecreaseAllowance` is a local variable that is calculated within the scope of that function by decreasing the current allowance by `value`. There is no direct data flow from `token` to `newAllowance` within the given code snippet. Each function operates independently with their own set of parameters and local variables. There is no shared state or dependency between `token` in `safeApprove` and `newAllowance` in `safeDecreaseAllowance` as presented in the code.
