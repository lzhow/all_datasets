Label: no

Explanation: The variable `_totalShells` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the value of `curve.totalSupply`, which is a state variable of the `Storage.Curve` contract. The value of `curve.totalSupply` is not directly controlled by the user, but rather determined by the state of the contract. Therefore, the label is 'no'.
