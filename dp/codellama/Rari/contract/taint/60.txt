  
The label is 'No'.

In the `mul` function, the value of `a` is passed as an argument, and the multiplication is performed using the operator `*`. The value `c` that is returned is calculated as ` a*b`. Since the argument ` b`is passed to the mul function and not modified within the body of the method, ` c` cannot be controlled directly by a user input. Therefore, we can conclude that the state of variable b is uncontrolled by user in this function.
