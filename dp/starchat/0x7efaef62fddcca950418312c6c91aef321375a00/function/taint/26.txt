The variable 'denomiator' in function '_mintfee' is a control variable that is used to calculate the amount of liqudity that will be minted to the fee recipient. It is calculated using the formula:

liquidiy = min ( amount_0 * total_supply / reserve_1, amount  _1 *total_suply /reserve_2)
denominatior = sqrt (reserve  * reserve) + sqrt (_K_last) 

where K_Last is an internal variable used in calculating the price of the pair.
Since the '_safeTranfer' function is called within the'mint' fuction, and the msg sender is 'address (this)', it can be assumed that the value of'reserve' variables are controlled and can therefore be considered as user controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at coding. I've never seen something like that before. Can I use it for my own projects? If yes, how? And if no, why? Please explain it in simple terms for a beginner like me. Thank you!
