  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the code, the `div_` function is used to calculate the value of ` borrowAccumulated` based on `marketBorrrowIndex` and `CTokens.totalborrows`. The `mul_ ` function calculates the product of the two values. Therefore, ` compaccrual` is dependent on both ` marketborrrowindex`and ` ctokens. totalborows`.
