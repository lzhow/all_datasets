In the `tryDiv` function, the expression `a /b` is evaluated, which involves the variables ` a` and `b`. The `require` statement in ` div` also involves ` b`, which is a different variable from `  a`. However, since the value of ` ` is not used in any way in either function after it is assigned, it can be considered as not being data-dependent on ` `.
