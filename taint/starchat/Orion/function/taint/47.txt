Is the contract address controlled or not?

A contract account is an Ethereum account that is created by a contract and holds Ether (ETH), code (smart contracts) or both. Contract accounts are typically associated with smart contracts, which are programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.
Contract accounts can be created in two ways:
- By a user who deploys a smart contract to the blockchain, resulting in a new contract being created and its address being assigned to a specific user's wallet. This is known as a "contract creation transaction".
The user can then interact with the smart-contract by sending transactions to its contract-address. These transactions are executed by running the code of the deployed smartcontract, and modifying the state of its associated contract.
 
  The contract is deployed by an account, so it can't be controlled directly. However, the account can control the deployment of contracts. If the owner of an address can deploy contracts to that address, then it's possible for that contract's code to be modified by that owner. In this case, that modified code could potentially be used to control variables in that smart contact. It's important to note that this is a complex attack vector that can have serious
