The function `internal _ transferByDefault Partition` is a helper function for the `transfer` function. It is used to transfer tokens from one account to another.

In the `_ transferByDefaulPartition ` function, the first parameter `default Partition ` is not a state variable, but a constant. This means that it is treated as a compile-time constant and does not change during the execution of the program. Therefore, it doesnot have any data dependencies on other contract variables.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the state variables `balances` and `supplyByParition` are dependent on `_ value`.
 
  The state of `balance` depends on `value`, but `partition` does no have this dependency. `Partition`, in this context, is just a label for a set of accounts. In the context of this function it has no bearing on whether or not the transfer is successful.

  The function is correct. However, if you are looking for an example of how to implement a transfer function that is partitioned, you can look at the OpenZeppelin library's implementation of ERC20Partition.sol. Here is an excerpt from the library:
