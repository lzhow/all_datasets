The variable `low` in the function `findUpperBound` is data dependent on the variable `array`. This is because the value of `low` is determined through the while loop, which iterates based on the condition `low < high`, where `high` is initially set to `array.length`. Inside the loop, `low` is updated based on the comparison between `array[mid]` and `element`. If `array[mid]` is not greater than `element`, `low` is set to `mid + 1`. Additionally, after the loop, there is a check that uses `array[low - 1]` to determine the return value. The value of `low` is thus influenced by the contents and length of `array`, establishing a data dependency relationship between `low` and `array`.
