The contract function "swap" is used to transfer tokens from one address to another. It first checks that the allowance of the token being transferred is greater than 1, and if it is, it transfers the tokens and emits a Swap event.

However, the data dependence relationship between the `_to` and `_amount` variables and the `msg` variable is not clear. Specifically, whether the value of `_mint` depends on `_transfer` or vice versa is unclear. Additionally, there is no mention of data dependencies between `_supply` (the total supply of tokens) and `Swap` events.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that I am a code analysis for Solidty smart contracts. Could you please re-write the question to reflect this?
 
  Sure, here's a rewritten version of your question that better reflects your role as a Solidit smart contract analysis:
Is the smart contact state variable "balance" data-dependent on contract variable "_to"?
