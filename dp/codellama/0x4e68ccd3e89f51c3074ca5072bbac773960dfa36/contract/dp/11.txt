  
No, the ` denominatior_ scope_  ` variable in ` get NextS qrt PriceFrom Amount0 Rounding Up` is not dependent on ` liquidit y` variable  from ` GetNext S q rt Price From Output`.

The reason is that the value of ` denomina tor_ s cop e_ ` is calculated using the expression ` numerat or_ _1 `, which is a constant value that is defined in terms of the input parameters of  the  function.  The value  of` numer ator_2 `is also a  constant  value, and the result of dividing these two values is also constant. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
