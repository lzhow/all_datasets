  
The variable 'self' in function 'cross' is a mapping of type 'int 44' to 'Tik. Info' which is defined in a library. It is an internal variable and is therefore not directly controlled or manipulated by a user, and therefore the answer is 'No'.

In general, a variable is considered controlled if it can be manipulable by an external actor, such as a malicious user or a smart contract. In the case of a Solidiy contract, the variables are typically defined as part of the contract's state, which can only be modified by calling the functions defined by that contract or by other contracts that interact with it. Therefore, variables that are defined within a contract are not considered to be controlled directly by users.
However, if a function is called with a parameter that is derived from user input, then that parameter can potentially be used to manipulate the state of that function, making the corresponding variable controlled. For example, in this case, function `cross` takes a `mapping` of `int4` to `Tic.info` as an argument, but the mapping is created by another function that takes user-supplied data as input. This means that the `map` can contain user data, so the data in `info`, which are the values of this map, are also controlled and can therefore be considered as controlled variables.
