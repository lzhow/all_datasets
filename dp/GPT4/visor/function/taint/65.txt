  
The variable 'to' in function 'safeTranser' is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the 'from' parameter is passed as an argument to the safe transfer function, which means that the address of the sender is determined by a user input. Therefore, the value of ' to' can be controlled or influenced by an external user, making it a variable that is under the control of a malicious user or an attacker.
