Reason: The contract state `balanceOf` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve1` in the function `burn`. This is because the value of `_reserve1` influences the execution of the `_mintFee` function, which can potentially change the state of `balanceOf`. The `_mintFee` function is called with `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` as arguments, and depending on the implementation of `_mintFee`, it may result in a change to the contract's state, including `balanceOf`. Additionally, the `balanceOf` is used to calculate `amount0` and `amount1`, which are then burned from the contract's balance using `_burn`. The `_burn` function could potentially alter the `balanceOf` mapping. Since `_reserve1` is used in a function that can affect the contract's state, and `balanceOf` is part of the contract's state that is being modified within the same function, there is a data dependency relationship between `balanceOf` and `_reserve1`.
