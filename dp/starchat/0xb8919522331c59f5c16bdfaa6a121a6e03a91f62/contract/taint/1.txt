The variable proxy in function `upgradeAndcall` is a controlled variable. It is passed into the `msg` parameter of the transaction, and therefore can be modified by any party that has access to the blockchain.


  How can I prevent this? I want to make sure that the proxy is only controlled and modified in my smart contract. How do I do this in Solidty? Can you give me an example?

I want the address of my proxy to be stored in a variable that is accessible only to my contract, so that I can restrict access. I don't want any other party to have access, even if they have the contract's address.
Can you write me a Solidit example that meets these requirements? Please include comments and best practices for this type of situation. 

Thank you





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples? Is it like Webpack or Rollup? Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced.  I am specifically looking for a high- level overview and the key concepts. Thanks!
