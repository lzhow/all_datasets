The ` price ` variable is derived from the `latest Round Data` function of an external contract called `Aggregate V3 Interface`, and it represents a price feed that provides the latest price for the JPY/US Dollar exchange rate. This price is used to calculate the fees for buying and selling NFT tokens.
