  
No, the ` amount` variable in ` get Buy Jay No NFT` is not dependent on ` price` from ` Get Latest Price`.

The `Get Latet Price` function returns the current price of the JPY/USDT pair, which is used to calculate the exchange rate between JYP and USDT. However, this price is only used in calculating the amount of JPJ that can be bought with a given amount in USDC.
On the other hand, `Amount` represents the number of USTC that the user wants to buy, and it is passed as an argument to the` Get BuuJYNo NFt`function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
