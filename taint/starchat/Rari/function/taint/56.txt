The variable b in mod() is user-controlled.

In Solidty, the modulus operator % can be used to calculate the remainder of a division operation. For example, 5 % 2 = 1, since  the division  of  five by two results in  two  whole numbers and one remainder. In the case of the modulo operator, if b is a user input, then it can result in a remainder that is greater than or equal to b. This means that the result of mod can potentially be negative, which is an invalid value for the type of b used in this function.


  Can you give me an example of how to exploit this? I'm trying to do a simple "guess the number" game on the ethereum blockchain
 
  Sure, here's an exploit for a "Guess the Number" smart contract on Ethereum:

1. Deploy the contract with a random number as the answer.

2. Have the player submit a guess. If the guess is correct, withdraw the funds from the smart
   contract. However, note that if you're using SolidITY, you'll need to use the "send" function
   instead of "transfer" to withdraw all of your funds. Also
