Unknown. The variable `actualRepayAmount` in the function `liquidateBorrowFresh` is not directly dependent on the variable `vars` in the function `seizeInternal`. However, it is possible that the value of `actualRepayAmount` is indirectly influenced by the execution of `seizeInternal` through other variables or functions within the code. Without further analysis of the code, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these two variables.
