Label: no

Reason: The contract state `mantissaOne` is not present in the provided Solidity contract code. Since it does not exist in the code, there can be no data dependency relationship between `mantissaOne` and the variable `deltaIndex` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp`. Data dependency implies that the value of one variable is derived from or affects the value of another. Since `mantissaOne` is not part of the contract, no such relationship can be established.
