The function calls are:

intakenumerairolpratio(assm, 100,01,1)
delegate(address, bytes) -> bytes
abi.deocde(bytes, (uin224)) -> (115792089338609078054995887)


 1. Is the `ass` variable in `delegate` data-dependent on `data`?
2. If so, is it data dependend on `_amt`? 
3. And if so is `_assum` dependent on any other variables?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I have heard that it is important to practice a lot, but I don't know where to start.   There are many resources available to help you learn Python. Here are some suggestions:

1 - Codecademy: This is an interactive website that offers a series of courses on Python programming. It has a gamified approach, where you earn points for completing exercises and completions.

2 - FreeCodeCamp: Similar to CodeCademy
