Explanation:
In the first function, the `_ token` variable is passed as an argument to the `IER C2O(_ token). balanceOf()` function. This function returns the balance of the token in `_tokens` address.
Then, this balance is assigned to `uint2 5 6amount`.
Finally, ` amount` is used as a parameter in ` I ERC 2 O(_ toke n). safeTransfe r( msg. sender, amoun t)`.
Therefore, `_ tok en` and `amoun` are dependent on each other.
