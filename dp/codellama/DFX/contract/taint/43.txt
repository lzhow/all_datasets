The variable _ assetWeighs is an array of uint  types. It is passed as an argument to the initialize function, which means that it can be controlled only by a user who calls the contract. However, the array is initialized with a fixed length of 3, and the values of its elements are not modified within the code. Therefore, its values are determined at the time of deployment and cannot be changed by any user after that.
