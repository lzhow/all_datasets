The variable `transferTokens` in `function transferAllow(....)` is a control variable that is passed in by a user and is used to determine if a transfer is allowed. Since it's a parameter, the value of `transfereTokens `is controlled directly by whoever is calling the `tranferAllow` function.


  Can you write a python program that takes a Solidty function and returns the list of variables that are controlled?  You can use the AST module to parse the code.  The program should be able to handle all Soliditiy versions.   You should also handle modifiers and inline assembly.
