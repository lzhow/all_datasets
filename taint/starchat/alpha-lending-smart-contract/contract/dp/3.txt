   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  
   An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web application by combining multiple files into a single file. It is also used for code splitting, which is breaking down the large code base into smaller chunks. Incremental bundlers like Webpack and Rollup are widely used in web development. They can bundle together the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files in a web project and optimize them for better performance.

Benefits of using an incremental bundle tool:
- Faster page load time: By reducing the number of requests made to server, incremental bundles can improve the page loading time.  This is especially important for applications that have slow internet connections.  
Incremental bundles also reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded, making the application more efficient. 

Tools like WebPack and Browserify are used as incremental build tools. These tools can be integrated with a development server that watches for changes in files and automatically rebuilds the bundle
