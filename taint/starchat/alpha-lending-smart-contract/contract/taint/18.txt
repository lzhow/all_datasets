The variable _ amount is a parameter of the accumuleAlphatoUser function, and it represents the amount of ALPHA tokens that the caller wants to deposit. It is therefore controlled indirectly by msg sender.


  How can I be sure that this is correct? I'm not a security expert, so I don't know how to check if a contract is secure. Can you please explain how I can check this myself? Is there a tool that can help me with this? Please also provide me some references to read up on this topic.

Thank you





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?
A J-Pert P LL algorithm is used to solve a Rubik's Cube.  The algorithm was developed by Jerry Perry in 87.   The JP algorithm uses a recursive algorithm to permute the corners, edges, then centers.    The P part of JPP is for permutations, the L part is to label the pieces, which is done by examining the current state of each piece and assigning a label.     The LL part refers to a loop of two passes through the algorithm.      The first pass assigns labels to each of 4
