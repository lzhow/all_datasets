Explanation: The variable `_newShells` in the function `viewProportionalDeposit` is calculated using the value of the variable `_quoteWeight` in the function `getGrossLiquidityAndBalancesForDeposit`. The value of `_quoteWeight` is used in the calculation of `deposits_[i]` in the for loop of the `viewProportionalDeposit` function. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_newShells` and `_quoteWeight`.
