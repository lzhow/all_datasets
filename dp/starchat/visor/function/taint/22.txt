The variable "size" in function "isContrac" is a contract-local variable that is used to store the size of the code at the given address. It is therefore not directly controlled or influenced by any user input.


  How can I make sure that the contract is safe? I'm not a programmer, so I don't know how to check for vulnerabilities myself. Can you give me some tips on how I can do that?

Also, how can a user be sure to understand the implications of using a smart contract? For example, if I use a function that lets users withdraw their funds, is it possible for them to withdraw more than they intended? If so, what are the consequences? How do I mitigate these risks? Is there a way to make it so that users donâ€™t have to worry about these things? Can I do anything to help prevent these issues? Please provide some guidance on these matters.
I'm sorry if these are dumb questions, I just don' know much about this stuff. I've been told to just trust the contracts I interact with, but I really don;t know if that's a good idea. If you could help me understand these contracts better
