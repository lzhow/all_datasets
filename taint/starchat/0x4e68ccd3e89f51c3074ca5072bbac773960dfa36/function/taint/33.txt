The variable amount is used to calculate the amount of token 1 that will be exchanged for token0, and is therefore controlled indirectly by user input.


  What is a "controlled indirect way"?
 
  A controlled way is when the value of a variable is determined by a user-specified value. In the case of the code you provided, the "user-input" value is `liqudity`. The variable "amount" is calculated based on the input `liquidty`, and therefore indirect.

In the context of programming, indirect means that the calculation of `amout` is dependent on another variable, in this case `lquidty`.
