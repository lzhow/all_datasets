Label: no

Reason: The variable `liquidity` in the function `write` is an input parameter that is used to create or update an `Observation` within the `self` array. The variable `i` in the function `grow` is a loop counter used to iterate over the `self` array and set the `blockTimestamp` of each `Observation` to 1. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `liquidity` and `i`. The `liquidity` value is not influenced by the value of `i`, nor does it affect the loop's behavior in `grow`. They operate in different contexts and are used for different purposes within their respective functions.
