The variable admin hasRights is a state variable in CompTroller. It is used to determine if a user has the right to call certain functions in a smart contract. In this case, the functions that can be called by a non-admin user are limited to those that do not modify the state of the contract, such as reading data from public variables.

In this specific case the admin variable is set to the address of a contract that implements the IFUSEFeeDistribution interface. This contract is responsible for distributing fees generated by FUSE token holders. Since this contract has access to sensitive information about the Fuse protocol, and can potentially be used by hackers to steal Fuses, this variable should be considered to be controlled and modified by users.


  How can I prevent my users from modifying this state? Is there a way to make it so that the value of this field cannot be changed by anyone except the smart-contract itself? If not, what are some other ways I can enforce that this value cannot change?
Can you give me an example of how to do this? I want to use this smartcontract in my dAPP, but I don't want my user to change the values of admin and adminRights.
