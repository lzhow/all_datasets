The function viewSwap is a view function, which means that it does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the variables in nBal_ are dependent on variables outside of nbal_.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand your answer. Could you please explain what you mean by "dependent on"?
  
  Dependent means related. In this case, the nBalance_ variable in getSwapOriginData is dependent upon the input variable _amount.
