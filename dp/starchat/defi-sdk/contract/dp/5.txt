  How about the other way around?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to do this for a living, and I don't want a low paying job as a result.  I know some javascript and some c++, but I think python is much easier to pick up. What should I do? Should I start with a book? A video? Or is it better to find a bootcamp? Please help me find the best path forward. Thank you.

I am asking you this question because you have been very helpful to me in getting me to where I'm at. So far, you've been most helpful with answering my toughest questions and helping me understand things better. And I want you to know that I appreciate that. But I still feel like I need a little push in order to get past this wall that seems to be preventing me from moving forward in my career. 

Please help. This is important to my future. Thanks.
