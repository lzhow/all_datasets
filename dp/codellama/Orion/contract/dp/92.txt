  
No, the ` supported Factories ` contract is not dependent on ` token A ` in function ` _ add Liquidty `.

The `add Liqidtiy` function creates a new pair if it does not exist, and the pair is created using the factory address and two token addresses. This means that the creation of the new pool is independent of `toke A` and `supporteFactoriess` is also not affected by it.
