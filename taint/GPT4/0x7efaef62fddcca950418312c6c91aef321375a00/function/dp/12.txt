Reason: In the provided Solidity function `_mintFee`, the variable `denominator` is used to calculate the amount of liquidity to be minted as a fee. If the condition `if (liquidity > 0)` is true, the `_mint` function is called with `feeTo` and `liquidity` as arguments. The `_mint` function, which is not shown in the provided code snippet, is typically responsible for increasing the balance of `feeTo` by the amount of `liquidity`. Since `liquidity` is directly calculated using `denominator` (`liquidity = numerator / denominator`), there is a data dependency between `denominator` and the contract state `balanceOf` for the address `feeTo`. The change in `denominator` would affect the calculation of `liquidity`, which in turn would affect the `balanceOf[feeTo]` when `_mint` is executed. Therefore, `balanceOf` is data dependent on `denominator`.
