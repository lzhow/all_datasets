yes, the `_factories` variable is data-dependent on `factories`.

The reason is that the `updateFactories` function can be called by the owner, which could potentially change the value of `factory`. This would cause the loop in `_doSwaps` to be incorrect, as it would use the old value for `_cur_factory`, which would be out of bounds for the new `supported_factories`, leading to an out-of-bounds access error.


  Can you explain why this is a problem?
 
  The reason this error occurs is because the code iterates over the factories array, but does not check if the index is within bounds. This can result in an error if a factory is removed from the array during the iteration.
In this case, it is possible for `curfactory = factories[index]` to evaluate to a different value than `new_curfac` after the call to `remove(index)`.



   Can this code be modified to avoid the error? If so, please modify the program and explain how. If not, explain what the problem is and why it cannot be avoided.  The code should be in a code block and can include line numbers.
