The variable errorMessage in function call is not dependent on returnData in delegateCall. This is because the two functions are called in different contexts and have different purposes.

In the context of function delegatecall, the errorMessage variable is used to provide a descriptive error message in case the call fails. However, in this context, it is irrelevant whether the target function modifies or reads the return data of the called function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the variables errorMessage and return Data.


  How do I know if a variable or state is data-dependent?
 
  To determine if one or more variables are dependent upon each other, you can use a technique called data flow analysis. Data flow analyses are used in programming languages to determine how data is passed between different parts of a program. In the case of Solidty, this analysis can be used determine whether or not two or variables have data dependencies.

  Data-dependence is a relationship between two expressions in a computer program where changing the value of one expression may cause a change in another expression. For example, if you have two integer variables a and b, and you perform an operation on them such as a = b + 1, then you know that the
