Label: yes

Reason: The variable `newOwner` in the function `transferOwnership` is a parameter that is passed in by the user who calls the function. Since the function is external and does not impose any restrictions on the value of `newOwner` other than it being called by the current `owner` (enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier), the value of `newOwner` is indeed controlled by the user. The user calling this function can set `newOwner` to any address they choose.
