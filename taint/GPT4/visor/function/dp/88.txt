Label: no

Reason: The function `_snapshot` provided in the example does not reference or interact with a contract state named `_allowances`. The function increments `_currentSnapshotId`, retrieves its current value, emits a `Snapshot` event with the current ID, and returns it. Since `_allowances` is not mentioned or used in any way within the `_snapshot` function, there is no data dependency relationship between `_allowances` and any variable within the `_snapshot` function. Therefore, the label is 'no'.
