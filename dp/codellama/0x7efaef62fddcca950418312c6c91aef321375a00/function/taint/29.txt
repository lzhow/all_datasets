  
The variable token  is a state variable in a smart contract. It is set to the address of the first token in an ERC-291 pair. This variable is used to store the token address in order to facilitate the transfer of tokens between the pair and other contracts.

In this case, the ` token` variable  can be considered as controlled  by user because it can only be set by a trusted contract, such as the factory contract that creates the ERCP-1559 pair contract and the owner of that contract can set the value of `toke`n.
