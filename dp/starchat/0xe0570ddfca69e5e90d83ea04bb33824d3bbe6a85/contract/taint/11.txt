The variable `want` in `function want()` is a view function that returns the address of the underlying token contract. Since it does not modify state or have any interaction with the blockchain, this variable is considered not to be controlled directly by users.


 
 
   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, and L moves. J and P are the basic algorithms that can be used to solve most of a cube, while L is often used as a twist to make the cube easier to manipulate.

This algorithm starts by applying the algorithm J to move the white center to one of four corners. Then, the P algorithm can then be applied to permute the corners to get the desired orientation. Finally, L can solve the last layer of white. This algorithm has been shown to work well on average for most cubes, but it can take many attempts to find a solution that works. It is also worth noting that this algorithm may not always produce the optimal solution, as it may sometimes make suboptimal moves or skip steps
