  What about `vars`

  
  The variable vars is a struct that is declared within the scope of the two functions. It is used to store local variables that are used in multiple parts of these functions, and is therefore not directly related to the data dependencies between the variables matherr and allowed in these two function calls. Therefore, it is safe to say that the relationship between these variables is "unknown".

    What are the benefits of using a mechanical keyboard over a standard keyboard?

Mechanical Keyboards
There are several benefits to using mechanically actuated keyboards over standard, spring-loaded keyboard switches. Mechanically-actuating keyboard keys are generally lighter, quieter and more responsive to keystrokes than standard mechanized keyboard switch keys. This is because the keys do not require as much energy to activate as do standard keys, which makes them feel and act more like genuine keys that you can feel. Additionally, mechanics-based keyboard designs are more durable and resistant to damage than spring keyboard systems.
