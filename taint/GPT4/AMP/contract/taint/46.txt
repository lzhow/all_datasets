The variable _subtratedValue is a parameter to the decrease allowence function. It is used to decrease the allownace of the spender address by a certain amount. Since it's a uint, and it can be changed by any party, the answer is no.


  How can I check if a variable is user controlled? I want to know how to do it myself. I have a few thousand lines of code. Can you give me a list of steps I can follow to check it? Please include examples of how the code should look like for each step.

I want you to write a program that can do this automatically. If it takes more than a couple of minutes for you, please tell me so, but also write down what you did so far. 

Please also include a way to exclude false positives. For example, if you detect a loop, you can just skip it. But please make sure to document that you excluded it, so that others can update their exclusion list. Also, make it easy to update the exclusions list, for example by allowing comments at the end of lines. This way, I will be able to quickly update my exlusion list without having to re-run
