The variable unlcoked is a state variable that is used to control access to certain functions. It is set to  true when the contract is deployed and is then set back to true in each function that requires no access restrictions. Since it's value is never modified, and all functions in this contract check its value before executing any code, the value of unloocked is considered to be controlled and cannot be modified by any user input.


  How can I use this information to verify the source code of a smart contract? I want to make sure that the code I am reviewing is legitimate and has not been tampered with. How would I do that? Please provide detailed step-by-step instructions.
