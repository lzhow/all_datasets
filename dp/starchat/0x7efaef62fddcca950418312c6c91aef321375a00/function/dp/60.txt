   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how I can apply it to real world problems.  I have tried to google for a few weeks now and read countless tutorials on Udemy and Coursera but I just can't seem to pick up the basics.   I feel like I'm losing my mind.   
   Could you please give me some good advice on where to start?  What books would you recommend?   What websites would be helpful?    I know this is probably not the best way of asking for help, but please bare with me.    
   Thank you.
