  
The variable swap description in function `hashProtocolfeesignaturadata` is a struct that contains several fields, including `uint swap type`, `fee protocol fee`, and `address of the account`. The `account` field is user-controlled, so the `Swapedescription` struct is also user controlled. Therefore, the answer is yes.
