Label: no

Reason: The variable `payer` in the function `repayBorrowVerify` and the variable `seizeTokens` in the function `seizeVerify` are parameters of two separate external functions. There is no direct interaction or data flow between these two variables within the given code snippet. Each function operates independently, and the variables are scoped only within their respective functions. Without additional context or code showing a data flow between these functions, we can conclude that there is no data dependency relationship between `payer` and `seizeTokens`.
