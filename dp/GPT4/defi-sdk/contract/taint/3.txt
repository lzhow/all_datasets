Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `amountOut` in the function `getAmountsIn` is an input parameter to the function. This value is determined by the caller of the function, which in this case is the `callBytes` function. The `callBytes` function decodes its input parameter `callerCallData`, which is provided by the external caller (user) of the `callBytes` function. Since the user provides the `callerCallData`, which includes the `amountOut` value indirectly, it means that `amountOut` is indeed controlled by the user.
