  
No, the `merkelProof ` variable in depositeWithWhiteList is NOT controlled  by user because it's a parameter of the depositing function.

The `deposteWithWitelis` function is used to deposited tokens into the curve pool, and it requires a `Mekle proof` to verify the whitlisting of a user, but the proof is generated by a trusted oracle and is therefore not under the control of user who is calling the contract.
