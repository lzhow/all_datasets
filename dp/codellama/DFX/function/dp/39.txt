  
The variable _`swapinfo` is not dependent on variable`_nGliq`.

This is because the `_`n`G`li`q variable is only used in a function call to the `getOrigin` function, which is called before the` _ swapInfo variable.
Therefore, the value of` `_ n`GL`i`Q` variable cannot affect the initialization of the _ `swap`info variable, and the two are independent.
