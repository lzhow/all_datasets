   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it. I want to do something useful with it that pays the bills. What should I do? I have heard that the best way is to just start using python, and as long as I keep using it, I'll get better at programming. Is that true? If so, how do I start? And should it be the only thing I focus on, or can I also learn Java or C++ or Javascript or something else? Please help. This is important to me, as my girlfriend is learning to program, but I don't know what to teach her. She's been programming for a few years, so she knows some things, she just doesn't remember them. If I just started teaching her python now, would she be able to follow me and do useful things with python or would it take too long? What do you recommend? Thank you.
