  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `_token` variable is passed as an argument to the `IER2C(_toke). balanceOf()` function, which returns the balance of the token in `_tokens` at the address of `this`. The `balanaceOf` function does not modify the state of `_tokens`. Therefore, `_balances`, which is a contract variable, is not dependent on `amout`.
