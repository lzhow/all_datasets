The contract function ` _ addReservessInternal` is a non-reentrant function that is called by the `mint` function in `CToken.sol`. The purpose of the `_ addReserveInternal ` function is to update the value of `reserveFactorMantisa` and `totalReservableAmount`.

In the case of `_mint`, the amount of reserves to be added is passed as an argument to the`_ addreserveInternal `_ function. This value is then added to ` totalReserverableAmount`, which is used to calculate the exchange rate.
`reservefactorManta` determines the percentage of interest that accumulates in reservse.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship." Could you please explain what that means?





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!
