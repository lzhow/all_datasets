Explanation: The variable `erc1155TokenAddress` in the function `buyJay` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155`. This is because the `amounts` array is passed as an argument to the `buyJayWithERC1155` function, and its values are used within the function to determine the amount to be returned. The `erc1155TokenAddress` array is also passed as an argument to the `buyJayWithERC1155` function, indicating a data dependency between the two variables.
