Label: no

Reason: The variable `lendersGain` in the function `splitRewardExternal` is a return value calculated by the function `splitReward`. It is not directly set by user input but rather determined by the logic within the `splitReward` function, which presumably calculates the rewards based on the state of the contract and possibly other parameters. Since users do not have direct control over the internal calculations or the return values of a function, `lendersGain` is not controlled by the user.
