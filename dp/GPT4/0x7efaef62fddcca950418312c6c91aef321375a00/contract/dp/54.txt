The variable `amount0Out` in the function `swap` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve0` in the same function. This is because `_reserve0` is used in a `require` statement that checks whether `amount0Out` is less than `_reserve0`, which is a condition for the swap to proceed. The relevant line of code is:

```solidity
require(amount0Out < _reserve0 && amount1Out < _reserve1, 'Pancake: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');
```

This line ensures that the amount being transferred out (`amount0Out`) does not exceed the available reserve (`_reserve0`). The dependency is established as the logic of the function relies on the comparison between these two variables to determine if the function should continue execution or revert.
