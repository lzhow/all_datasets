yes, the `upgradetoandcall` function in `uupsupgradeable` is a low level function that allows users to upgrade their contracts to a new version of the contract. This function allows for a more controlled and safe upgrade process compared to the standard upgrade function.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a way to determine if it's user-controlled?

I'm writing a smart contract that will be used by people who are not necessarily experts in programming. I want to make sure that the smart contracts I write are secure and that users understand how to use them securely.
Is there any way for me to be able to tell if variables are user control or not? If so, how would I do that? I'm specifically looking for something that can be done in Solidty. If there's not something built in, can you give me some tips on how I could implement something like that myself? 

Thank you for your help!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain to me like I am 7 years old.  I don't know anything else about it
