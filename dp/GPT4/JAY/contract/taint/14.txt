The variable `from` in the function `onERC1155Received` is controlled by the user. 

Reason: The `from` variable is an input parameter of the function `onERC1155Received` and its value is determined by the caller of the function. Since the function is a callback function for receiving ERC1155 tokens, the value of `from` represents the address of the user who is sending the tokens. Therefore, the user has control over the value of `from`.
