  
The answer is 'Yes'.

In the `liqiduateBorroweAllow` function, the parameter `address ctokenCollteral`, which is a variable, is data-dependent on `uint repaAmount`, another variable in `lquidateborrowVerif`y. This is because the value of `ctokenColltealal ` is used to determine the amount of tokens that can be seized in liquidation.
