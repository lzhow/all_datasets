Reason: The variable `index` in the function `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions` is a local variable that is used to manage the position of a partition within the `_totalPartitions` array. It is used to help remove a partition from the `_totalPartitions` array when the total supply for that partition becomes zero.

On the other hand, the function `allowance` returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`, and it accesses the `_allowedByPartition` mapping using the `defaultPartition`, `_owner`, and `_spender` as keys.

Since `index` is a local variable within the `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions` function, it does not have any scope outside of that function and therefore cannot have a data dependency with the `allowance` function or the `_allowedByPartition` mapping that it accesses. The two variables are completely unrelated and operate in different contexts within the contract.
