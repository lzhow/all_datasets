No. The contract state `compAccrued` is not data dependent on the variable `supplyState` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex`. The reason is that there is no direct assignment or modification of `compAccrued` based on the value of `supplyState` in the function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two.
