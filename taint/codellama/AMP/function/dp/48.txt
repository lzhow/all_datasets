In the `_addtokenToParition` function, the value of `_balanceto` is updated by adding `_valueto`. This means that the data in `_valuet`is used to update the state of the contract.
Similarly, in function`_mints`, the total supply is increased by `_ value` and the same value is passed to the` _ addTokentoPartion`function. This indicates that `_ valuet `is data-dependent on` `_ valueto `in the context of this contract's state.
