Explanation: The variable `liquidity` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the return value of the `mint` function, which is called on the `pair` contract. The value of `liquidity` depends on the internal logic of the `mint` function and is not directly influenced by user input.
