  
No, the ` fixed Side Amount` variable in function  ` call Bytes` is not dependent on ` caller Call Data` because the value of `swap Type` determines whether `getAmountOut` or ` get Amoun In` function is called.

The ` swap Type ` variable is passed as an argument to the  function, and it is used to determine whether to call `GetAmount Out` with `Fixed SideAmount ` or to  call  the` getAmounIn`function with`FixedSide Amout`.
