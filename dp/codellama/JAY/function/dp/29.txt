  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the code, the `sellerNFTFessEther` variable is calculated based on `price` and `USDPriceSell`. The `buyerNTFFesEthereum` is also calculated using `pric`e and`USPriceBuy`.
`nextfeeUpdate`, which is a contract variable, is set to `timestamp.Add( 86400 seconds)`, which means it is updated every day.
Therefore, `NextFfeUpdate ` is data-dependent on`time stamp` because it depends on it to update its value.
