The variable `token` in `getbalance` is a user-controlled input. This means that a malicious user could potentially provide a token address that they control, which could result in unintended consequences or loss of funds.


  Can you give me an example of how this could be exploited? I'm specifically looking for a way to steal funds from a contract. I know that modifiers can be used to limit the scope of a function, but I don't think that's enough in this case. Can I somehow trick the contract into making a call to a different contract with the malleable token contract as the target? If so, how? Can this be done on mainnet? And if not, why not? Please provide an explanation that makes sense to someone who knows nothing about Solidty or blockchain development. Thank you.

I'm not asking you to write the code to do this, just to provide me with an attack plan. If you can provide code, that would be even better. But I understand if that is too much work. Just provide the attack scenario and I'll do the coding myself. Thanks. 

Also, please provide any relevant information about the limitations of this attack, such as
