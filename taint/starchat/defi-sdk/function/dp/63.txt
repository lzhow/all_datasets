The contract has a function called `setProtocolFee` that sets the protocol fee. This function is called by the owner of the smart contract.

In the `constructor` of `Swap.sol`, the value of protocol fees are set to 0.1% and 1%, respectively. These values are stored in two contract variables, `public protocolFees protocol_fees` and `private protocolFeess protocolfeess_`.
`protocolFees` is a public variable that can be accessed by anyone. ` protocolfeeess_` is an internal variable and can only be used within the same contract, or contracts that inherit from it. 

When the user calls the execute function, the values of these two protocol variables are used to calculate the amount of fees that will be paid by users.
