  What is a strategy in this context?





 
  What are the best ways to cook a steak? I have never cooked beef before and I am not very experienced with cooking.

  
  The best way to start cookin' a beast is to get a good grill.  You want to make sure the grate is hot and the pan is nice and warm.   Next you want a big skillet with a lid.    You should also get some onions, carrots, and celery.     Once you have all the ingredients you need you should sear the onion, celary,  and carrot.      Once the vegetables are nice an sear you can move on to the steaks.       You will want 3-4 steakes, each about 1 inch thick.        You can sear each steake on one side and cook it for about a minute.         Once each side of the steeak is nicely browned you will flip it over and sear it on that side for an additional 2-3 minutes.          Once both sides of each steek are nicely cookied you are ready to move
