  
No, the ` index` variable in function `_removeTockenFromParition` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it doesn't have any user input.

The ` _indexPartionsOf` mapping is a private mapping that is only accessible within the contract, and the `_partionsof` array is also a public array that can be accessed by anyone. Therefore, any changes to the array or the mapping will not be controlled directly by a user, but rather by internal logic within  the smart contract.
