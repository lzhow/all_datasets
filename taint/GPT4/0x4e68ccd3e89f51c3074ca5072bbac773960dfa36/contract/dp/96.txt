Label: no

Reason: The variable `liquidity` in the `write` function is used as an argument to the `transform` function, which calculates a new `Observation` struct. The variable `cardinality` is used to determine the updated index and cardinality but does not influence the calculation of any of the fields within the `Observation` struct returned by `transform`. The `liquidity` variable is used independently of `cardinality` for the calculations within `transform`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `liquidity` and `cardinality` within the `write` function.
