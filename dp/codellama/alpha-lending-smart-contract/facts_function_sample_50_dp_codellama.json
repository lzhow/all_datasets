The valueof `to block `is also updated to be the lesser of ` to block and next block`. The loop continues until `totamount `reaches the total amount of tokens that have been released.

For each element, it retrieves the corresponding `Pool` object from the mapping `pools` using the address of each `ERC-2`0 token as the key. It then calls the internal function`getuserPooldata` to retrieve the liquid balance and borrow balance of a user in a specific pool, and checks if the user has any liquid or borrowed balance in that pool by comparing the retrieved values with  `0`. If the balance is not ` \u200b\u200b0`, it calculates the total liquid and total borrow balances of all pooled assets for the given user.\n  The `if` statement checks whether the collate percent is greater than 1 and whether user use pool as collatoral. If so, It calculats the compound liquid balace and adds it to the  total collated balance base.  It also calculatesthe compunded borrowbalance and add it tot the totla borrow base balance.   The function returns the calculated values. In the second function , it does the same thing as in first one. So, ` compondedLiquefitybalace` is data depend on ` totalcollatedbalancbase` because it is used to calculate the value of `totalliqueditybase`."

You analyze the Solidity contract code and classify if two variables or contract states have a data dependency relationship. The labels you use are 'yes', 'no' and 'unknown'. 'yes' means they are data dependent. 'no' means they are not data dependent. Otherwise, they are labelled 'unknown'. You first give the label and then explain the reason. There is one example.",
            "The code is \n ```\n function calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmount ( ERC20 _token , uint256 _amount ) internal view returns (uint256) {    Pool storage pool = pools[address(_token)];    if (pool.totalBorrowShares == 0) {      return 0;    }    return _amount.mul(pool.totalBorrowShares).div(pool.totalBorrows);  }\nfunction repayInternal ( ERC20 _token , uint256 _share ) internal {    Pool storage pool = pools[address(_token)];    UserPoolData storage userData = userPoolData[msg.sender][address(_token)];    require(      pool.status == PoolStatus.ACTIVE || pool.status == PoolStatus.CLOSED,      \"can't repay to this pool\"    );    uint256 paybackShares = _share;    if (paybackShares > userData.borrowShares) {      paybackShares = userData.borrowShares;    }    claimCurrentAlphaReward(_token, msg.sender);    uint256 paybackAmount = calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount(_token, paybackShares);    pool.totalBorrows = pool.totalBorrows.sub(paybackAmount);    pool.totalBorrowShares = pool.totalBorrowShares.sub(paybackShares);    userData.borrowShares = userData.borrowShares.sub(paybackShares);    _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), paybackAmount);    emit Repay(address(_token), msg.sender, paybackShares, paybackAmount);  } \n``` . \n You first give the label and then explain the reason. Please answer the following question: is the variable `_token`  in the function calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmount data depended on the variable `paybackAmount` in the function `repayInternal`?"

The `Pool` storage variable is also used in this function.\nOn the other hand, in ` repaYInternal()` the`_share` variable and the  `userData` are used.  The`payBackShars` is calculated using the same `_share`.\nTherefore, `_ token` depends on ` payBackAmount`."
