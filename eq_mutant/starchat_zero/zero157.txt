Both codes provide the exact same functionality. They are both valid implementations of the Profits class in Java or C, meaning that given some input, they will output the correct result. The only difference between the codes is the use of `abs` function in line 41. While the original code uses the built-in `Math.abs()` function, the mutated code instead uses a custom `profit.Abs()` method that essentially does the **same** thing, except for a **slightly different edge case**. This slight difference, which would never occur in a normal use case, makes the code behave differently, but in both cases it provides the expected result when given an input `i`.
