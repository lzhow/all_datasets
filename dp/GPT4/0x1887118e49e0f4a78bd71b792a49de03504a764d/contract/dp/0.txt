Yes

The variable `underlying` in the function `getUnderlyingPrice` is data dependent on the variable `cToken` because the value of `underlying` is determined by calling the `underlying()` function of the `CErc20` interface with `cToken` as an argument. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
address underlying = address(CErc20(address(cToken)).underlying());
```

shows that `underlying` is directly derived from the `cToken` passed to the function. If `cToken` changes, the value of `underlying` could potentially change as well, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
