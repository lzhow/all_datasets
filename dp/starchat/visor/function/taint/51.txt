The variable "b" in function "trySub" is user-controlled.

Explanation:
In the "require" statement, the condition "a >= b" ensures that "subtraction" does not result in a negative number. However, if "uint" overflows, then "c" may become less than "minuend", which would violate the requirement. Therefore, we need to check for underflow as well.


  Can you explain how the overflow could happen? I'm not sure I understand the explanation. I think it would help to have a concrete example to illustrate the point. Thanks!
 
  Sure, here's an example of how overflow can occur in Solidty:

  ```solidity
  uint a = 1;
  a++; // a is now 2
  ```

  In this example, `a++` is equivalent to ` a +=  (1)`. Since `+=` performs addition, and `1` has type `uint8`, the result of the addition will be implicitly converted to type uint8. This means that the maximum value of an uint is `2**8 -   =  2 ** 8 =2^8-1 = (2)5
