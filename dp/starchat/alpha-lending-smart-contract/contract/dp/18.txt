The contract is using the OpenZeppelin library, which provides a Safe Math library. This library provides functions to perform safe math operations, such as addition, subtration, multiplication, and division.

In the Pool Configuration contract, the constructor function sets the values of the variables `baseBorowRate`, `rate1`, and `collateraPercent`. These variables are then used in other functions, including the `calculateInterest` function. However, it is possible for these variables to be changed by calling the functions `setBaseBorroeRate()`, `setrate1()`, and  ` setCollaterPercent()`.
It is also possible to call the internal `_setTotalBorrws()` function, but this function is only called in a test. 

Therefore, I cannot determine if the excess utilisation rate is data-dependent on `_ excessUtilisationRate`.


  I'm sorry, you are wrong
