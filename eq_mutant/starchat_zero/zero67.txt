The two provided codes snippets are **not semantic equivalent**. While the first snippet may produce the correct result under some inputs, it may result in an infinite loop or incorrect output for others. In the case of the second snippet, even if it correctly computed the square root of a given number, if that number is negative, the returned value will be NaN.

Considering that the meaning and purpose of both code snippets is to find the **square root** of an input number within a certain tolerance, they can be considered semanticALLY equal, meaning that, given identical inputs (i.e., the input value to the `sqrt()` function), they will produce identical outputs.
