  
No, the `` variable in function `` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be modified by any external user or function.

The `` function in this contract is a pure function, which means that it does not modify the state of the contract. It only takes in parameters and returns a value without modifying the storage of this smart contract or any other contracts. Therefore, any variables declared within this function are not accessible from outside the scope of that function and are therefore not considered controlled variables.
