  
No, the variables `_before` and `_pool` are independent of each other.

The variable`_before `is assigned the value of the `bal` variable, which is calculated by calling the`balan`ce function of`w`ant. This function returns the balance of `wat`in the contract. Therefore,` _befor`e` is dependent on` wat`er. However, ` _poo`l is assigned a value that is independent from` w`at. It is a constant value set in` con`structor.  Therefore` `_po`ol`is not dependent`on` `wa`ter.
