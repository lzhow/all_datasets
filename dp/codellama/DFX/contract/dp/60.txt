  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `delegate` function, the `_calle` variable is passed as an argument to the delegatecall function. This means that the value of `_call` is determined by the caller of the contract. In this case, it is `Assimbators.viewNumerairBalanc`e.
Since the data is dependent on `_assimb` and `_amt`, the output of `viewnumerairbalance` will be dependent of data. Therefore, `_dest`is data-dependent on ` data`.
