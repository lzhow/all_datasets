The function `transfer` is a method of the `ERC1400Raw` token contract, which is an implementation of a standard called ERC-1844, or more specifically, ERC1967.

In the context of ERC20 tokens, the `_from` parameter represents the address of an account sending tokens. In the case of `SmartToken`, the token is sent from the contract itself, so the value of `_operator` would be the same as `_sender`.
However, in this case, `_transferFrom` does not have the parameter `_data`, which means that the data parameter is set to the empty string. This means the partition is not specified in any way, and the default partition will be used.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "partition is specified".
 
  In this context, "specified" means "given". In other words, you are asking if the "_partition" parameter in `_removeTokensFromPartitions` function is data-dependent on "_to" in `addTokensToPartitions`.
