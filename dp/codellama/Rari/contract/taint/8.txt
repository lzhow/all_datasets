In the `dip` function, the local variable token is assigned the value of the public variable 'token' in line 10, which is a reference to an Ethereum token contract.

Therefore, token _ is considered to be controlled  by a third party, not the owner of  the Reservitory contract and is labeled as 'NO'.
