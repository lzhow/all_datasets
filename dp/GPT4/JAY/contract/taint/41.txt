The variable `_` in the function `onERC1155Received` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `_` is not used or modified within the function. It is only used as a placeholder for the return value of the function `IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155Received.selector`, which is a predefined value and does not depend on user input. Therefore, the variable `_` is not controlled by the user.
