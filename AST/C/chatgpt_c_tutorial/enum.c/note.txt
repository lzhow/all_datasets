The AST is represented as a JSON object. The top-level object has a type attribute with the value "translation_unit". The value attribute is an array that contains three objects, one for each top-level construct in the code file.

The first object represents a preprocessor directive. Its type attribute is "preprocessor", and its value attribute is the preprocessor directive string.

The second object represents an enum declaration. Its type attribute is "enum_declaration", and its value attribute is an object that contains the name of the enum and an array of enumerator objects. Each enumerator object has a type attribute of "enumerator" and a value attribute that contains the name of the enumerator.

The third object represents the function main. Its type attribute is "function_definition", and its value attribute is an object that contains the return type, name, parameters, and body of the function. The return type is represented as a type_specifier object with a type attribute of "type_specifier" and a value attribute of "int". The name of the function is represented as a string. The parameters of the function are null because main takes no arguments. The body of the function is represented as a compound_statement object with a type attribute of "compound_statement" and a value attribute that is an array of statements.

The statements array contains three statements. The first statement is a declaration statement that declares a variable m of type enum Le and initializes it to the enumerator M. The declaration
