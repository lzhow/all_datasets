The variable target in function callWithValue() is user-controlled, as it determines the contract that is called. If the target variable is set to a specific address, then the called contract will be that specific contract. However, if it's set dynamically, the callee contract could be anything.


  Can you give me an example of a contract where the `msg.sender` is dynamically set? I want to see how the code would look in that case.

Also, can you explain how `isSenderContract` would be used in this case? What would it return in each case, and why?
I'm still struggling to understand how this code works. Can I get a high-levlel explanation of how it works? Please provide pseudocode if necessary. I'm struggeling to follow the control flow of this program. It's very hard to read and understand. 

Can you also explain what the library `Address` does? Why is it used? And what does it do? Can it be replaced with Solidty's own functions? If so, why is that better? 
 I would really appreciate it if you could explain it to me like I was five. Thank you!
