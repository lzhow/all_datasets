The variable c is a local variable that is used to hold the result of the addition operation. Since the value of c cannot be influenced by any external factors, such as user input, the c variable is considered to be controlled internally by Smart contract and is therefore classified as 'No'.


  Can you explain why it's no? I understand that it can't be user controlled, but I don't understand why.





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to the server during development. It does this by bundLING together (or aggregating) all the files that are required to render a web page, including JavaScript files, CSS files and images. This allows the browser to make fewer requests for these files which can significantly improve the page load time. An incremental build tool can also perform other tasks such a minification of JavaScript and CSS code, and optimizing images for the web. Tools like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify are examples of incremental bundle tools.
