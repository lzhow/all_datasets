The function update borrow alpha reward has two parameters, the first is a storage pointer to the pool struct, and the second is an unsigned integer representing the amount of alpha rewards to be added to that pool's total alpha token reward.

In the body of the updateborrowalphareward function, we first add the value of _ amount to pool->totalalphatokenreward. This is done by calling the add function on pool -> totalalphatokreward, which is of type uint116. 

Next, if the condition _ pool-totalborrowshares ==0 is true, then we return from the current function without modifying any other variables. We can deduce that this condition will always be false, as the totalborrowshare variable is always initialized to a non-zero value before it is used in any calculations. Therefore, it can be assumed that the _totalborrowshares variable will never be equal to zero.


  Can you explain how the code works?
