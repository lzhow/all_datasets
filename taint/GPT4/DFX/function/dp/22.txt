Explanation: The variable `_oGLiq` in the function `viewTargetSwap` is data dependent on the variable `nGLiq_` in the function `viewTargetSwapData`. This can be observed from the line `oGLiq_ += oBals_[i];` in the `viewTargetSwapData` function, where the value of `oGLiq_` is updated based on the value of `oBals_[i]`. The value of `oBals_[i]` is determined by the value of `nBals_[i]`, which in turn depends on the value of `nGLiq_`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_oGLiq` and `nGLiq_`.
