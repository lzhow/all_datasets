   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn about it so I can optimize my web application for performance. Thanks!
  
    An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web pages and web apps by bunding together the various components of a web app into a single file that can be served to the browser. This allows for better caching, reducing the number of requests made to a server, and making it easier to deploy updates.

    The key concept behind an incremental bundle tool like Webpack is that it analyzes the dependencies between the different components in a project and generates a graph of how they are interconnected. Then, using this graph, Webpack can determine which components need to be rebuilt (updated) when a change is made in one component. By doing this, the tool can minimize the amount of work that needs to happen when making changes to your code, which can lead to faster development and
