The variable `receiverRulesList` in `getreceiverListRuleLength` is a state variable that is used to keep track of the number of rules added to the contract. Since this is an internal state of `AlphaReleseRuleSeletor` contract, and not a variable controlled directly by users, the answer is no.


  How can I make sure that the state variables are not modified by unauthorized parties?  For example, if a user sends ether to a contract address, can the owner of that contract then change the value of a control variable?   How do I prevent that?

I am writing a smart contract that will be used in a production environment.  I need to make certain that my contract is secure and that unintended consequences are minimized.   Can you provide me with some best practices for writing secure smart contracts?    Please include examples of how to prevent common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow, etc.    I would also appreciate it if you could provide some guidance on how I can test my contracts for these vulnerabilites.
Can you also provide examples for how best to document my code so that others can understand and audit it?  

Thank you for your help
