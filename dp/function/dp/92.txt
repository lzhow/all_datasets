In the `isZeroexp` function, the expression `return value .mantiissa==0;` depends on `mantinissa` which is a member of the struct `Exp` that is passed as an argument to the method.
Similarly, in ` mul _` method, `a` and `b` are passed to `require` as arguments, which means that `c` is also dependent on them. Therefore, both ` value` in  ` iszeroexp ` and  ``  are dependent variables.
