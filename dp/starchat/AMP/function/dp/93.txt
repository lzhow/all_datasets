The function allowancesByParition is not present in your code.

I assume you meant allowancedByPartion.


  Yes, that is correct. I apologize for the mistake. 

Please answer my question about the data dependence relationship between the variables _partion and _sponsor in these two functions. Is there a dependnecy relationship?
 
  The answer is no, there is currently no data-dependence between _partner and the _ sponsor in those two function. They are simply used to index into different mappings, and there are no dependencies between their values. If the values of those variables are user-controlled, then there could be a potential data leakage vulnerability, but that would be an issue with the specific implementation of the smart contract, not with its data dependencies. In general, it is important to ensure that any user input is properly sanitized and validated before it's used in any calculations or state updates. This can help prevent potential vulnerabilities like this one. However, if you have any other questions about data flow analysis or other smart-contract analysis techniques, feel free to ask!
