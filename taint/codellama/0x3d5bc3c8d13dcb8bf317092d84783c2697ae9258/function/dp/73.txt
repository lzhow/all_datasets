  
No, the variables ` spende` and ` allowed` are independent.

The variable` spen` is a parameter of the `allowance` function, which is not used in any way in ` liquidatBorro`wFres`h`.
On the other hand, `allowe`d is defined within the scope of `liq`uidate`B`orrow`F`resh`and is used to determine the return value of`allow`ance. However, this variable is only used within this function and is never passed as an argument to any other function. Therefore, it is independent of any external state and cannot be considered a dependency.
