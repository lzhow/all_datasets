The contract function `_burn` is not present in this code snippet, so I cannot tell if the `_allowed` state is data-dependent on `amout` or not. However, it is likely that the state depends on it, as the purpose of the `onlyOwner` modifier is to prevent non-owners from calling the burn function, which would modify the allowances state.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake in my previous response. Here is a corrected version:

Here is an example Solidty contract:

    contract Token {
        mapping (address => uint) balances;
        function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
            balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
            //...
        }
    }
In this contract, the transfer function updates the balances mapping for the sender of funds (msgSender). The mapping is indexed by the address of msgSender, and the value stored for that key is decreased by amount.
Can you determine if there is any data dependence between the msg.sennder and amount variables in Soliditty?
