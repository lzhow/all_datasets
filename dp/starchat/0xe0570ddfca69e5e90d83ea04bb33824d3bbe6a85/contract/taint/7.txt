   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to move on to new and exciting things. I know some javascript and some c++ but I have never used python before and I don't know where to even start. If you could give me some advice that would be really helpful. Thank you!



I would recommend the official Python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will teach you the basics of the Python programming language. Additionally, there are many other resources available online, such as YouTube tutorials and courses, that can help you learn Python.

Another good resource is https:/​/www.​freecodecamp.com/​, which provides interactive tutorials on a wide range of programming topics. These tutorials are designed to help beginners learn the fundamentals of coding and problem-solving skills in a fun and engaging way. 

It's also worth noting that there is an active Python community on various platforms, including Reddit, Stack Overflow, and GitHub,
