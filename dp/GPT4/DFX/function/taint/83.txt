Explanation: The variable `i` in the function `getGrossLiquidityAndBalancesForDeposit` is not controlled by the user. It is used as a loop counter in a for loop to iterate over the assets array. The value of `i` is determined by the length of the assets array, which is controlled by the contract code and not by the user. Therefore, the variable `i` is not controlled by the user.
