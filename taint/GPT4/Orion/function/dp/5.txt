Explanation: The variable `amountOut` in the function `getAmountOutUv2` is data dependent on the variable `amountIn` in the same function. This is because the value of `amountIn` is used to calculate the value of `amountOut` through the equations `amountInWithFee = amountIn.mul(997)` and `amountOut = numerator / denominator`, where `numerator` and `denominator` are dependent on `amountIn`. Therefore, any change in the value of `amountIn` will affect the value of `amountOut`.
