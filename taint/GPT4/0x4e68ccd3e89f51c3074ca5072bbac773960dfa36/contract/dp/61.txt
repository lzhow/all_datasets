The variable `liquidity` in the function `write` is data dependent on the variable `self` in the function `getSurroundingObservations` because `liquidity` is passed as an argument to the `transform` function within `write`, and the result of `transform` is used to update the state of `self`. Then, `self` is used in `getSurroundingObservations` to retrieve and manipulate observations based on the updated state that includes the effects of the `liquidity` parameter. The dependency chain is as follows: `liquidity` affects the state of `self` through `transform` in `write`, and `self` is then used in `getSurroundingObservations`, making them data dependent.
