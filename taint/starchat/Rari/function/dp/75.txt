The contract function `setWhiteListStatuses` is a private function that is called by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that the only way to call this function is if the current contract has been granted ownership by its owner, which is typically done in a constructor.

As such, the state variable that this contract depends on is `owner`, which represents the address of the owner of this smart contract. Since the `_owner` variable is not modified by this private method, it is considered to be a constant, and therefore does not have any data dependencies on any other variables.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependencies" in this context. Could you please explain what a "Data Dependency" is in relation to this question?
 
  Data dependencies are relationships between variables that are based on how the data is used. In the context of smart contracts, data can be represented as variables, functions, or other data structures. Data dependency relationships are created when one variable or data structure is dependent on another variable, function, etc. that it references. For example, if a function accesses a global variable and that variable changes, then the dependent function will also need to change in order to reflect
