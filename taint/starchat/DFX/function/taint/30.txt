Yes, the `curve_` variable in `viewProportionDeposit` is user-controlled. This is because the value of `cure_` is derived from the input `_deposit`, which is provided by a user, and is used to calculate the output values.

  What is a good way to test this?  I want to make sure that I am not missing any edge cases.  Can you provide a few simple test cases?   I can then use those test to verify that my tool is working correctly.   Please provide those simple tests as a list of Solidty code.
