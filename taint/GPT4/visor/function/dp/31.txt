Reason: The variable `snapshotted` in the function `balanceOfAt` is directly assigned the value returned from the function `_valueAt`, which in turn uses the variable `snapshots` to determine the return value. Specifically, the `snapshotted` variable is set based on whether a snapshot at the given `snapshotId` exists within the `snapshots` data structure. If the `snapshotId` is found within `snapshots.ids`, then `snapshotted` is set to `true`, and the corresponding value from `snapshots.values` is returned. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `snapshotted` and `snapshots` because the value of `snapshotted` is determined by the state and contents of `snapshots`.
