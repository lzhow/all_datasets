Label: no

Reason: The variable `amountInWithFee` in the function `getAmountOut` is not data dependent on the variable `numerator` within the same function. The `amountInWithFee` is calculated first and is then used to calculate `numerator`. The dependency flows from `amountInWithFee` to `numerator`, not the other way around. Therefore, `numerator` does not influence the value of `amountInWithFee`, and there is no data dependency from `numerator` to `amountInWithFee`.
