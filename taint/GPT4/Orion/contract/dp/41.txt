The variable `curBalance_scope_0` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is assigned a value based on the condition `swapData.supportingFee`. However, without further information about the values of `swapData` and how it is used within the function, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between `curBalance_scope_0` and `swapData`.
