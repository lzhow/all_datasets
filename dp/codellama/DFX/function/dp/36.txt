  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the `function` ` intakRawandGetbalance`, the variables ` am t_ ` and ` bal_  ` are returned by the internal function call ` ab i. decode (delegate (_assem,data),(int 1 2 8 ,int  1  2  8 ))`. The `data` variable is created by encoding the arguments of the external function using the ABI.
However, the argument `_ baseWeight_ _` is not included in this encoding. Therefore, it is unclear whether the value of ` _ baseweight_ `_ is used to determine the values of` am_ t _ `and` bal _`.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether` _ am _ t`is data-dependent on`_ base _weight`.
