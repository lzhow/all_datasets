The variable typehash is used to create the domain separator. This is a fixed value that is determined by Solidty and cannot be changed by users. Therefore, the type hash is considered to be controlled internally by Smart contract developers and is therefore labeled as "no".


  Can you explain why it's not "yes"?
  
  The type_hash variable is part of the Eip721 standard, which is an interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The EIp77 standard specifies that the value of type _ hash must be fixed for all NFTs of a particular type. Since the hash value is fixed, there is no need for the contract to accept user input.
