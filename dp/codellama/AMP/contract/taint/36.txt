  
The variable _ partition in function_ approbeBy Partion is labeled as ' yes'. The reason is that the _ approval function in solidty contracts is used to approves the transfer of tokens on behalf of the owner. This function takes in three parameters: the address of token holder, the spender address, and the amount of approving tokens. Therefore, this function can be used by a user to allow another address to spend tokens from their account.

In the given code, there is a function called _appoveByParition which takes three arguments: _parition , _ tokenHolder and _ spendee.  The _ parition variable is passed as an argument to the approbation function. It is possible that a malicious user could pass a partition that they control to this approbal function, allowing them to control the tokens of another user in that partition. Thus, we can conclude that _ partiton is user controlled.
