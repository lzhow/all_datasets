  
No, the ` token` variable in function `callBytes` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is assigned a value based on the input parameters of the contract.

The `pragmas` and `import` statements are used to import external libraries and interfaces, and the constructor is used for initializing the state of a contract, but the local variables in a function are not directly controlled or modified by users.
