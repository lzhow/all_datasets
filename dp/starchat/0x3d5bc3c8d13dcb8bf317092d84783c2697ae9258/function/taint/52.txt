The variable a in function `fraction` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a can be influenced by other variables and parameters in a contract, which may be controlled indirectly by users.

To determine if a variable or parameter is directly controlled or influences other values, you can use a combination of static analysis and manual review. For example, if you are analyzing a smart contract that handles cryptocurrencies, a user may provide a value for the `rate` parameter of the fraction function. In this case, ` rate` would be indirect control over the other parameters of ` fraction`.
In general, to determine the control flow of variables or parameters, one should consider the entire contract and its interactions with other parts of code.


  How can I determine indirect user control?  What are some common ways to do this?
Can you give me an example of how to use static code analysis to identify indirect input control in Solidty? I would like to know how I can do that.  Can you also give an explanation of what static and dynamic code analyses are? Can I use both? How do they work? Please provide examples. I am a beginner and would appreciate a detailed
