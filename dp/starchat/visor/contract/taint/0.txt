The variable _ vis r in this function does not appear to be user-controlled. It is a constant address that is used to instantiate the IVISr and vVisr variables, and it does appear that these variables are not user controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user or not? I mean, I can look at the code, but I'm not sure if that's enough. Can you give me some tips?

Also, can you explain to me what is "user-control"?
