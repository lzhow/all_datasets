  
No, the data dependence relationship between the two is not clear.

The function "_maint" is a function that adds a new token to the total supply of the token. It takes in a parameter "_value" which is an amount of tokens to be added to total Supply, and it also takes a variable "_operator" that is used to determine the address of who is minting the tokens.  The function uses the "_total Suppy" variable to keep track of how many tokens are in circulation. However, it does not use the value of "_Value" in any way to update the state of _TotalSuppy. Therefore, there is no data dependance relationship established between _Value and _ TotalSuppply.
