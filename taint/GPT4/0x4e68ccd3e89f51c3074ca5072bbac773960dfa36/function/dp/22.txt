Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `increaseObservationCardinalityNext`, the variable `observationCardinalityNextNew` is assigned the result of the function call `observations.grow(observationCardinalityNextOld, observationCardinalityNext)`. Since `observationCardinalityNextOld` is passed as an argument to this function, the value of `observationCardinalityNextNew` directly depends on the value of `observationCardinalityNextOld`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `observationCardinalityNextNew` and `observationCardinalityNextOld`.
