  
No, the ` amounts` variable in function `buyerc 75` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be modified by external users.

The ` amount` array is passed as an argument to the  ` buyerc 51` function, and the values in this array are set by calling the` safeTranserFrom` method on the ERc-1 45 contract. This method is called by internal functions, such as ` buyer c 81`, and these functions are only called from within the contract itself, so the value of the amounts array cannot be changed by an external user through the public interface of this contract .
