Explanation: 
Based on the given code snippet, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `amount` in the function `getAmountOutCurve` and the variable `path` in the function `getAmountsOut`. The two variables are used in separate functions and there is no direct assignment or usage of one variable based on the value of the other variable. Therefore, the data dependency between `amount` and `path` is unknown.
