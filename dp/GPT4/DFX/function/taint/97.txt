Explanation: The variable `i` in the function `viewProportionalWithdraw` is not controlled by the user. It is a loop counter that is used internally within the function to iterate over the assets array. The value of `i` is determined by the length of the assets array, which is controlled by the contract itself. Therefore, the user does not have control over the value of `i`.
