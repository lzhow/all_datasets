  
No, the variables `w` and `strateg` are independent of each other.

The variable `_wants` is a local variable in function `_withDraw` that is initialized to `IStratagy(Strategy).wanted()`. This variable is only used within the scope of the `_Withdraw` function and is never modified or accessed outside of this function. Therefore, it is independent from any other variable.
