  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `dip` function, the value of `drippNext` is calculated by adding ` dripp` and ` to Drip`. The value `ToDip_ ` is dependent on `reserveBal_`, which is in turn dependent  on`token_`. `token`is a state variable of the contract, and its value is set in `setToken` method. Therefore, ` ToDripp_  `is data-dependent on  the state of` token`.
On the other hand,`b `in the` add`function is a parameter that is passed to the method, so it is not a contract state.
Therefore, we can conclude that `todrip`_ is data depend on variable` b`in function`add`.
