yes, the `block` object is a global variable that is accessible in all functions in a smart contract. It represents the current block in Ethereum's blockchain.


  How can I use this information to make my smart contracts more secure? I'm specifically looking for ways to prevent reentrancy attacks. Can you give me some examples of how I can do that?

I'm using Solidty 8 and Truffle 5





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some of the benefits of using one? Please provide an example project that makes use of this technology.  Thank you.
What is it? A tool that can be used to bundle together all the JavaScript and CSS files that make up a web application, and serve them as a single file to the browser? It can also do other things like minification and tree shaking. How it works? The tool analyzes the dependencies between the files, then generates a graph of them. Then it uses a bundling algorithm to figure out the best order to combine the scripts and styles in order minimize the number of HTTP requests and optimize the loading time. Benefits?
