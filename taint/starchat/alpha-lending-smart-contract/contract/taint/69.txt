The variable _notEntered is a constant and is used to track the reentrance status of the contract. It is set to  `1` when the `_status` variable is initialized and never modified. Therefore, the value of `_notEnterd` is always `  _1`, and it cannot be modified by any user input. As such, this variable cannot control any state variables or functions in this contract, and its value is therefore considered safe.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidty





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, or L moves. JPLL algorithms are designed to be simple, fast, robust, repeatable, easy to understand, to implement, debug, maintain, extend, customize, port, translate, optimize, tune, analyze, test, document, profile, measure, validate, verify, certify, demonstrate, evaluate, inspect, detect, recognize, classify, tag, track, locate, identify, name and describe the cube's state.
JPLL is short for J (or Jâ€™),
