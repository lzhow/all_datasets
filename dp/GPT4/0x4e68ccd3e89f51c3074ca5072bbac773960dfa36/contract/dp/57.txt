Label: no

Reason: The variable `add` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` is a boolean parameter that determines the direction of the price movement (whether to add or subtract the amount from the current price). On the other hand, the variable `sqrtRatioBX96` in the function `getAmount0Delta` represents a square root price and is used to calculate the amount of token0 that corresponds to a given liquidity and price range.

There is no direct data dependency between `add` and `sqrtRatioBX96` because they are used in separate functions for different purposes and calculations. The value of `add` does not influence the value of `sqrtRatioBX96`, nor does `sqrtRatioBX96` influence the value of `add`. They are independent parameters passed into their respective functions, and there is no code in the provided snippet that creates a dependency between them.
