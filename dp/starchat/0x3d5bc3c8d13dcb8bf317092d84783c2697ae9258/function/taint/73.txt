The variable `a` in `greaterThan(A, B)` is a user-controlled input. It is used to compare two exponential numbers, `A` and `B`, and determine if `|A| > |B|`.

In the `Exponential` contract, the exponential type is defined as:
`struct Exp{ uint  mantisa; }`
where `mantssa` represents the mantiass of the number in units of `10^17`. The `getExp` function takes two inputs `num` (the numenator) and  `denom`  (denominator) to create a new `Exp struct`. This function first multiplies `n` by `expscale` to scale the nummber to the same scale as the other exponentials in this contract. Then, this function calls `divUInt` on the scaled nummerator and the denominator to get the ration. Finally, we return the new Exp struct with the calculated rantional mantaiss.
This function does not modify any state variables or have any other side effects. Therefore, all variables in Exp are considered user controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having
