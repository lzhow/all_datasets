The contract variable `_balances` is data-dependent on `msgSender` and `spender` because it is updated in two places:

- In the `approve` function, when `allowance` for a given `owner` - ` spender ` pair is set to a new value.
`balances[msgsender][spenders] = value`
This line updates the `_balance` of the sender by the amount of tokens that the sponsorship is approved for. 

In the same function: 
 `balances[_from] -= _value`  and  ` balances[_to] += _values` are called. These lines update the balances of both the owners.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are found?
