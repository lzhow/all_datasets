Label: no

Reason: The variable `_NOT_ENTERED` is a private constant within the `ReentrancyGuard` contract. It is set to a fixed value of `1` and cannot be changed after the contract is deployed. Since it is a constant, its value is set at compile time and not modifiable at runtime, and because it is private, it cannot be accessed or modified by external users or contracts. Therefore, `_NOT_ENTERED` is not controlled by the user.
