  
No, the `contract state sellnFtFfeEht` is not dependent on `variable price` because the value of ` price ` is calculated using the current price feed, which is stored in a separate contract. Therefore, ` sellNFtFeEh` can be updated independently of the price.

The ` updateFess` function calculates the new value for ` selnFtfFeh ` based on a different source of data, namely the latest price from the external price oracle. This means that the two values are independent and do not have any direct relationship with each other.
