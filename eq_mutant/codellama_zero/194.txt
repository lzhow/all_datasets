`no`, the codes do not have same outputs. In the original code, `bonu4` will be calculated by `(i - 4 * 50 *0 + 6 *5* 7.5 +4*5 *3)` which is `12570`. However, in the mutant code `i` has been increased by  `4`, so the calculation will become `(1 + i -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -0 -3)`, which will result in `0`
