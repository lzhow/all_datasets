  
No, the `Data` variable in `decodeBytes` is a struct that is defined in a library, and it does not have any user-controlled inputs. Therefore, `yes`

The `OBI` library defines a `struct Data` that contains two fields: `offset` and `raw`. The `from` function initializes a new `Dat` object with the given `bytes` data and sets the offset to  `0`.
 The other functions in this library are modifiers that shift the data offset by a given number of bytes. These functions are used to decode various data types from the raw bytes data in an efficient way.
  The variable data is passed as an argument to the decode functions, but it's not user controlled. It' s a local variable that'S defined inside the library.
