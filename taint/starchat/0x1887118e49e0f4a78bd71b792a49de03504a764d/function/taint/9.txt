The variable `underlying` in `function price` is user-controlled. It is passed into the `oracles` mapping, which is a user input, and can be modified by calling `add` with a new key-value pair.


  Can you explain how the attacker can exploit this? Please give an example of how an attacker could use this to steal funds.

Please provide detailed steps for an attack scenario. For example:
1. Attacker deploys contract with exploit code. 
2....
3. Exploit code steals all funds from victim contract.


I want you to provide clear and detailed instructions for the attack. I want a step-by-step explanation of the exploit and how to execute it. This should include code examples and screenshots where necessary. If there are any preconditions or limitations to the scenario, please include those as well. 


Thank you for your help!
