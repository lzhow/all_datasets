The variable `_nGLiq` in the function `viewOriginSwapData` is not directly dependent on the variable `_originAmount` in the function `viewOriginSwap`. The value of `_nGLiq` is calculated based on the values of `_length`, `nBals_`, `oBals_`, and `nGLiq_`, which are not directly related to `_originAmount`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
