In the given code, the `SaferMath` library is defined, which contains several functions for performing arithmetic operations with safety checks. However, there is no direct relationship between the variables ` a` and ` b` used in ` try Add` function and the ones used `in try Mod`function.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the two are dependent on each other.
