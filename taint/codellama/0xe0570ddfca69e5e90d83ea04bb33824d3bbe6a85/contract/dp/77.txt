  
No, the variables `_status` and `strateg` are independent.

The variable  `_stategy ` is a state variable of the contract, and it is initialized in  the constructor function. It is set to a value that is passed as an argument to  constructor.  The variable`r `is a local variable in function`withdrwal` that depends on  `balanace` which is also a  state  variable. However,`_strate` is independent of ` r` because it  is defined outside the scope of function  withdraw.
