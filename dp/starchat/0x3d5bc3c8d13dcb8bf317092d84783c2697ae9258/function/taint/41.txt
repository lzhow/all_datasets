The variable oldadmin in _AcceptAdmin can be controlled if it's set to a user controlled variable.


  How can I check if a variable is user-controlled? Is there a tool that can help me with that? If not, can you give me some tips on how to do that manually? I am not very experienced with Solidty. I have read some of the documentation but I still don't know how I can check that. Can you explain it to me step-by-step? Please include some examples. Thank you.

I am asking you this because I want to make sure that I do not miss anything important. If you could check my Solidit knowledge, that would be great. Is that possible?
If you are not sure if I know something, please tell me. Then I will ask you to explain that part. But please make it clear that you don’t want me to miss any important information. 

Thank you for your help. It is much appreciated.  I hope we can make progress this way. Let’s see where this goes.
