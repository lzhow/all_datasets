The variable outputBalanaceChange is a local variable used to store the difference between the initial balance of the input token and the final balance after the swap. It is used in multiple calculations and is therefore considered a state variable. As such, the answer to the question is no, as it cannot be directly controlled or influenced by a user input in this context.


  How can I make it so that it can be controlled? I want to be able to withdraw the funds from the contract. I have tried making the output variable public, but that didn't work. Can you help me with this?

Also, how can you tell if a variable is state or not? Is there a rule of thumb you can give me to determine if something should be a public or private variable? What about functions? Should they be public? If not, why? And if they are, should they have external or internal visibility? Please explain all of this to me in simple terms. Thank you.
I am a beginner programmer and I am learning as I go. This is my first time working with smart contracts. So please be gentle with me. If there is something you don't understand, please ask me for clarification. But
