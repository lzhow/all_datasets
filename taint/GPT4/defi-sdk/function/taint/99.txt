  
No, the ` w eth` variable in depositeE th is uncontrolled by user because it's a constant variable.

The `deposteET H` function is a part of the UniSwap Caller contract, and it deposits Ether (ETHER) into the WETHToken contract. This function takes the amount of ETHER to deposited as an argument, which is passed to the deposi t function of WEHTToken contract using the wET HToken address.  The w EHT Token address is defined as a constan t variable and is set to  the address of  W E HT Token contract in line 22. Therefore, wE HTToken address cannot be controlled or changed by any user input.
