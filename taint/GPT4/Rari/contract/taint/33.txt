The variable `allowResign` in the function `_setImplementationSafe` is labeled as 'unknown'. 

The reason is that the code does not provide enough information to determine if the variable is controlled by the user or not. The function `_setImplementationSafe` takes `allowResign` as an input parameter, but it is not clear from the code how this parameter is set or where its value comes from. Without further context or information, it is not possible to determine if the variable is controlled by the user or not.
