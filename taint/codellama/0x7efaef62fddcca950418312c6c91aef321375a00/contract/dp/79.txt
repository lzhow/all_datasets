  
No, the variables ` balance  ` and ` liquid ` are independent in this function.

The function `_update` updates the reserves of the token pair based on new balances of token  and token . The function does not use the ` ` variable, which is a local variable in ` burn`. Therefore, `  balance ` is not dependent on ` liquids`.
