  
No, the ` account` variable in deposiWithWhiteList is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The `depostWithwhitlist` function is called by a user, but the value of the account parameter is passed as an argument to this function. Therefore, this variable is determined by an external entity, and it cannot be controlled directly by any user input.
