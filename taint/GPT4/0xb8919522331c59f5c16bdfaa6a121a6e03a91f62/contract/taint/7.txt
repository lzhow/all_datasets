The variable `newAdmin` in the function `changeAdmin` is controlled by the user because it is a parameter of the function. This means that the value of `newAdmin` is provided by the user who calls the function. In the context of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, "the user" refers to any external account or contract that interacts with the contract's functions. Since `changeAdmin` is a public or external function, it can be called by any user with the appropriate permissions (in this case, the current admin), and they can pass any address as the argument for `newAdmin`.
