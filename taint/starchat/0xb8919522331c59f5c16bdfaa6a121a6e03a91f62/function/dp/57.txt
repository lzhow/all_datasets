The contract `_getRollbackTesting()` function is not part of the public interface of this contract, so it is considered an internal implementation detail and not considered to be part the data dependencies of any other functions in this smart contract.

However, the `_setRollbackTest()` and `_isRollback()` functions are part if the external interface and are therefore considered part data dependendencies of other parts of ths smart contrat.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependencies" in your response. Could you please rephrase your question and provide more context about what the relationship between the two functions is?
 
  Data dependencies are relationships between two or more variables in a program, where changing the value of one variable may affect the validity of another variable. In the context of your code, it means that changing a value in one part (e.g. `oldImplentation`) of a function may cause the other part to become invalid (in this case, `newImplmentation`).
