  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `while` loop of the first function, the value of `high` is calculated based on `array` and `element`. The value is then used to calculate the midpoint of a range, which is stored in `middle`. This range is used in a comparison with `if ( array [mid ] > Element )`.
If the condition is true, then the high value will be updated to the middle value. If the comparison is false, low will increase by 2.
Therefore, ` low` depends on both ` high`and ` mid`.
