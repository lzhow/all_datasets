Label: no

Reason: The contract state `SELECTOR` is a constant defined as `bytes4 private constant SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(bytes('transfer(address,uint256)')));` which means its value is determined at compile time and it is based on the hash of the string literal 'transfer(address,uint256)'. It does not depend on any runtime variables or states.

On the other hand, the variable `value` in the function `_safeTransfer` is a parameter that is passed at runtime when the function is called. The `value` represents the amount to be transferred and is independent of the `SELECTOR` constant.

Since `SELECTOR` is a compile-time constant and `value` is a runtime variable, there is no data dependency relationship between them. The `SELECTOR` is used to encode the function call to the ERC20 `transfer` function, and its value remains the same regardless of the `value` passed to `_safeTransfer`.
