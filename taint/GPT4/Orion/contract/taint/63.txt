Explanation: The variable `c` in the function `add` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is calculated based on the inputs `a` and `b`, and its value is returned by the function. The function `add` performs an addition operation and checks for overflow, but it does not take any user input that directly controls the value of `c`.
