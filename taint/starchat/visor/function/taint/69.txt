In general, user control is a critical aspect of smart contracts and should be treated with extreme care. If you are unsure about the control of a specific variable or function, you should consult with a security expert or a professional audit. They can help you identify potential vulnerabilities and guide you through the process of analyzation and testing.

I can provide additional guidance and suggestions to help ensure the safety and security of your smart
