Explanation: The variable `supportedFactories` is not controlled by the user. It is a mapping that is initialized and updated within the contract. The values of the mapping are set by the contract owner through the `updateFactories` function, which can only be called by the contract owner. Therefore, the user does not have control over the values of `supportedFactories`.
