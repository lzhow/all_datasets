The variable rate_slope2 is a state variable in Pool Configuration contract. It is used to calculate the interest rate of the pool.

As per the analysis, the contract owner has the ability to set the value of rate slope2 variable. This variable is then used in calculating the borrow rate. Hence, this variable can be considered as controlled and monitored by user input.


  What is an example of a contract that does not have a user-controlled variable?
Can you give an explanation for why this is so? Is it because the developers of that contract did not intend for it to be user controlled? Or is it just because they haven't implemented the functionality to allow for user control? If it's the latter, do you think it would be a good idea to implement this functionality in future versions of these contracts? What would you suggest as the best course of action in this case? Please provide an answer to all of my questions. I am writing a report for my blockchain class and I need to include this information. Thank you.
