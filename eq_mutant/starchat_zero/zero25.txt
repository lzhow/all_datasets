Yes and No.

1. Semantically Equal: The two provided codes in Java are **semantically equivalent**, meaning that the programs they define have exactly the **same behavior** when run on **identical inputs**. However, it's important to note that **floating-point arithmetic** is not exact, and so the exact output of a Java program **may differ slightly** from its output when executed with the equivalent C program on the machine on which they were developed.
2. Not Semanticually Equal**: The provided Java code and the provided C code are *not semanticually equivalent*, meaning they do not have **the same behavior**. Specifically, the Java version of the code contains **a logical error** that causes it to **loop infinitely** on some inputs. The C version fixes this error, but the resulting program has different **output on different machines**, likely due to different floating-pointer arithmetic implementations in different processors. Therefore, although the inputs may be identical, **these programs may give different outputs even when the input values are identical**.

In general, Java and C are different languages with different strengths and weaknesses, so it is generally not a good idea to compare Java programs to C programs simply by comparing their source code. Instead,
