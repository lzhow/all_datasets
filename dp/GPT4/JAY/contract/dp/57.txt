The contract state `nftsSold` is data dependent on the variable `_p_scope_0` in the function `updateFees`. The variable `_p_scope_0` is used to calculate the new fee values, specifically `sellNftFeeEth` and `buyNftFeeEth`. These fees are then used in the `sell` function to determine the amount of ETH to be transferred to the `dev` address and the amount to be burned from the sender's balance. The `sell` function increments the `nftsSold` state variable each time a sale occurs. Therefore, any changes to the fees as a result of `_p_scope_0` calculations indirectly affect the `nftsSold` variable by potentially influencing the number of sales that occur, given that the fees can impact the attractiveness of the sale conditions to potential buyers.
