The variable `to` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `_to` in the function `_swap`. The value of `to` is determined by the condition `i < path.length - 2 ? OrionMultiPoolLibrary.pairFor(curFactory, output, path[i + 2]) : _to`, which does not involve the variable `_to`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
