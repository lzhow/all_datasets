Reason: The contract state `EQUILIBRIUM` is not mentioned in the provided function `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance`. The function calculates the compounded borrow balance for a user based on the user's borrow shares (`userBorrowShares`) and the `_token` parameter. The variable `_user` is used to access the `userPoolData` mapping to retrieve the `borrowShares` for that specific user and token. Since `EQUILIBRIUM` is not referenced or used in any computation within this function, there is no data dependency relationship between `EQUILIBRIUM` and the variable `_user` based on the given code snippet.
