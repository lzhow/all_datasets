  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_withrawal` variable is passed as an argument to the `getGrosLliquidtyAndBallances` function. This function returns a tuple containing the gross liquidity and balances of the curve, which are then assigned to `_oBal` and `_grossLiq` variables.
Then, `_multipiler` is calculated using the formula `_witdrawl. divu (1 e1 8) . div (curv. totalSuppy. Divu 1E1) `, where `div` performs integer division.  The `total supply` of `Curv` contract is used in this calculation. Therefore, ` _ multiplier` depends on ` curve`.
Furthermore, in both functions,  the length of `_assets` array is stored in `_ length` . This array contains the addresses of all the assets in ` Curv`. Therefore `_lenght` also depends  on  ` curv`.
