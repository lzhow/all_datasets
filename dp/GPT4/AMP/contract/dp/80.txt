Reason: The variable `_addedValue` in the function `increaseAllowanceByPartition` is used to increase the allowance of a spender by a certain value for a specific partition. This variable is an input to the function and is used to calculate the new allowance by adding it to the current allowance amount for that partition and spender, which is then stored in the `_allowedByPartition` mapping.

On the other hand, the function `transferFrom` is used to transfer tokens from one address to another, and it does not directly use the `_addedValue` variable. The `transferFrom` function checks the allowance of a spender to transfer a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the owner, but it does not depend on the `_addedValue` variable itself. The allowance that `transferFrom` checks is the result of whatever the current allowance is set to in the `_allowedByPartition` mapping, which could have been affected by many different calls to `increaseAllowanceByPartition` or other functions that modify allowances, such as `approveByPartition` or `decreaseAllowanceByPartition`.

Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between the variable `_addedValue` in `increaseAllowanceByPartition` and any variable in `transferFrom`. The two variables are related through the state of the `_allowedByPartition` mapping, but they do not have a direct data dependency.
