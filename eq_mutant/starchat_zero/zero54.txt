This is the first code:

```
// This code computes the square root of a number
#include <math.h>
double sqrt_function(double number)
{
    double current_guess = number/2;
    while(current_gues >.001)
    {
        double new_current = current(guess/ 3) + (number/current( guess)) /3;
        if(new_cuurent == current guess)
        {
            return current (guess);
        }
        current Guess = new current
    }
    return "failed";
}
int main()
return 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(sqrt_functino(8))
The second program is syntactically identical to the firs
t and is semanticly equivalent.
