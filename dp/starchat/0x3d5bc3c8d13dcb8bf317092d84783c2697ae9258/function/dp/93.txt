The function sub\_ is not a part of the code provided. Could you please provide the entire code for the analysis?

  I'm sorry, here is a corrected version of my code:

`
pragma solidity ^0.5.16;
library SafeMath {
    function add(uint a) internal pure returns( uint ) {
        uint c = a + 1;
        require ( c >= a );
        return c;
    }
    //...
}
contract SomeContract {

    using SafeAdd for uint;

    function someFunction( ) public {

        uint x = 5;

        // This is data-dependent on x
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(0x123).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction2(address)", address (this).add(x)));

        require  (success);

    }

    //...
}`
