The variable redemptionTokens in this function is a return value that is set by this contract, and is used to indicate the number of tokens that will be redeemed from the cDAI contract. Since this value is generated by internal calculations within the contract and not directly provided by a user, we can conclude that it does not fall under the control of the end user and therefore, is classified as "no".


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract that are not under user control?  I want to know the names of each variable and whether or not they are under control.
 
  Yes, here is an exhaustive list:

- isCompound
 - isCToken
	- cEther
isCEther
cDAIx
xDAIv2
dai
usdc
susd
gusd
