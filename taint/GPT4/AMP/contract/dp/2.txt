Label: no

Reason: The variable `recipientImplementation` is assigned a value based on the result of the `interfaceAddr` function call, which takes `_to` and `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT` as arguments. The value of `recipientImplementation` is independent of the variable `toPartitionPrefix`, which is used to determine the partition strategy prefix and is not involved in the computation or assignment of `recipientImplementation`. The two variables are used in separate logical parts of the function and do not influence each other's values.
