Label: no

Reason: The variable `error` in the function `addExp` is the result of the `addUInt` function, which takes `a.mantissa` and `b.mantissa` as arguments from the `addExp` function scope. The variable `a` in the function `divExp` is a different instance of the `Exp` struct, scoped only within the `divExp` function. There is no data flow from `a` in `divExp` to `error` in `addExp` since they are in separate function scopes and there is no shared state or parameters passed between these two functions that would create a data dependency.
