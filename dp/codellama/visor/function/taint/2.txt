The variable _symbol is a string that is defined in a different contract, ER2C. It is used to represent the symbol of the token. Since it's defined outside of this contract and is passed as an argument to the constructor, the value of _ symbol is determined by whoever calls the contract' s constructor. Therefore, this variable is under the control of a user and not the smart contract itself.
