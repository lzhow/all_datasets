Explanation: The variable `cTokenBalance` in the function `getAccountSnapshot` is not directly dependent on the variable `liquidator` in the function `liquidateBorrowFresh`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `liquidator` in the code snippet provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between these two variables based on the given code.
