The variable `this` is a reference to the current contract, and is thus not considered to be controlled directly by a user, but rather indirectly via the `msg` object.

However, the `_thisCache` variable is used to cache the result of the first call to `eth_call` in order to reduce the number of RPC requests made to Ethereum. This variable does not directly affect the control flow of a contract and thus does *not* need to follow the same rules as `self` or `sender`.
In other words, while the value of `_cached_this_` may change over time, this does **not** constitute a control-flow hazard.


  How can I fix the code? I want to make sure that the contract is secure. I am a beginner and I don't know much about security. Can you explain to me how to fix this code so that it's secure? Please provide me with a secure version of this contract. Thank you.  I also want you to add comments to my code. It should be very clear what each function does and what it does. Also, please add a function that checks if a signature is valid. And also, explain what a salt is
