  
The variable _ partition in increase Allowance By Partitions is a parameter of the method, so it can be controlled or not by a user depending on the context in which the contract is used.

If the _ _Partiton_ _ parameter is passed as an argument to the increase allowances by partition method and the value of this parameter comes from user input, then it would be considered controlled. However, if this value is calculated or derived from other variables within the smart contract, such as the address of a token holder or the name of an interface, the parameter would not be under the control of user and would therefore be classified as not being controlled under user control.
