Label: no

Reason: The variable `tickUpper` in the function `checkTicks` is an input parameter that is used to perform checks within that function. It is independent of any other state or variables outside of its scope. On the other hand, the variable `amount0Requested` in the function `collect` is also an input parameter that is used to determine how much of a token should be transferred. There is no direct relationship or computation in the provided code that indicates `tickUpper` is used to calculate, modify, or otherwise influence the value of `amount0Requested`, nor is `amount0Requested` used to influence `tickUpper`. They are used in separate functions for different purposes without any shared state or logic that connects them, hence there is no data dependency between `tickUpper` and `amount0Requested`.
