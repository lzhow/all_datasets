The variable 'value' in function `_safeTranfer` is not dependent on variable '_reserver0' from function 'burn'.
This is because the value of 'resever0', which is a local variable in ' burn', is passed as an argument to the ' _ safeTranser' function.  The ' value' variable is only dependent of the argument passed to it.
