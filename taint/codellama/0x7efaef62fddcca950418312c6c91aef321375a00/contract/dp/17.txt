  
No, the `mbalancesOf ` contract is not dependent on `_ reserves1`. The `_ mbalancOfes` contract stores the balance of each address in a mapping, and the `_ mintFees` function only uses the current balance and not the reserve balance.

The `_ reserve` variables are used to calculate the price of the token and to ensure that the liquidty is sufficient, but they do not affect the calculation of ` _balanOf`.
