  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `for` loop of the first function, the `_gliq` variable is multiplied by the corresponding `_weigh`t variable in `_bali`s, and the result is stored in ` _idel`. The `psi_`variable is then incremented by calling the`calculatemicrofee` function with the arguments `_bal`, `_idel`,`_beta`, and `_delt`.
  The`psi` value is calculated by adding the results of multiple calls to the  ` calculatemicr`o`fe`e function.
   The `_beta` and` _deli` variables are used in each call to ` calculate microfe`, but they do not affect the value of `_idal`. Therefore, `_del` is data-dependent on `_idl`.
