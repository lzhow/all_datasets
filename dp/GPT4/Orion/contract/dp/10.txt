Yes, the variable `c` in the function `tryMul` is data dependent on the variable `a` in the same function. 

Explanation: In the function `tryMul`, the value of `c` is calculated by multiplying `a` and `b`. Therefore, the value of `c` is directly dependent on the value of `a`. Any change in the value of `a` will affect the value of `c`. Hence, there is a data dependency relationship between `c` and `a` in the function `tryMul`.
