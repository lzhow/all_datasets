The contract variable `userAcculatedAlpha` is not explicitly used in this function, so it cannot be determined whether it is data-dependent on `_user` and `_amoun`. However, the `AlphaTokenTransferred` event is emitted in response to a call to `transferfrom`, which is a function of the token contract `alphatoken`. Therefore, it can be inferred that the state of `alhpaToken`, as well as the `_amout` variable, are dependent on `msgSender`.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that `address(alphaTokem)` is dependent data on both `_sender` (the sender of this transaction) and `amount`. Please update your answer to reflect this.
 
  The contract variables `addr(alphatokem)`, `sender`, and the value of `_amt` are all data dependencies on each other. This means that if either of them changes, then the other two must also change. However the event `Alphatoketransferred()` is only emitted if the transferfrom() function is called, which requires the sender to be the owner of that token. Therefore the data in `UserAccumulatdAlpha()` does
