Label: no

Reason: The variable `selector` in the function `getPermitSelector` is not controlled by the user. It is determined by the contract's logic based on the `permitType` that is passed to the function. The `permitType` is an enum that represents different types of permit functions, and the `selector` is assigned the corresponding function selector from a predefined set of options within the contract code. The function selectors are constants that correspond to specific functions in other contracts (like `IEIP2612.permit`, `IDAIPermit.permit`, `IYearnPermit.permit`) and are not influenced by external user input.
