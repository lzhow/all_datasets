The variable "receipt" in function "claim" is a struct that is defined within the scope of the "Vesting" contract. It is used to store information about each individual vested receipt, such as the recipient address, the amount of ALPHA tokens vest, and the date the receipt was created.

Since the struct is declared within a contract, Solidty automatically assumes that all variables declared inside the contract are controlled exclusively by that contract and are not accessible by any other contract or user of that blockchain. Therefore, in this case, we can say that the value of "claimed" cannot be controlled directly by a user or another contract on the blockchain, as it can only be modified by code within this specific contract instance.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiity





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?
A J-P-Perm P LL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, or P' algorithm. J and P algorithms are easy to understand and implement, but Pâ€™ is considered to be more difficult. P is also known as Roux and is often used
