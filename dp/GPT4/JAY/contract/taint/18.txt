Explanation: The variable `success` in the function `buyJayNoNFT` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the result of the `call` function, which is used to invoke an external contract. The value of `success` depends on the success or failure of the external contract call, which is determined by the execution of the external contract and not controlled by the user.
