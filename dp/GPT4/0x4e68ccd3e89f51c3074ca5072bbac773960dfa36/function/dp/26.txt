Label: no

Reason: The variable `liquidityNet` is calculated within a conditional block that checks if `state.sqrtPriceX96 == step.sqrtPriceNextX96` and if `step.initialized` is true. It is assigned a value based on the result of the `ticks.cross` function, which is influenced by the current state of the swap, including the tick values and fee growth, but not directly by the `delta` variable.

The variable `delta`, on the other hand, is calculated within a different conditional block that checks if `cache.feeProtocol > 0`. It is used to adjust the `step.feeAmount` and increment the `state.protocolFee`. There is no direct assignment or computation that would affect `liquidityNet` using the `delta` variable within the given code paths.

Therefore, `liquidityNet` does not have a data dependency on `delta` as they are calculated independently within separate conditional blocks and are not used in conjunction with each other in any of the calculations.
