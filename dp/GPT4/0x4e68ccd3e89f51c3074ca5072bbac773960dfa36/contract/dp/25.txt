Label: no

Reason: The variable `liquidityNet` in the function `cross` is not data dependent on the variable `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` within the same function. In the `cross` function, `liquidityNet` is simply assigned the value of `info.liquidityNet` without any computation or modification that involves `feeGrowthGlobal1X128`. The other operations in the `cross` function that involve `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` are updating the `info.feeGrowthOutside1X128` state, but these operations do not affect the value of `liquidityNet`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `liquidityNet` and `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` in the context of the `cross` function.
