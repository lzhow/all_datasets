The contract has a function called `add` that adds new or updated price oracle contracts to the mapping `oracless`. The function has two parameters: `underllying` and `_oraclse`. `underlying` is an array of addresses that represent the underlying assets for which the price oraclses are being added. `_oracle`is an arry of priceoracle contracts that are associated with the corresponding underlying addresses.

In the `MasterPriceOrcle` contract, the address of the administrator is stored in a variable called admin. This variable is set in th constructor and cannot be changed. 

There is a modifier called onlyadmin that requires the sender of a transaction to be the same as the value of admin in order to execute the transaction.
