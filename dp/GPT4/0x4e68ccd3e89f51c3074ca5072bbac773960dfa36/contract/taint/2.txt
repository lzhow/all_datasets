Label: no

Explanation: The variable `exactIn` in the function `computeSwapStep` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is determined based on the value of `amountRemaining`, which is an input parameter to the function. The user can control the value of `amountRemaining`, but not directly control the value of `exactIn`. Therefore, the label is 'no'.
