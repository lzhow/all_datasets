  
No, the variables ` blocknumber` and ` j_ scope_ ​​0 ` are independent.

The variable` block number` is a global variable that is updated in each block of the blockchain. It is used to keep track of how many blocks have been mined since the beginning of time.  The variable  `  j _scope _0  is` a local variable in function  claimrewards. This variable is only used in this function and is never updated. Therefore, it is independent of  block Number.
