  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `while` loop of the binary search function, the value of `i` is calculated using the formula `(l+r)/2`. The value `r` depends on `cardinality`, which is a function parameter. Therefore, `beforeorAt` and `atOrafter` depend on both `self` (which is an array of observations) and the index of that array, which depends directly on index.
