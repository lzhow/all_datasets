  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `target` variable is passed as an argument to the `_verifycallResult` function, which is called after the staticcall function. This means that the value of `returdata`, which depends on `sucess`, is used as a parameter to `_verifcallresult`. Therefore, `dat` is data-dependent on`success`.
