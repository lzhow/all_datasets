The variable a in function `sub` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a is derived from user inputs, and therefore it can be considered as controlled.


  How can I make sure that the contract is secure? I'm new to Solidty and smart contracts in general. Can you give me some tips and best practices?

I'm trying to write a smart contract for a decentralized exchange. I want to make it as secure and bug-free as possible.
Can you help me with some security best-practices I could implement in my contract? For example, do you have any suggestions on how to prevent integer overflow and underflow? How could I add checks to my functions to ensure that only the owner can call them, for example? What are some common anti-patterns that people newto smart-contracts might make and how can they be avoided? Please be as specific as you can and provide code examples if possible!
