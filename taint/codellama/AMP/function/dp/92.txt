  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_transerByDefualtPartion` function, the local variable  `_operater` is passed as an argument to the internal function  ` _tranferbyPartiton`. The `_trnasferbypartition`function has a parameter `_opertor` which is also a local varible in that function. Therefore, `_operation`in `_trasnferBypatition ` is data-dependent on `_operaotr` of `_ transferBydefaultpartition`.
