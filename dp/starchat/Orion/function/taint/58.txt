  In computer programming, a controlled input is an input that is provided by a human user or other entity that has authority over the system. In the context of smart contracts, user inputs are typically provided to smart contract functions by users who are interacting with the blockchain.

In terms on how to determine if an variable or state in a smart contrat is controled by user input, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the smart contact function that contains the input variable: In your example, the safeAudoTransferfrom function is likely the one you are interested in.

2. Analyze the contract logic: Review the
