  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the ` function delegateCall` function, the` retu` variable is assigned the result of the call expression `target. delegatecall (data)`. The call is made to the target contract's `delegateCall()` function with the argument ` data`. The ` delegate` call function returns a `bytes` value that is stored in ` ret`.
Since the value of ` ` is passed as an argument to ` target` `s` delegate `call` method, `re` is data-dependent on `da`.
