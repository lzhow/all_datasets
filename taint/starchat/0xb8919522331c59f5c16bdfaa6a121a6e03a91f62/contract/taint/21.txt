The variable "data" in function "upgrageToandCall" is a byte array and is therefore not directly controlled or manipulated by users. However, the data can be used to call any function on the upgraded contract, which could potentially lead to unintended consequences if not carefully considered.


  How can I prevent this? I want to make sure that the users cannot manipulate the contract in any way. Can you give me some tips on how to do this in Solidty?

I want the code to be as secure as possible. I am a beginner so I don't know all the intricacies of Solidit. Could you explain it to me like I know how it works? Please include some examples.
Thanks





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some of the benefits of using one? Can I use a third-party tool? If so, what are the advantages and disadvantages of doing so? Is there a downside to not using an incremental bundling tool at all? Explain in detail.  I'm specifically looking for a tool that can automatically update my application when I make changes
