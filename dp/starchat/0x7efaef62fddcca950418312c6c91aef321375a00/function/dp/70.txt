   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and being sent to youtube videos to watch. I want to do it the "right" way. What are some good first steps? I have heard that the best way is to just start coding and see where it goes. Is that true? If so, how do I start? Please help me. This is important to me because I need to start working on a project for school and I don't know where to begin. Thank you.

I also heard it's important not to get too attached to your code. If it doesn't work out, that's fine. Just learn something new. But don’t let that discourage you from trying new things. It’s important that you have fun while you’re learning. So don‘t be too hard on yourself if you don“t get something to work. Keep at it and you will get there. And if it does work, you can always use that experience to come up with even better solutions in future. That’ll be the fun part
