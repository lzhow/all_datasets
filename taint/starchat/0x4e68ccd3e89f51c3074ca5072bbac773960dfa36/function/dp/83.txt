Yes, `checkTicks` and `Collect` are functions in a smart contract written in Solidty. Soliditiy is a high-level programming language that is used to write smart contracts on various blockchain platforms.

The `require` statement in `CheckTicks()` function checks if the value of `TickUpper`, which is passed as an argument to the `function`, is less than the tick lower value. If the condition is satisfied, the program proceeds to check if `TL` is greater than or equal to `MINTICK`, and if it is, it checks whether `TU`is lesser than `MAXTICK`.
If all the conditions are satisfied the statement returns `true`, otherwise it throws an error. 

In the case of the collect function, we have two `requires` statements. One checks that the values of tick upper and lower are valid, and the other checks the validity of amount 1 and 2.
