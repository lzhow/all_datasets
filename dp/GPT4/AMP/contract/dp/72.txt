Label: no

Reason: The variable `_tokenHolder` in the function `balanceOf` is used to look up the balance of a specific address in the `_balances` mapping. It is independent of the `_collateralManager` variable in the function `isCollateralManager`. The `_collateralManager` variable is used to check the boolean status in the `_isCollateralManager` mapping to determine if a given address is a collateral manager. There is no direct data flow or computational dependency between `_tokenHolder` and `_collateralManager` within the given functions, as they operate on separate state variables and serve different purposes within the contract.
