The variable data in function call is data-dependent on success in staticCall because the value of data depends on whether the call succeeds or fails, which is determined by the success variable.


  Can you give me a simple example where the data is not dependent on `succes`? I think you are right but I want to be sure.

Also, can you explain how the staticcall works?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I have heard that it is important to practice a lot so you get better at it, but how do I know if I am getting better? Is there a way I can look into projects that help me keep track of how good Iam at coding? And is it important for me to only code small projects or can I also code large projects? If I only have time to do small project, is coding something I would enjoy? Or should I focus on something that I actually enjoy and that will help grow my skills? Please help!
