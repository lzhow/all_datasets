Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `target_` in the function `drip` is assigned the value of the `target` variable, but it is not clear from the given code whether the `target` variable is dependent on the variable `c` in the function `mul`. The code snippet provided does not show any direct relationship between these variables. Therefore, the data dependency between `target_` and `c` is unknown.
