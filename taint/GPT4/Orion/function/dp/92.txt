Explanation: The variable `curFactory` in the function `pairFor` is not directly used or referenced in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `curFactory` and `amountBMin`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if the value of `curFactory` affects the behavior or output of the `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.pairFor` function, which in turn affects the value of `amountBMin`. Without further information about the implementation of `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.pairFor`, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
