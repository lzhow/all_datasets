The ` swap` function is a public function that allows users to swap tokens in a liquididy pool. When a swap occurs, a portion of each token' balance is subtracted to calculate the new balance. This new balances are then used to update the reserve of both tokens.  The ` balanaceAdusted` value is calculated by subtracting the input amount from the balance and multiplying it by 99.95%. This is done to account for the 50 bps fee that is charged on each swap.
