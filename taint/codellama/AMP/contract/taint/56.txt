  
The variable `_operator` in function `_callParitionStrateyOperatorhook` is a parameter of the method, and it's not directly controlled or modified by any user input. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In the context of this function, `_operater` represents the address of a user who is attempting to perform an operation on the contract, such as transferring tokens or approving an allowence. However, this address is passed as an argument to the `_isOperaterForParitition` function and is used as a condition to determine whether the operation should be allowed or not.
