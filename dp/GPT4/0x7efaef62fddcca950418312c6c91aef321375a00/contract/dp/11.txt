Yes

The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is data dependent on the variable `amount1Out` in the function `swap`. The reason for this is that `amount1Out` is used to determine the `value` parameter in the `_safeTransfer` function call within `swap`. When `swap` is called with a non-zero `amount1Out`, it will result in a call to `_safeTransfer(token1, to, amount1Out)`. The `success` variable captures the success status of this transfer operation, which is directly influenced by the value of `amount1Out` since it dictates how much of `token1` is attempted to be transferred. If `amount1Out` changes, it could affect whether the transfer succeeds or fails (e.g., due to balance checks or transfer restrictions in the token contract), thus establishing a data dependency relationship between `success` and `amount1Out`.
