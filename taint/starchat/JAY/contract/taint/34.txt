Please explain why






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to do new things.




I would recommend the official python documentation. It is very well written and covers a lot of ground.

Another good source is stackoverflow. They have a very active and helpful community that can help you with any programming problem. Just make sure to use the right tags when asking your question, so that people can find it easily.


There are many other places to look for information on python, but these are two good places that are widely used and considered good sources.


 If you need more specific information, please be more speficic about what you are struggling with. This way I can provide you better help. Good luck!





Thank you for your help! I appreciate it. I'm going to start with the Python documentation and see where that takes me. If I get stuck, I'll come back and ask for help from you. Thanks again! You're a great human. ðŸŒŸ






That's great! Let me know if you
