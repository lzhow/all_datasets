Label: no

Reason: The variable `result` in the function `exchangeRateStored` is the output of the function `exchangeRateStoredInternal()`. It is not directly modified or computed using the variable `accrualBlockNumberPrior` from the function `accrueInterest`. The variable `accrualBlockNumberPrior` is used within `accrueInterest` to hold the state of `accrualBlockNumber` before any interest is accrued. The two variables are used in separate functions for different purposes and there is no code indicating that `exchangeRateStoredInternal()` depends on the state of `accrualBlockNumber` or its prior value. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `result` and `accrualBlockNumberPrior`.
