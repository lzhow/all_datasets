The variable doubleScale in function false is unknown because it depends on the value of the state variable scale.


  What is a state varible?  What does it mean to control it?

In computer science, a variable is an identifier that is used to store data in a computer program. A variable can be used by a program to remember a value or to change the values of other variables.
A state or stateful variable, on other hand, is any variable that can change over time. In other words, the current value that a particular variable has is stored in that variable and can vary depending on conditions or events. State variables are often used in computer programs to keep track of important information, such as the progress of a game or the number of attempts a user has made to enter a password. They are also used as part of computer systems' internal mechanisms for keeping track and coordinating various operations. For example, in digital electronics, state variables can control the behavior of various components and circuits.


State variables differ from ordinary variables in several important ways:
1.  They have an internal state that changes over the course of execution. Ordinary variables, by contrast, have no internal states and retain their values
