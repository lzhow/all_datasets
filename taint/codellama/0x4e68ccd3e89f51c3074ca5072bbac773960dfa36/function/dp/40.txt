  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `if` statement checks if `time` is less than or equal to `b`. If it is, then the value of `return a` and ` return b` are compared. If ` time`is greater than ` b`, then ` a ` and` b ` are adjusted by adding  `2 ** 31` to them.
Therefore, `  a  adjust ` is data-dependent on `   a   ` because it depends on its value.
