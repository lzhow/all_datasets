  
No, the ` add` variable in get NextSQRTPrice FromAmount  is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The `getNext SQRTPriceFrom Amount1 Rounding Down` function takes in a `bool add ` parameter, which is used to determine whether the amount should be added or subtracted from the current price. This parameter is set by a user when calling the method, so it can be controlled. However, this parameter does not affect the state of the contract, and it does  not change the behavior of any other function. Therefore, we can label it as 'No'.
