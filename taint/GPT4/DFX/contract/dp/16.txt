Explanation: The variable `_assets` in the function `newCurve` is data dependent on the variable `_baseCurrency` in the same function. This can be observed from the assignment statements `_assets[0] = _baseCurrency` and `_assets[2] = _baseCurrency`, where the value of `_baseCurrency` is assigned to elements of the `_assets` array. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
