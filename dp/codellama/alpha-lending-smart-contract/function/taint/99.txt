  
The variable `receiveRuleLength` in function `getrecevierRulelistLength()` is a local variable and is therefore not directly controlled or modified by any user input. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In the `setAlphaReleasRule()` function, a new `Receiver Rule` struct is created and pushed to the end of the array `recieverRuleLis`. The `index` variable is assigned the length of `reveiverRulList` before the new struct was pushed. This means that the value of index is determined by a function call and not by user interaction.
