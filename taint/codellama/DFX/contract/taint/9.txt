  
The variable 'subtractionValue' in function 'decreaseAllowence' is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the value of 'suubtrahction value' comes from a user input.
In the 'require' statement, the condition is checked to ensure that the current allowence is greater than or equal to subtractValue. This means that if subtract value is less than the allowenace, then the require statement will fail, and the transaction will be reverted. Therefore, subtractvalue is a variable that is set by a function call, which is under the control of the contract user, so it can be considered as controlled.
