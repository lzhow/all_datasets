Label: no

Reason: The contract state `priceOracle` is not referenced anywhere in the provided Solidity code, including within the function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityShareAmountExternal`. The variable `_token` is used as a parameter in the function, but since `priceOracle` is not mentioned or used, there is no data dependency relationship between `priceOracle` and `_token` based on the given code snippet. Without seeing the implementation of the function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityShareAmount`, which is not provided, we cannot determine any data dependency with `priceOracle`. Therefore, based on the available information, the answer is 'no'.
