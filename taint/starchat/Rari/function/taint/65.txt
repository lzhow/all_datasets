The variable borrowcaps is a mapping of addresses to uints. It is used to store the borrow caps for each Ctoken.

It is important to note that the mapping is public, and can be modified by anyone. This means that if a user can modify the value of a borrow cap, they can potentially bypass the restrictions on borrowing. Additionally, if there is no borrow limit for a particular CTOKEN, then the address will not be present in this mapping, which could allow anyone to borrow an unlimited amount of the token.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make sure that only the owner of this contract can change the values of borrowcap? If so, how can this be enforced?
Can you give me an example of how to do this in Solidty? I am not very experienced with Solidiy. I would appreciate it if you could give an explanation that is easy to understand. Thank you.
