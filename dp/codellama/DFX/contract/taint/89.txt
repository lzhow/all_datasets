  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `outputNumerair` function, the value of `amount_`, which is assigned to `amnt_`. The value is obtained by calling the external function `delegate` and passing in `iAssmlt.outNumraire` as the first argument and `_dst` (which is a user-controlled variable) as a second argument. Therefore, `ammount_ ` is ultimately controlled  by a variable that is under the control of the end user, and the analysis is complete.
