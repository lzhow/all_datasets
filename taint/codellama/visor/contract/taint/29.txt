  
No, the `deicmals` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a fixed value that is passed as an argument to `ER2C` contract.

The `E2RC` constructor takes in a `string` memory `name`, `symbol`, and `uint` `8` decima`ls` as arguments. These arguments are used to initialize the name and symbol of the token, as well as the number of decmial places to use when displaying the balance. However, since the value of ` decmals ` is fixed and passed in as a parameter, and not set by a user input, then it cannot be considered as controlled variable.
