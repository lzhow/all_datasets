Label: yes

Reason: The contract state `receiverRuleList` is an array of `ReceiverRule` structs that is defined at the contract level in the `AlphaReleaseRuleSelector` contract. In the function `setAlphaReleaseRule`, a new `ReceiverRule` struct instance named `receiverRule` is created and then pushed onto the `receiverRuleList` array. This means that the state of `receiverRuleList` is directly affected by the value of `receiverRule` within the `setAlphaReleaseRule` function, as the latter is added to the former. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `receiverRuleList` and `receiverRule`.
