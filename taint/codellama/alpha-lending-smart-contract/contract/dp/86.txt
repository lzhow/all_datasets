The contract variable `closeFactor` is not directly dependent on `_ token` variable in ` calculate Collatera Amount External` function.  The ` closeFator` value is set in a different function, `setPool`, and is used in other functions. Therefore, the ` _ token ` variable does not affect the value of ` CLO SE_ FACT OR`.
