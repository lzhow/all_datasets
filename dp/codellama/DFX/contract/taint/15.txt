  
No, the `_ swapInfo ` variable in function `originSwapp` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created and used within the scope of the ` origin Swapp ` function. It is only accessible within that function and cannot be accessed or modified by any external code.

The reason for this is that the local variables are stored on the stack, which is a limited resource that can be overwritten by other functions or code that runs on top of it. Therefore, local  variables should be treated as private and not be exposed to external users.
