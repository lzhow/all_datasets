In this case, the `sub` function is a public function, and it takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `string memory`. The `require` statement in this function checks if ` b <=a` is true, which means that the value of ` a` must be greater than or equal to the  value  of  `  b`. If this condition is false, then the transaction will fail and the error message will be displayed. However, this error  message is passed as a parameter to this  function and is therefore controlled  by  the caller. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the message  is user-controlled or not.
