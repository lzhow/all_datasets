The variable `success` in the function `sell` is data dependent on the variable `value` in the function `JAYtoETH`. In the `sell` function, `success` is used to indicate whether the ETH transfer to the `msg.sender` was successful. This transfer amount is calculated as a percentage of the ETH equivalent of the `value` of JAY tokens that the user wants to sell, which is determined by the `JAYtoETH` function.

Here's the dependency chain:
1. The `sell` function takes a `value` parameter, which represents the amount of JAY tokens the user wants to sell.
2. It then calls `JAYtoETH(value)` to calculate the ETH equivalent of the JAY tokens.
3. The result of `JAYtoETH(value)` is then used to calculate the amount of ETH to be sent to the user: `eth.mul(90).div(100)`.
4. The `success` variable is set based on the outcome of the ETH transfer, which uses the amount of ETH calculated from the `value` parameter.

Therefore, the `success` variable's value is influenced by the `value` parameter through the `JAYtoETH` function, establishing a data dependency relationship.
