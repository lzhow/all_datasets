The contract state `dev` is data dependent on the variable `_address` in the function `updateDevWallet`. This is because within the `updateDevWallet` function, the state variable `dev` is directly assigned the value of the input parameter `_address`. The line `dev = _address;` establishes a data dependency relationship where the state of `dev` is updated based on the value passed to `_address` when `updateDevWallet` is called.
