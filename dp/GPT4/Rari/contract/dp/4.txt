Label: yes

Reason: The contract state `compBorrowState` is data dependent on the variable `holder` in the function `claimRewards`. This is because the `claimRewards` function calls the `distributeBorrowerComp` function, which updates the `compBorrowState` based on the `holder` address. Therefore, the value of `compBorrowState` is influenced by the value of `holder`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
