Explanation: The variable `decimals` in the function `curveDecimalToBaseUnit` is not controlled by the user. It is obtained from the `decimals()` function of the `IERC20Simple` contract, which is a predefined interface for ERC20 tokens. The value of `decimals` is determined by the token contract and is not influenced by user input.
