Reason: The function `tryMul` is an internal function, which means it can only be called by the contract itself or contracts deriving from it. Since the code provided does not show how the function `tryMul` is being used within the contract or by external callers, we cannot determine whether the variable `b` is controlled by the user or set by the contract. Without additional context on how the function is invoked, it is not possible to classify the control over `b` definitively.
