In this case, the relationship between the `contract state` and the`variable` is not explicitly defined in this code snippet. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether there is a dependency between them.
However, we can make an educated guess based on other information in  the code. For example, if the  `function liquidationBorrowe`  is part of a larger contract that manages a token, and ` accountTokes` represents the balance of the token held by the borrwer. In this scenario, there would be a direct dependency. However, without more context, this is just a speculation.
