The two provided C and Java codes do not have identical behavior.

When run, the first code sorts an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm, while the second code attempts to sort the array by swapping the values of two elements using an operator that is not defined for integers. These two programs will have different behavior depending on the input, and thus are considered to be semantic different.
