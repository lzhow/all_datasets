  
No, the variables ` index` and ` recipientsImplemenation` are independent.

The variable `_indexPartionsOf` is a mapping that maps an address to an array of bytes. It is not dependent on ` _recipentImlementation`.
On the other hand, ` recipeintImlemenatation ` is an implementation of the ` IampTockensReciepients` interface, which is used to call the hook function ` tokensReceived`. This function takes the address of `to` as an argument, and it is dependent of `_to`. However, this dependency is only in a specific context, when the contract is calling the `_removeTkenFromParition` function. In other contexts, such as when calling other functions, there is no dependency between `recepientImplmentation and _indexParitionsof`.
