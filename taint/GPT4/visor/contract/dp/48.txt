Label: no

Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the size of the code at the address `account`. It is assigned a value based on the result of the `extcodesize` operation on the `account` address. On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` is used as the address on which a static call is performed. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the value of `size` and the value of `target`. The value of `size` is determined independently of the value of `target`, and vice versa. Each variable is used in a different context within their respective functions, and the value of one does not influence or determine the value of the other.
