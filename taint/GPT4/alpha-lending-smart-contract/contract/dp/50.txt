Reason: In the function `giveAlphaToAlToken`, the contract state `distributor` is used to call the `alphaToken()` function, which is then followed by an `approve` function call on the returned address, with the `address(pool.alToken)` and `_amount` as arguments. The `pool.alToken` is derived from the mapping `pools` using the address of the `_token` parameter as the key. This means that the behavior of the `distributor` in this context (specifically, which `alphaToken` is approved to interact with which `alToken`) is dependent on the value of `_token`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the contract state `distributor` and the variable `_token` within the `giveAlphaToAlToken` function.
