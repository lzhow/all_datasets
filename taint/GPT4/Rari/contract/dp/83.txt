Reason: The variable `borrowIndex` in the function `setCompBorrowSpeedInternal` is a local variable that is assigned a value based on the result of calling `borrowIndex()` on the `CToken` instance passed to the function. It is used to calculate the new borrow index for the rewards distribution.

On the other hand, the variable `cToken` in the function `_setCompSupplySpeed` is a parameter of that function and is used to set the supply speed for a given CToken market.

There is no direct data dependency between `borrowIndex` in `setCompBorrowSpeedInternal` and `cToken` in `_setCompSupplySpeed` because they are local to their respective functions and their values are not derived from each other. They operate independently within their own function scopes and are related to different aspects of the contract's state (one to borrowing and the other to supplying). The only commonality is that they both refer to a CToken market, but this does not create a data dependency between the specific variables in question.
