The variable returnData is not dependent on target in functionFunctionStaticcall. This is because the value of return data is determined by the code within the contract at the address specified by target, and the target variable is a parameter to the staticcall function, which is itself called within functionfunctionstaticCall.


  Can you explain why it is data-dependent?
 
  The variable "returnData" is dependent upon the "target" variable in "functionFunctionstatic Call". This occurs because "static call" function is used to call the functions of other contracts. In this case, the data returned by "call" will depend on what the called contract returns. If the other contract changes the state of the blockchain, then the return value will change accordingly. Therefore, "ReturnData "will change according to "Target".

 
 


  What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!   An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bund
