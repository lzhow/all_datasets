Explanation:
In the first function, the `path` variable is passed as an argument to the `_getCurves` function. This function returns a tuple containing the address of the pool and the indices of input and output tokens. These values are then used to calculate the amount of tokens to be exchanged in each pool.
Since the value of `input` and `output` are dependent on `i` which is a loop variable, and these variables are used in calculating the values of pool, curbalnce, amountIndex, it is data-dependent.
