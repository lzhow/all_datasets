yes

In the provided Solidity function `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance`, the contract state `pools` is indexed by the address of the `_token` parameter, as seen in the line `Pool storage pool = pools[address(_token)];`. This means that the specific `Pool` instance retrieved and stored in the `pool` variable is directly dependent on the value of `_token`. The `pools` mapping's state will determine the outcome of the function based on which `_token` is passed as an argument. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the contract state `pools` and the variable `_token`.
