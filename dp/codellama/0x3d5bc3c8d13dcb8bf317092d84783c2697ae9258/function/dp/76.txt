  
No, the variables ` decimsals` and ` mathError` are independent.

The variable  `initial_exchange_rate_mantisa` is a parameter of the `initialize` function, and it is not used in any way in ` borrow_balance_stored_internal`.
On the other hand, ` borrower_index` , ` principal_times_ index`and ` result`are all local variables of `  borrow _balances_ stored_ internal` . They are created and used within the scope of this function and are therefore independent of any external variables.
