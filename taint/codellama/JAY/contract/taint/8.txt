  
No, the ` success  ` variable in function `sale` is uncontrolled by user because it's a local variable and it doesn't have any user input.

The `require` function is used to check if a condition is met, and if it isn' t, an exception is thrown. In this case, ` require (success  , " Ether transfer failed. ");` is checking if `dev. call{ value: ETHe. div (3 3) } ("")` is successful. If it fails, then the exception "Ether Transfer Failed" is raised. However, this does not mean that the value of `sucess` can be controlled directly by a user, as it depends on the result of the call to ` dev .call` and is therefore not directly under the control of a malicious user or attacker.
