Yes

The variable `nextWeekBlock` in the function `getReleaseAmount` is data dependent on the variable `_fromBlock` in the same function. This is because `nextWeekBlock` is initially calculated using the value of `fromBlock`, which is derived from `_fromBlock`. Specifically, `fromBlock` is set to either `_fromBlock` or `startBlock`, depending on which one is greater. Then, `nextWeekBlock` is calculated using `fromBlock` within the following line:

```solidity
uint256 nextWeekBlock = findNextWeekFirstBlock(fromBlock);
```

Since `fromBlock` is dependent on `_fromBlock`, and `nextWeekBlock` is dependent on `fromBlock`, there is a direct data dependency chain from `_fromBlock` to `nextWeekBlock`.
