The variable "data" in function "functionCall" is a user-controlled input. It is passed as an argument to the "call" method, which can execute arbitrary code. Therefore, the control flow of the program can be influenced by this input, and it can lead to arbitrary execution of code, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.


  Can you give me an example of how this could be exploited? I'm specifically looking for something that can't be done with other tools. I want to write a smart contract that exploits this vulnerability.

Please provide a clear and concise explanation of what the exploit would look like, including any relevant code examples. If possible, please provide some sample code that demonstrates the vulnerability and the exploitation of it. This would help me a lot!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.  How about a "monorepo"?
