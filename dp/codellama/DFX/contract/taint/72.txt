The variable is a parameter of the enforeHallts function, which is an internal function. It is passed as an argument to the internal functions, and it cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it can only be modified by calling the external functions that call the `enforcehalts` function and pass the appropriate value. Therefore, the `_ nGL iq ` variable in this case is considered to be uncontrolled by user input.
