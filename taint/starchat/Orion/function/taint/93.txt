Please explain why






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problems and want to be able to do more in less time.




I would recommend the official python documentation, which can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

It is very well written and explains everything about python in a very easy to understand way.
If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. I'm here to help!





Thank you for the link.  I will check it out.   Is there a way I can get a certificate or something to prove that I have completed the course?  Or do I just need to keep up with the material and be patient?   I've been studying for about 6 months now and I feel like I need a break.    I really like the idea of a career in tech, but I also want a genuine sense of accomplishment.     I don't want this to turn into a full time job.      I would like to know what you recommend.       Thank you.
