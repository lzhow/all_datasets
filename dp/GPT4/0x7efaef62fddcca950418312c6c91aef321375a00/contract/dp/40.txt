The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is data dependent on the variable `_token1` in the function `burn`. The reason for this is that `_safeTransfer` is called within the `burn` function and is passed `_token1` as an argument. The `success` variable captures the result of the `token.call` function call, which attempts to transfer `_token1` to a specified address. The outcome of this transfer (and thus the value of `success`) directly depends on the address of `_token1`, which is used in the transfer call within `_safeTransfer`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `success` and `_token1`.
