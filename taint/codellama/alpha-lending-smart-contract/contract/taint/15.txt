The variable _ owner in function `m int` is a private variable that is only accessible within the `Alpha Token` contract. It is initialized in `constructor` function and is never modified after that. Therefore, the value of `_ owner` variable is determined at the time of contract deployment and cannot be controlled or modified by any user action.
