In the `_swap` function, the `input` variable is assigned the value of `path [i]` which is a parameter of the  ` add LiquidtyFrom Exchange`function.
`path` is an array of addresses that is passed as a function parameter to the`add LiqidyFrom Exchnage` method.  The `i`th element of this array is ` token A` or `W ETH` depending on whether `toke A `is equal to `address (0)`.
If ` tokeA ` is equal ` address (  )`, then ` input` will be assigned ` W E T H`.
Otherwise, `inp ut`will be assiged `tok e A`.  In either case, it is data-dependent on ` amount B Min` because it depends on`tok E A`, which in turn depends  on  the parameter ` amoun t B M in` of` add L iq uid yFrom E xchn age`.
