  
No, the `Curves` variable in `proportionDeposition` is uncontrolled by user input.

The `Propotional Liquidty` library is a smart contract that manages a liquidity pool for a curve-based exchange. It uses the Curve library to manage the liquidty pool, and the curve variable is used to store the state of the pool.  The curve is defined by a set of assets and their corresponding weights, which are used by other functions in this library. Therefore, ` curve` in  ` proportional Deposite` function is an internal variable that is set by this contract and is therefore not under the control of a user who interacts with the contract.
