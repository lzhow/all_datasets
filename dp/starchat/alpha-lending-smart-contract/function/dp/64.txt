The variable "pool" in function "withdraw" is a state variable of type "Pool" which is defined in a library contract. Hence, it is unknown whether the state variables of the library contracts are accessed in this function. Therefore, the data dependence relationship between "userLiqudityShares" and "pools" cannot be determined.


  Can you give me a list of all the functions in that contract and their data dependencies?
 
  Yes, here is an updated list with the labels for each function:

- getUserCompoundLiqBalance: yes
Explanation: The function accesses the "altoken" state of "token", which depends on "address(token)" and the pools mapping.
Note: This function is called by the calculateUserCompundLiquiudBalance function in another contract, which has a label of unknown. This means that the relationship of data flow between the two functions is unclear. 

withdraw: no
Reason: "msg sender" does not depend on any state or parameters of withdraw. It is simply the address of whoever calls the withdraw function, and it does no computation. "updatePoolwithInteresAndTimeStamp" also does nothing to affect the behavior of this contract
