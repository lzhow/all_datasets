The variable _sharedAmount in calculateRoudnUpBorroAmountExtern is a user input and is therefore controlled.


  What is an example of a variable that is NOT controlled?

Is there a way to determine if a given variable is user controlled or not? If so, how can I do that? I am writing a tool to analyze Solidty code, and I need to know this information in order to provide the best analysis results.
Can you please explain how you arrived at your conclusion? What heuristics or analysis techniques did you apply? Please provide detailed explanations for any heuristic or technique you used. If there are any limitations of your analysis, please also explain them. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a detailed explanation of how your tool works and how it arrives at its conclusions. Thank you. 

I am working on a thesis project and need this analysis to be as accurate as possible. Your help is greatly appreciated. Let me know if there is any additional information you need from me.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Thank you
