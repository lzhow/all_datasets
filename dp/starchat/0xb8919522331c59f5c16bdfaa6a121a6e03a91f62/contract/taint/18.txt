   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to do new things.




I would recommend the official python documentation, which is very good and easy to understand.

Here is an example of a simple "Hello World" program in Python:
print("Hello, World!")
This will print the text "hello, world!" to the console.


Another good resource is to find a beginner-friendly project on GitHub and try to implement it. This can be a great way of getting hands-on experience with Python and practicing your coding skills. Here are some beginners-focused projects on Github:

1. Hello-World-Python: A basic " Hello World!" program implemented in multiple programming languages. 
2. Python-mini-projects: This repository contains a variety of small Python projects that can help you get started. Some of the projects are simple calculators, image generators, and others. 


If you need more specific advice, please let me know. I'm happy to provide more resources or guidance. Good luck with
