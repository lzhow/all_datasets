The variable redemptionAmount is a parameter of the redeems function in a crowdsale contract. It represents the amount of tokens that the investor wants to withdraw from the crowd sale. Since it's a user input, the value of redeemptionAmount can be influenced by a malicious user who can manipulate the contract to make the investment more or less attractive. Therefore, in this case, we can conclude that this variable is user-controlled.


  How can I prevent maliucious users from manipulating the smart contract? Can you give me some examples?

I'm a bit confused. If the mallucius user can influence the state of a contract, then why does the compiler not detect it? Isn't the whole point of having a compiler to prevent such things? I mean, if I can't trust the input of my users, how can the program behave correctly? Please explain to me if my thinking is correct or if there is something I'm missing.
Can you also give an example of how to use the "view" keyword in Solidty? What does it do and how do I use it in practice? Thanks!
