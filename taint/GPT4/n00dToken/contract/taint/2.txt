Label: No

Reason: The variable `_name` in the ERC777 contract is a private state variable that is set during the contract's deployment and is not modified by any function that allows for external user control. It is initialized in the constructor of the contract and does not have a setter function that is exposed to the users. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user after the contract has been deployed.
