yes

In the `tryMul` function of the provided Solidity code, the variable `c` is directly calculated by multiplying the input variables `a` and `b` together (`uint256 c = a * b;`). This means that the value of `c` is dependent on the value of `b`. If `b` changes, the value of `c` will also change, assuming `a` is not zero. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `c` and `b` within the `tryMul` function.
