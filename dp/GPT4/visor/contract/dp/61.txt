Label: yes

Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `mint` is data dependent on the variable `to` in the function `_beforeTokenTransfer` because when `mint` is called, it internally calls `_mint`, which then calls `_beforeTokenTransfer`. The `amount` being minted is passed through these function calls and is used in `_beforeTokenTransfer` to determine the logic related to the token transfer, such as updating snapshots or balances. Since the `amount` is used in the logic that affects the state related to the `to` address, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
