  
No, the ` borrowCap` variable is NOT controlled  by user in this contract.

The reason is that the contract has a `public` modifier on the  ` borrowcaps ` variable, which means that it can be accessed and modified by anyone. Additionally, there are no restrictions on who can modify the value of the borrow caps, so it could be modified at any time by any user or smart contract that has access to the blockchain. Therefore, we can conclude that ` BorrowcAp` is uncontrolled by users.
