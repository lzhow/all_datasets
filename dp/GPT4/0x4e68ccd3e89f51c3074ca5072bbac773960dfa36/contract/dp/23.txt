Reason: In the Solidity code provided, the variable `denominator` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` is calculated using the variable `liquidity` as part of its formula. Specifically, `denominator` is assigned the value of `numerator1 + product`, where `numerator1` is calculated as `uint256(liquidity) << FixedPoint96.RESOLUTION`. This direct use of `liquidity` in the calculation of `denominator` establishes a data dependency relationship between the two variables. Additionally, the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` is called within the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromInput`, which passes its `liquidity` parameter to `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp`. Therefore, any changes to `liquidity` in `getNextSqrtPriceFromInput` will affect the value of `denominator` in `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp`, confirming the data dependency.
