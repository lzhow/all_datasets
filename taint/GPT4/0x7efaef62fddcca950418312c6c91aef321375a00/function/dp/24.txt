Label: no

Reason: The variable `price1CumulativeLast` is not present in the provided function `swap`, and there is no direct interaction or assignment shown in the code snippet that would indicate a data dependency relationship between `price1CumulativeLast` and `_token0`. The variable `_token0` is used locally within the `swap` function to perform token transfers and to get the balance of the token, but without additional context or code showing how `price1CumulativeLast` is updated or used, we cannot establish a data dependency relationship between these two variables. Therefore, based on the given code, `price1CumulativeLast` and `_token0` are not data dependent.
