Reason: The variable `data` in the function `_safeTransfer` is used to store the return value of the low-level `call` to the `token` contract, which is used to perform a token transfer. It is a local variable within the scope of the `_safeTransfer` function and is used to ensure that the token transfer was successful.

On the other hand, the variable `liquidity` in the function `_mintFee` is a local variable that is used to calculate the amount of liquidity tokens to mint based on the reserves and the K constant (which represents the product of the reserves). The calculation of `liquidity` is independent of the `_safeTransfer` function and does not rely on any of the operations performed within `_safeTransfer`.

Since there is no direct or indirect relationship where the value of `data` depends on the value of `liquidity`, or vice versa, we can conclude that these two variables are not data dependent.
