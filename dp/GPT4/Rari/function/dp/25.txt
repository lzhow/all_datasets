Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `mathErr` in the function `mintAllowed` is not directly dependent on the variable `market` in the function `_setCollateralFactor`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `market` in the calculation or manipulation of `mathErr` in the `mintAllowed` function. Therefore, the data dependency between these two variables is unknown.
