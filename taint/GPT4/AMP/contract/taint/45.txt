The variable _tokensHolder in function `partitionsOF` is a public variable and is therefore controlled directly by users.


  How can I make sure that the `_tokensHolders` variable is never modified? I want to prevent users from being able to change the ownership of the contract. I know that Solidty has modifiers that can be used to restrict access to certain functions, but I don't know which one to use in this case. Can you help me with that?

Also, how can we make it so that users cannot transfer more tokens than they have? Can we use modifiers for that as well? If so, which ones? Please provide an example for each modifier.
I want the code to be as safe as possible, so please provide me a full list of all modifiers I need to include in my code. Also, please add comments to my functions to make the logic of my contract clearer. Thank you!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples? Is it like Webpack or Rollup? Explain it to me like I am 5.  I'm trying to understand the role of bundlers in web development
