Yes

The variable `liquidityNet` is data dependent on the variable `slot0Start` in the function `swap`. This is because `liquidityNet` is calculated within a conditional block that uses `step.tickNext`, which is derived from `state.tick`, which in turn is initialized with `slot0Start.tick`. Additionally, the calculation of `liquidityNet` also directly uses `slot0Start.tick` as an argument in the call to `ticks.cross`. Since `slot0Start` is a snapshot of the `slot0` state at the beginning of the function, any variables that are derived from or use the properties of `slot0Start` are data dependent on it.
