  
The variable 'new Admin' in function 'change Admin is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled or manipulated by a user in a malicious way.

In the context of the smart contract, the 'admin' is a privileged user who can perform certain actions, such as changing the implementation of a proxy contract. By allowing the admin to change the address of another contract that is being proxied, an attacker could potentially gain control of that contract and manipulate its state. Therefore, in this case, ' new Admin ' is considered to be under the control and manipulation of user, and it should be treated with caution.
