Explanation:
In the first function, the `for` loop iterates over the elements of the array `swap.data.paths` and assigns the current element to the local variable i.
`tokenindex` is a local integer variable that is used to keep track of which element of `paths[]` to use.  It is initialized to  `withFactory? 3: 4`
If `path` has more than 5 elements, then `new_paths[ ]` will be initialized with the remaining elements. `I` starts at `0` if `tokens` are `1` or `2` otherwise. It increases by `  +  i` each time the loop is executed. Therefore, ` i ` is data-dependent on ` tokenindex`.
Similarly, in function  do Swap Through Orion Pool, variable  I is also data - dependent on variable token index.
