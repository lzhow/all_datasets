  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `_burn` function is called, which modifies the `total_supply` variable. This means that the value of `r` is dependent on `balances` and `share` variables, and therefore, `_rith` depends on them.
Similarly, in function 2, `want().withdrawn` modifes the balance of the contract, so the result of `_after` also depends. Therefore, both `_diff`and `_witdraw`.
