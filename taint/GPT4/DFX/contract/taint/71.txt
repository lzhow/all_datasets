Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `returndata` in the function `verifyCallResult` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function. However, without further context or information about how `returndata` is obtained or modified before being passed to this function, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not. Therefore, the label is unknown.
