Yes

The variable `data` in the function `shift` is data dependent on the variable `size` because the `shift` function modifies the `offset` field of the `data` struct by adding the value of `size` to it. This operation directly affects the state of `data` based on the value of `size`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
