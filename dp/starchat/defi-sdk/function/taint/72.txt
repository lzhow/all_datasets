The variable swap description is a struct that is passed to the execute function. It contains information about the swap such as the token being swapped, the amount being sent, and the account that will receive the output of the transaction. Since the struct is defined in Solidty, Soliditiy will automatically check if any changes to it are made by verifying that the calling address is equal to swapdescription.Account. Therefore, in this case, since the validate protocol fee signature function is called by a contract other than the router contract, we know that swap Description is uncontrolled by user input and is therefore safe to use.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was five. Thank you!





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, J', and J2 algorithms. J stands for Jewel, which is used to solve the white center. A J' algorithm solves the yellow center, while a J algorithm (also known as J1) solves both the red
