  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `add` function, the `_oracle` variable is assigned a value based on an array of `PriceOracles` passed as an argument. This means that the value of `_oracles[0]` is dependent on `underlays[1]`, and so on.
On the other hand, in ` get Underlying Price` , the` _oracle ` variable does not appear. Therefore, it is not dependent  on `_underlies` .
Therefore, we can conclude that `_ oracl` is data-dependent on` underl ` in` add` and not in  `Get Underlyin` g Price`.
