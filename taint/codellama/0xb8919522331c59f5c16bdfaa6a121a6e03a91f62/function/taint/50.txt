  
The variable 'new Beaon' in function '_upgrateBeaocnToandCall' is labeled as 'No'.

This is because the ' new Beacn' variable is passed as an argument to the '_setbeacon' function, which is a private function. Therefore, the value of 'New Bean' cannot be controlled directly by a user, and it can only be set by internal functions.
