Label: Unknown

Reason: The variable `a` in the function `mulDiv` is an input parameter to the function. Whether it is controlled by the user or not depends on how the `mulDiv` function is called within the contract or by external contracts/users. Since the provided code snippet does not show the context in which `mulDiv` is called, we cannot determine if `a` is supplied by the user or set by the contract logic. Therefore, without additional information about the callers of this function, the control over the variable `a` is unknown.
