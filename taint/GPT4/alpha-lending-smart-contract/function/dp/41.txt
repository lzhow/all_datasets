Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_user` in the function `getUserPoolData` is directly dependent on the variable `_user` in the function `getUserAccount` because the latter is passed as an argument to the former within the `getUserAccount` function. When `getUserPoolData` is called, it is provided with the `_user` address from the context of `getUserAccount`, establishing a clear data dependency relationship between the two variables. They both refer to the same user address and the data flow is from `getUserAccount` to `getUserPoolData`.
