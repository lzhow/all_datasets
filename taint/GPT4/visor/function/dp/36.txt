Reason: The variable `success` in the function `functionStaticCall` is data dependent on the variable `target` because the `success` variable is the result of the `staticcall` function which is invoked on the `target` address with the `data` as an argument. The `staticcall` is a low-level call that executes a read-only function call on a smart contract, and the outcome (success or failure) of this call is directly influenced by the code at the address specified by `target`. If `target` is not a contract or the contract at `target` does not have the function being called, or if there is any other issue with the call, `success` will be false. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `success` and `target`.
