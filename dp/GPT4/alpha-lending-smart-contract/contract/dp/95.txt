Label: no

Reason: The variable `_useAsCollateral` in the function `setUserPool` is used to set the `disableUseAsCollateral` property of a `UserPoolData` struct instance. This property is not used or referenced in the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmountExternal`. The `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmountExternal` function takes two parameters, `_token` and `_shareAmount`, and it appears to perform a calculation based on these inputs without accessing or modifying user-specific data, such as the `disableUseAsCollateral` property. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_useAsCollateral` and any variables in `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmountExternal`.
