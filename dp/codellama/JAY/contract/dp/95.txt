  
No, the state variable `_owners` is not dependent on `id` variable in ` buy Jay With ER C7 7` function.

The reason is that the ` _owner ` variable is a state of the smart contract, and it is set in a different function, `constructor`, and is independent of any other function or variable. In contrast,` ids` are the parameters of ` bu yJ ayWith ER c77`, which are passed to the method when it's called. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
