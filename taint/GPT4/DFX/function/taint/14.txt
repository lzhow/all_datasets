Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `amount` in the function `_approve` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function `_approve` from the `approve` function. The value of `amount` is determined by the user when calling the `approve` function, but it is not directly controlled by the user within the `_approve` function. Therefore, the label is unknown.
