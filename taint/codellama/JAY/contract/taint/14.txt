  
No, the ` from` variable in function `on ER C1 5 9 Received` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` on ER  C 7 6 8 Receive` function is a callback function that is called by an ER768 token contract when a transfer is made. It is used to notify the contract that a token has been transferred to it.  The `  from ` variable is passed as a parameter to the callback and represents the address of the account that sent the token. This address is set by  the ER1288 contract and is therefore not under the control of  user .
