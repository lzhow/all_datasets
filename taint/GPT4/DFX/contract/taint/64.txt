Explanation: The variable `_oGLiq` in the function `enforceHalts` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. Without further information about how `_oGLiq` is assigned a value before calling `enforceHalts`, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not.
