Label: no

Reason: The contract state `EC_50_TRANSFER_FAILURE` is not present in the provided Solidity contract code. Since the state `EC_50_TRANSFER_FAILURE` does not exist within the contract, it cannot have a data dependency relationship with the variable `_to` or any other variable in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` or elsewhere in the contract. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `EC_50_TRANSFER_FAILURE` and `_to`.
