The contract function "swap" is a method that allows users to exchange their ERC-20 token for a new token. This method first checks if the user has approved the Smart contract to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_From` address. If the allowance is not sufficient, the method will revert with the error code "EC_ 5 3 INSUFF I CIENT ALLOWANCE". If this check is passed, then the tokens are transferred from `_FROM` to the `SwapTokenGarbage` contract, and the balances of the two addresses are updated. Finally, an event is emitted to notify other contracts of this transfer.

However, it is important to note that the data dependence relationship between the "totalsupplybyPartition" contract and `_ From` is unknown at this time.


  Is there a way to determine this information automatically?
 
  Yes, there are several automated tools that can help you determine data dependencies in Solidty smart contracts. One such tool is Slither, which is an open-source static analysis framework for Soliditiy smart contract security. Slitherr can be used to automatically analyze Solidiy code for data-dependence vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks. Another
