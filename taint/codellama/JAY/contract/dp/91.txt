  
No, the variables ` er c1 5 6 7 8 9 4 3  ` and `er c  c7  2  t  o  k  e  n  a  d  r  s` are independent.

The reason is that the ` buy NFT s ` function does not use the value of ` e r c  1  5  6  7   8  9  4  3   ` in any way. It only uses the length of the array, which is determined by the number of elements in `e rc  C  A  D  R  S`.
Similarly, `b u y  N  F  T  ' s  does  not  use  the  value  of  er  E  L  I  M  i  m  p  l  y   i n   a n y way . It  only  uses  th e length  od  array ,  which  is d etermined  by  h e number  Of  elements  In  " e R C   C A D R S ".
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two arrays.
