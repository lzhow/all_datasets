  
The variable _ total Partitions is a mapping of bytes 3 2  to uint 6 4  and is defined in line 50 of the code. It is used to store the total number of partitions in a contract.

This variable is created by calling the _ addPartitonTo TotalPartiions function in lines 70 and 80 in which the default partition is added to the mapping. This function adds a partition to a total partition mapping and sets the index of that partition in that mapping to be the length of total partitions.  The _ removePartionFrom Total Partitons function also uses this mapping in order to remove a partitio from the list of all partitions and to set the value of its index to  zero.   The variable  _ allowedBy Partion is also a  mapping that is set in  line  114 and used in _ approval by partition function to allow a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens. In the approvel by partion function, the allowed by parition is updated to reflect the new amount.   
  In conclusion,  the  variable totalpartitiosn is controled by user because it can be modified by adding or removing partitions from it.
