The variable `sqrtRatioAX96` in the function `getAmount0Delta` is data dependent on the variable `sqrtRatioBX96` in the same function. This is because within the function `getAmount0Delta`, there is a conditional statement that swaps the values of `sqrtRatioAX96` and `sqrtRatioBX96` if `sqrtRatioAX96` is greater than `sqrtRatioBX96`. This swap operation creates a direct data dependency between the two variables, as the value of one can directly influence the value of the other within the function's execution context. Here is the relevant code snippet:

```solidity
if (sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96) (sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96) = (sqrtRatioBX96, sqrtRatioAX96);
```

After this potential swap, the calculation of `numerator2` and subsequently `amount0` depends on the values of both `sqrtRatioAX96` and `sqrtRatioBX96`, which further solidifies the data dependency relationship between these two variables.
