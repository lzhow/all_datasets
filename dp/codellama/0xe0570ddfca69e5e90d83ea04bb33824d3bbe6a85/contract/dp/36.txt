  
No, the data dependence relationship between the variables ` r` and `_ shares` is unknown.

The variable r is calculated using the balance of the vaulet and the total supply of shares, and it is independent of `_ sharess`.
On the other hand, `_ share`s is a parameter of ` withdraw` function and is used to calculate the amount of tokens to be withdrawn. However, it does not affect the calculation of variable` r`. Therefore, there is an unknown data-dependence relationship  between ` _ shares `and`r`.
