The answer is no.

`_reserve` is a local variable in `_update` and is not used in `Swap`. Therefore, there is nothing that would make them data-dependent.


  What about the other way around?
  
  The answer to the question is yes.
  `_token` variables are used to access the contract's state, and are therefore data dependencies. However, the `_safeTranfer` function is used as a safe way to transfer tokens, so it does not affect the state of the program. Therefore the variables `_toke0` & `_tok1`, and the `IPancakCalle` contract are state-independent.

  The `_reserves` variable is also used for the calculation of `amountIn`, but it is only used locally in this function, therefore it doesn't affect program state.


In summary, `_tokens` are program-state dependent, while `_resrves` (and other local variables) are only dependent on local program execution. `_transfer` does affect state but is otherwise stateless. So, yes, both variables and functions are dependent in some way on program data. 

Does this help clarify the data dependence relationships? Let me know
