In the `FullMath` library, the two functions ` muldiv` and `mldivRoundUp` are defined. In the first function, `prod` is defined as the product of `a`and ` b`. In ` prod`, `rem`is defined to be the remainder of the division of`a * b` by `denom`. The `if` statement checks if ` rem` equals zero. If it does, then ` result` will be set to `div ( prod, denom)`. Otherwise ` den`will be divided by the greatest power of two that divides ` denominatior`. `twos` represents the result of this division. ` tw`represents the quotient of dividing ` numerator`by `two`. Then `numerator `is dividedby`tw` to get `quotient`. Finally,`prod ` is multiplied by` quot`to get the final result.
  In`muldivRoudingUp`,`result `will have the same value as` mul div` if` rem `equals zero, but if it is not zero then` result ` will have one added to it. Therefore, in`mullDiv`, the value of result is dependent on`b`.
