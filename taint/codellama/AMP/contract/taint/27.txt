  
No, the `_ name` variable in this function does not appear to be controlled directly by a user input. It is a string constant that is set in a constructor function, and it does appear that it could be set to a value that a malicious user could control, but it would require a more in-depth analysis to determine whether this is actually the case.

The `_symbol` and `_total_supply` variables are also set using a constant value in their respective constructor functions, so they are not directly controlled  by user inputs. However, these values could potentially be modified by other contracts or users if they have the appropriate permissions.
