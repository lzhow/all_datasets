The two provided codes do not have exactly the output and may or may not result in same semantic behavior.

However, the difference of the provided patch shows that the while loop of both codes does not iterate the array in the exact same manner. Specifically, in line 39, `while (b < c)` is replaced with `b++` in one code and `++b` is used in another code. When `bound` equals the first element in `data`, this results in different iterations of this loop, resulting in potentially different output in both cases.
