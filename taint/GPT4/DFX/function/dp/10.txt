Explanation: The variable `result` in the function `divu` is data dependent on the variable `lo` in the function `divuu`. This is because the value of `lo` is used in the calculation of `result` in the following line of code: `result += xl / y;`. Therefore, any changes in the value of `lo` will affect the value of `result`.
