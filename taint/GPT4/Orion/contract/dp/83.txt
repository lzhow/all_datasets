Reason: The variable `isLastWETH` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is determined by checking if the last token in the swap path is equal to the `WETH` address. It is a local variable within the scope of the `_doSwapTokens` function and its value is independent of any other function's variables.

On the other hand, the variable `amountAMin` in the function `_addLiquidity` is a parameter that specifies the minimum amount of token A that must be provided by the liquidity provider. It is also a local variable within the scope of the `_addLiquidity` function.

Since `isLastWETH` and `amountAMin` are local variables in different functions and there is no code in the provided Solidity contract that creates a dependency between them, they are not data dependent.
