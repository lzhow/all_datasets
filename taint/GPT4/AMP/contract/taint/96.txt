   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all the time and want to do it myself. I have heard that it can be hard, but I also heard it could be fun. What do you think? Is it worth it? And if so, how do I get started? Please help me!




I think it depends on your current level of experience with programming. If you're just starting out, I would recommend the official Python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. This tutorial will introduce you to the basic syntax and concepts of the Python programming language.

Once you have a basic understanding of Python, you can start exploring more advanced topics such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python: https: // docs. python. org/ 3 /tutorial /classes. html
 - Functional Programming in  Python : https : //docs.python.org /3.8/howto/functional.
