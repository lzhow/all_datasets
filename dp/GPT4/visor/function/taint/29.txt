The variable _ balances is a mapping of type address =>uint 2 5 6. It is defined in line 3 of the code. This means that it maps an address (which is an Ethereum address) to a uint 8.  The variable is private, which means only the contract itself can access it. Therefore, the value of _ balance is determined by internal logic of contract and not by user input.
