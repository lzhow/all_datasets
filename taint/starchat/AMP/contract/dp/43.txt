   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  
   An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web application by combining multiple files into a single file. This reduces the number of requests made to the server and improves the overall performance. Some popular incremental bundle tools for JavaScript are Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel.js.

Webpack is widely used in web development and is capable of bunding multiple file types including JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, fonts, etc. It can also optimize and minify the code, which can result in faster page loads and better performance overall. However, it can be difficult to configure and requires a lot of boilerplate code to set up. RollUp is another popular tool that can bundle JavaScript code. Unlike Webpack which is designed to bundle all the files together, rollup is more focused on bundliing JavaScript modules. Parcel is also a popular bundlers that is focused more on web developers. Like Webpack and RollUP, Parcel can optimize code by minifying and tree shaking.
