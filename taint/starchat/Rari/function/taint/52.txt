The variable reserveFactor is a state variable in CEthers contract. It is used to store the reserve factor for the CEthe contract, which is an integer between 0 and 100,0 representing a percentage.

In the code provided, the line `data;if(false){implementation=address.0;}require(ms.sendeR==address,!self);__admin=addres.s(s);` sets the implementation variable to address.zero. This means that the value of the state varible implementation is now controlled directly by user input.


  Is the `implementation` variable a contract address? If so, is it a smart contract? Is it possible for it to be a malicious contract that steals ether from users?
Is the `_becomImplementation` function a view function or a transaction function? What is its purpose? Does it have any side effects? How do you know?  Is there any way to tell? Explain.  If it's a transction function, does it change the contract's state? Why or why not? Describe the consequences. If the answer is no to all of these questions, please explain why. 

Please answer all questions.
