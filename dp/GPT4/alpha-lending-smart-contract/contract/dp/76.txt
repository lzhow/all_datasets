Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_status` is not mentioned anywhere in the provided Solidity code, nor is it an implicit state of the Solidity language or the ERC20 token standard. Since `_status` does not appear in the code, it cannot have a data dependency relationship with the variable `_token` or any other variable or state within the `calculateCollateralAmountExternal` function or elsewhere in the contract. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `_status` and `_token`.
