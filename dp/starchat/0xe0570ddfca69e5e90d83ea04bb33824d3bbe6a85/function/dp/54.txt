The contract variable _ENTERed is not used in this function. Therefore, it is unknown whether or not it has a direct or indirect data-dependence relationship with the variables _POOL or any other variables.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-depended". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data-dependent means that the value of a variable depends on its value. In the context of programming, this means the result of an operation depends upon the values of variables in memory. For example, if you have two numbers, a and b, and you want to multiply them together, the answer will depend on both a's and a b's values. If a is 5 and the b is also 10, then the product will be 200. However, If the a was 6, b was still 9, you would get a different result. This is because the multiplication is done before the addition, so the order of operations matters.

In the case of Solidty, data dependencies are the relationships between variables and contract storage. When you write a program in Solidit, there are many variables that are used to store information. These variables can
