  
The variable 'symbol' in function contructor is 'Unknown'.

This is because the symbol is passed as an argument to the constructor, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user who calls the contract's constructor. However, the value of the `name_`, `underlying_ `, `comptrollor_  ` and `interestrateModel_ are not directly controlled.
