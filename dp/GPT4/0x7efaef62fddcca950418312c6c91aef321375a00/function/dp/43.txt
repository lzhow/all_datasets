Reason: The variable `liquidity` in the `mint` function is calculated based on `amount0` and `amount1`, which are derived from `balance0` and `balance1` within the same function. These balances are the current token balances of the contract.

In the `swap` function, `balance1` is assigned the value of the contract's balance of `token1` after potentially transferring `amount1Out` to address `to`. This balance affects the contract's state, which is relevant for the next call to any function interacting with these balances, including `mint`.

Since `liquidity` in `mint` depends on the contract's balance of `token1` (referred to as `balance1` in `mint`), and `balance1` in `swap` represents a potential change to the contract's balance of `token1`, there is a data dependency relationship between `liquidity` in `mint` and `balance1` in `swap`. The `mint` function's calculation of `liquidity` will be affected by any previous calls to `swap` that alter the contract's `token1` balance.
