In this case, the `tryMUL` function is a library function that is part of the SaferMath contract. It is used to perform safe mathematical operations, such as addition, substraction, multiplication, and division.
However, there is no information in this code snippet to determine whether the input variable 'a' is user-controlled or not. Therefore, we cannot label it as 'Yes' or 'No'. It could be either controlled or uncontrolle by user, depending on how the contract is deployed and used.
