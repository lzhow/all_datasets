   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high- level and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python has become the language of choice for many people because it's easy to read and write, and it has a large and supportive community of users and developers. Its syntax is simple and straightforward, making it easy for new programmers to pick up and start using right away. Additionally, Python has many built-in modules and libraries that make it very easy and efficient to perform many tasks, such as working with files and networks, as well as accessing databases and using mathematical and scientific functions."
