Explanation:
In the `_do_swap` function, the `swap_data` struct contains the field `path`, which is an array of addresses representing the tokens in a swap path (e.g., [token0_address,token1_adress,...]). The `pair` variable is initialized to the address of the OrinMultiPollLibrary pair for the first two tokens of `token_pair`. The function then calls the swap function of this pair with the appropriate arguments.
Since the pair is a struct, it contains a field called `balances`, and the balance of token1 is stored in ` balances[  token_index +1 ]`.
Therefore, ` amount  out` is dependent on ` reserve_input` because ` reserves_in` and ` balance_out` are both stored as part of a pair struct.
