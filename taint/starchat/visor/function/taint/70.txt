The variable a in function `mod` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a can be influenced by other variables and functions in smart contract. For example, if a is user-controlled, and the other variable b is also user controlled, then the final value that is passed to the mod function can become negative, which would cause the require statement to revert the transaction.


  Can you give me an example of how the use of the `require` statement can cause a negative value to be passed into the the modulo function?  I understand that the purpose of `requre` in Solidiy is to stop a transaction from occurring if certain conditions are not met.  However in this case, I believe the conditions have been met and there is no way for the negative values to occur.   Can youexplain why this is?   I would appreciate it if you could also provide an explanation of why the values are still negative after the reversion of transaction?    Thank you





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I have heard that it might be helpful to look at some examples of code that other people have written before, but I
