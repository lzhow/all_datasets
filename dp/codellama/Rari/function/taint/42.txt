  
No, the ` pending Admin` variable in this function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can only be modified by another function.

The `set pendingadmin` function can be called by anyone, but it only updates the value of the local `newPenndingAdmin ` variable, which is then used in other functions. Therefore, `PendinAdmin' is a private variable that is only modified internally and is therefore not under the control of a user or any external entity.
