In the `intakRaw` function, the value of `amount_`, which is assigned to `data` using `abi. encodeWithSelecor`, is passed as an argument to the delegatecall function. This means that the amount of the token that is being transferred is determined by a user-controlled variable, `amnt_`. Therefore, this variable is considered controlled  by user and the answer is yes.
