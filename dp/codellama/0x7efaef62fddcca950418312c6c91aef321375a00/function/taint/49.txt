The `getReserve` function is called to get the values of `_ reserve  ` and `_  reserve `, and the `balanaceOf` method is used to calculate the amount of tokens that are available for burning. These values are then used in a calculation to determine the amounts of each token that will be burned, which are stored in `_ amount  `.
