Reason: The contract state `_totalPartitions` is data dependent on the variable `_fromPartition` in the function `_transferByPartition`. This is because `_fromPartition` is used to determine whether a partition needs to be removed from `_totalPartitions` in the case where the total supply for that partition becomes zero after a transfer operation. The relevant code that shows this dependency is:

```solidity
if (totalSupplyByPartition[_partition] == 0 && _partition != defaultPartition) {
    _removePartitionFromTotalPartitions(_partition);
}
```

Here, `_partition` is an alias for `_fromPartition` (as it is passed to the `_removeTokenFromPartition` function which in turn calls `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions`), and the function `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions` modifies the state variable `_totalPartitions` by potentially removing an element from it. Thus, there is a direct data dependency between `_fromPartition` and the state variable `_totalPartitions`.
