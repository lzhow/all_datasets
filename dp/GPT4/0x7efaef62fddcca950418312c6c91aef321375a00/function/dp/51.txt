Reason: The contract state `kLast` is assigned a value that is directly calculated using the variable `_reserve1`. This assignment occurs in the line `if (feeOn) kLast = uint(reserve0).mul(reserve1);`. The value of `kLast` depends on the multiplication of `reserve0` and `reserve1`, where `reserve1` is intended to be `_reserve1` (assuming there is a typo in the variable name and it should be `_reserve1` instead of `reserve1`). Since `kLast` is updated based on the result of this multiplication, there is a data dependency relationship between `kLast` and `_reserve1`.
