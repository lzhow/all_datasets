  
The variable borower in repyBorroweAllowd is a parameter of the external function. It is passed as an argument to the repaBowrAllow function and is therefore controlled  by a user of this function, not by this contract. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.

In general, any variable that is declared as a function parameter is considered to be controlled externally, and therefore not under the control of a smart contract, unless it has been explicitly marked as internal or private.
