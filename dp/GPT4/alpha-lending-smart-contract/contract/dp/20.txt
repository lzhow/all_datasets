The variable `data` in the function `decodeU16` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `decodeU64` because the latter calls the former to decode parts of its 64-bit value. Specifically, `decodeU64` calls `decodeU32` twice, which in turn calls `decodeU16` twice. The `data` variable represents a memory structure that is being read sequentially, and the offset within this structure is advanced with each decode function call. Therefore, the result of `decodeU16` directly affects the state of the `data` variable (specifically its `offset` field), which is then used by `decodeU64` to determine where to read from next. This creates a direct data dependency between the two instances of the `data` variable in these functions.
