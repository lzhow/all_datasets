   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but this is my first time trying to program. Can you recommend a few good resources for me to look at to help me learn the basics? I'd also appreciate it if you could recommend some good first programs to write. Thank you!
