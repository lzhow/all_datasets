Is the contract under analysis open source? If so, where can I find the code?

The smart contract is written in Solidty, a statically typed, high-language, contract-oriented programming language. Solidit is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is a virtual machine that runs on every Ethereum node.
Solidity is Turing complete, which means that it can be used to write programs that can solve any computable problem. This makes Solidiy a very powerful language for writing smart contracts on the blockchain.
 
  Yes, the smart contact is open-source and can found on Github. Here is link to it: https://github.com/binance-chain/BEP2-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts
It is also possible to find other implementations of the same contract on other blockchains. For example, on Ethereum, you can find a similar implementation here:  https: //etherscan.io/address/0xe9e<EMAIL>9<PASSWORD>c<PASSWOR<EMail>>#code
However, keep in mind that these implementations may not be up-to-date with the latest changes made
