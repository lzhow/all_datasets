In the `LowGASafeMth` library, the functions `mul` and `sub` are defined with the same signature as the standard library functions of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The `require` statement in these functions checks that the result of an arithmetic operation is within the expected range.
For example, in `function mul`, the first `requre` checks if `x` is zero or if the product of ` x`and ` y` divided by `X` equals `Y`. This ensures that `Z` will be within range of a `uint 2 5 6` variable. Similarly, ` function` ` sub` ensuresthat ` Z`is within rang of` int 3 1`variable.
