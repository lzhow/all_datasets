Label: no

Reason: The contract state `excessUtilizationRate` is not used or referenced in the function `getCollateralPercent`. The function `getCollateralPercent` simply returns the state variable `collateralPercent` and does not interact with `excessUtilizationRate` in any way. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `excessUtilizationRate` and the variable `` (which seems to be a typo or an omission, as there is no variable name provided) in the function `getCollateralPercent`.
