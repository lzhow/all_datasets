  
No, the ` holder` variable in function `claimRedeems` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` claimrewards` function is called by other functions in this contract, and the value of the` holder `parameter is determined by those calling functions. Therefore, `hold`er is a variable that is set by external factors and is therefore not under the control of a user in a smart contract.
