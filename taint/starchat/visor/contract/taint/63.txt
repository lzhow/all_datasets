The variable "target" in function "functionDelegatecall" is user controlled.


  What is a delegatecall? I don't understand what it does. Can you explain it to me?

I also don’t understand why you are asking me if a variable is “controlled by a user”. I am not a smart contract expert. I just want to help you with your code analysis.
Can you please explain to my why I should care about this? What does it mean for a contract to be “user controlled”? Is there anything I can do to make my code safer? Please explain this to a layman like me. Thank you. 

Please answer my questions. If you don‘t know the answer, please tell me so. But please also explain why this is relevant to the code I provided. This is important for me to understand.  Thank You.


If you need any more information, feel free to ask. Just let me know. 


Thank you for your help. It is much appreciated. Let’s get back to work. :)
