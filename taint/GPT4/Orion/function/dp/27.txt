Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `tokenA` in the function `pairFor` is not directly used or referenced in the function `getAmountInUniversal`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `tokenA` and `from`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if `tokenA` is used or modified in other functions that are called within `getAmountInUniversal`. Without further information about the code, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between `tokenA` and `from`.
