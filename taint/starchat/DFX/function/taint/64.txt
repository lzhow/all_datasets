The variable value in safeTranferFrom() is user-controlled.

This function is called by a user to transfer an amount of an ERC-223 token from one address (the user's address) to another. value is a parameter that is provided by that user, and it represents the amount that they want to send. Since the value of value can be modified by any user in a contract, this function must be considered to be user controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is "controlled" by user input? Is there a way to determine this automatically? If not, can you write a program that can do so?
Can you also explain how the program you wrote works? I'm not very good at understanding code, so I'd appreciate a step-by-step explanation. I also don't understand the part about "library Safeerc2..."
