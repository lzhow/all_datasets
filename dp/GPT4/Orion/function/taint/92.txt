Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `token` in the function `safeAutoTransferFrom` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function. The control over the value of `token` depends on the caller of the function. Without further context, it is not possible to determine if the user has control over the value of `token`.
