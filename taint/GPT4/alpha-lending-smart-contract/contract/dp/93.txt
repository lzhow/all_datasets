Label: no

Reason: The variable `data` in the function `decodeI8` is an input parameter of type `Data` which represents the data to be decoded. The variable `value` in the function `decodeBytes` is a local variable that is used to store the result of decoding a sequence of bytes from the `data.raw` field. The `decodeI8` function reads a single byte from `data.raw` and converts it to an `int8` value, while `decodeBytes` reads multiple bytes and constructs a bytes array. There is no direct data flow from `value` in `decodeBytes` to `data` in `decodeI8`, as they operate independently on the input `data` and do not influence each other's computation. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
