Explanation:
In the given code, the `require` statement checks if the new address is not the null address. If the condition is true, then the ownership is transferred to the address `address( newowner )`. The ownership transfer is done by assigning the value of ` newOwer` to `_ owner`. Therefore, `_Owner ` is data-dependent on `NewOwner`.
