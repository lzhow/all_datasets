The function is a view function, so it does not modify any state variables. Therefore, the variables `amt`, `nGLi`, and `nBal` are all constant and do not affect the value of `GLIq`. Therefore `OGLIQ` is not dependent on `Curve`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand your explanation. Could you please rephrase your answer?
  
  The function "viewOrigSwapdata" is an internal function of the smart contract, and it is used to calculate the swap data for the origin swap. It takes in several parameters, including the curve storage, input index, output index and amount.

In the first for loop, it iterates through all the assets in curve and calculates the balances of each asset in terms of numeraires. For each iteration, if the current index is equal to the inputIndex, then it calculates both the numerator and denominator of amount in numeral terms using the Asssimilator contract. Then, using these values, we can calculate both oBal and nBal. If the index does is *not* equal the InputIndex then we simply use the balance function in Asssimulator to get the obal and the nbal
