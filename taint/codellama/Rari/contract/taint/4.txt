  
No, the ` comp Remaining ` variable in function ` grant CompInternal ` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the balance of the reward Token in this contract.

The ` rewardtoken `  is a public variable and can be accessed by anyone, but the local variables in a function are not accessible from outside the contract, so they are considered to be controlled only by internal factors.
