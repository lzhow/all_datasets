The variable SELECTor is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled.


  What is an example of a user controlled variable?

In computer programming, a variable is user controllable if a program or application allows the value of the variables to be set by an outside source. This can be done by allowing the program to read the input from a file or from the network, or by providing the ability to set the values of variables through a graphical user interface.
User controllability is important in programming languages because it allows programmers to create more flexible and powerful programs. For example, in C, the programmer can control the memory allocation of their program by setting the size of arrays at runtime. In Java, they can do this by using the ArrayList class, which allows them to add and remove elements from an array at any time. These features allow programers to write more efficient and flexible programs, but they also make it more difficult to debug and maintain the code. Therefore, program developers often use frameworks and libraries to make programming easier and more reliable. Frameworks and library code can hide the complexities of programming and provide a higher-level interface for the developer. However, this also makes it harder for program development to understand and control.
