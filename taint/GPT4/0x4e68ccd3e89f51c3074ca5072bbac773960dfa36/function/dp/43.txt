Label: yes

Reason: In the given Solidity function `add`, the variable `z` is directly calculated from the expression `x + y`, which means that the value of `z` is dependent on the value of both `x` and `y`. The `require` statement also includes a comparison that involves `z` and `y`, further indicating that the value of `y` can affect the outcome of the condition. Therefore, `z` is data dependent on `y` within the context of the `add` function.
