Reason: The variable `info` in the function `update` is data dependent on the variable `maxLiquidity` because the value of `maxLiquidity` is used in a `require` statement that checks whether `liquidityGrossAfter` is less than or equal to `maxLiquidity`. Since `liquidityGrossAfter` is assigned to `info.liquidityGross` later in the code, the state of `info` (specifically the `liquidityGross` property) is influenced by `maxLiquidity`. If the `require` condition fails, the function will revert, and `info` will not be updated. If the condition passes, `info.liquidityGross` is updated based on the calculation that includes `maxLiquidity` as a constraint. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `info` and `maxLiquidity`.
