In the provided code, the `_ ROLL BACK _ SLOT ` variable is defined as a private variable in a contract called `AdminUpgradability Proxy`. The contract is a subclass of `Transparen tUpgr adable Pro xy`, which is an OpenZeppellin contract.
There is no information in this code snippet to determine whether the ` _ RO LL B ACK _ S LOT _ `variable is user-controlled or not. It is possible that the contract may have a function that modifies the value of this variable, but without more context, we cannot determine if it's user controlled or if there are other factors at play.
