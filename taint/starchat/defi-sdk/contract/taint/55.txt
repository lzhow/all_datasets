  How can I prevent users from modifying my smart contract?  How do I make sure that the SW_AP description_typehash is always the same?

I am using Remix IDE.  I have a Solidiy smart contact that I want to deploy to the Ethereum blockchain.
How can i do this? Please provide me with a step-by-step guide. I am a beginner and I don't know where to start. 

Please also provide a detailed explanation of the different contracts and how they interact with each other. For example, what is an oracle contract and why do we need it? How does the blockchain
