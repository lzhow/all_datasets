  
No, the variables ` balance 1 ` and `_ token â€‹0 ` are independent.

The reason is that the ` swap ` function is a separate function from the `_update` function, and the two functions do not share any variables. Therefore, any changes made to the value of ` _ token ` in one function will not affect the other function.
