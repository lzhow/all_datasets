  
No, the `_ token  ` variable in function `burn` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and it can't be modified by any external user, so it doesn' t have any user input.

The variable is assigned the value of `token ​​1`, which is a public variable of the contract, and its value is set when the constructor is called. Therefore, its initial value cannot be changed by an external actor.
