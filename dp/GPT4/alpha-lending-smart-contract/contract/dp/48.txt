The variable `totalAmount` in the function `getReleaseAmount` is data dependent on the variable `nextWeekBlock` within the same function. This is because `totalAmount` is calculated in a while loop that iterates based on the value of `fromBlock` and `toBlock`, and within this loop, `totalAmount` is updated using the value of `nextWeekBlock`. Specifically, the line:

```solidity
totalAmount = totalAmount.add(nextWeekBlock.sub(fromBlock).mul(tokensPerBlock[week]));
```

shows that `totalAmount` is being incremented by a value that is dependent on the difference between `nextWeekBlock` and `fromBlock`, multiplied by a value from the `tokensPerBlock` array indexed by `week`. Since `nextWeekBlock` is used in the calculation that updates `totalAmount`, there is a direct data dependency between these two variables.
