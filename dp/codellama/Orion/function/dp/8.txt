  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `require` statement in `funcionStaticcall` checks if the target address is a contract address. If it is not, it throws an error.
Then, in `_verifycallResult`, the success and retunrdata variables are used to determine if a call was successful.  The `success` variable is set to true if `staticCall` was called successfully, and `returnData` is returned from the call. In this case, `retrunData ` is data-dependent on ` target` because it depends on whether the staticcall was successfully executed. Therefore, we can conclude that ` retundata `is data dependendent on` target`.
