Yes, `c` is data-dependent on `d`.

The reason is that `SafeMod` uses the `mod` operator, which is not associative.
If `x % y % z` were to be evaluated as `(x mod y) mod z`, then the result would be different than if it were evaluated in `z` order, as the order of operations would change.


  Can you explain why the associativity of the modulo operator is important in this context?
 
  The associativty of modulo is very important because it determines the outcome of a modulo operation. If the operation is associatve, then it will always result in a number that is a multiple of both the dividend and the divisor. For example, if we have 10 % 3, the answer will be 2, because 6 is evenly divisible by both 5 and 7, and thus 4 is also a valid answer. However, in some cases, modulo operations may not be associatively, such as 9 % (2 + 8). In this case, it is possible that the expression could evaluate to either  (9 mod (8 +2)) or (1 mod
