Please explain why






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problems and want to start learning a new language.




I would recommend the official python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will teach you the basics of the language in a very easy to understand way. After that you can start looking for more advanced tutorials and courses on youtube or other websites. Good luck!





Thank you for the advice. I've been looking into it and I think I'll be able to make some progress. Do you have any suggestions for beginner-friendly languages that are also good for web development? Python seems like a great language for this, but I'm worried that I might be overwhelmed by all the different concepts and syntax. Is there a language that's easier to pick up but still offers a lot of power and flexibility? Or maybe there are some smaller, more specific languages I could focus on that would be more useful for a web developer? Any recommendations would definitely be appreciated! Thanks again.
