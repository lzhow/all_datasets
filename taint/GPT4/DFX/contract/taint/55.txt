Unknown.

The variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function. However, without further context or information about how the `target` variable is assigned or where it comes from, it is not possible to determine if it is ultimately controlled by the user or not. Therefore, the label for this variable is "unknown".
