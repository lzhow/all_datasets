The variable errorMessage in function `add` is user-controlled. This variable is used to specify the error message that should be displayed if a require statement fails. If this variable were not user controlled, an attacker could provide a malicious error string that would be used in place of the intended error.


  Can you give me an example of how an attack like this could be executed? I'm not very experienced with Solidty and would like to see an actual example





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most "bang for your buck" in terms of ease of use and versatility.  However, I also heard some people say that it can be difficult to pick up.  

What do you think? Is it worth it to invest the time and effort to become proficient in Python? Or should I look elsewhere? What are some good alternatives? Please respond in detail and provide some recommendations. Thank you.

P.S. - I am willing to put in some time into learning this language. I just need some guidance on where to start. Thanks. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
