Reason: The variable `canAdminOverwrite` is set during the construction of the `MasterPriceOracle` contract and can only be modified by the `admin` of the contract. The `admin` is also set during the construction of the contract and can only be changed by the current `admin` through the `changeAdmin` function, which is protected by the `onlyAdmin` modifier. This means that `canAdminOverwrite` is not directly controlled by a generic user, but rather by the designated administrator of the contract. Therefore, it is not user-controlled in the general sense, as only the specific privileged `admin` has control over this variable.
