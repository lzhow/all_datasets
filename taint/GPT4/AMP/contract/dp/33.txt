Yes

The contract state `_totalPartitions` is data dependent on the variable `_data` in the function `_transferByPartition`. The reason for this is that within `_transferByPartition`, the `_data` variable is used to determine the destination partition (`toPartition`) when calling `PartitionUtils._getDestinationPartition(_data, _fromPartition)`. If the destination partition is different from the source partition and the total supply for that partition becomes zero after the transfer, the `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions` function is called, which modifies the `_totalPartitions` array. Therefore, there is a data dependency because the contents of `_data` can influence the modification of the `_totalPartitions` state.
