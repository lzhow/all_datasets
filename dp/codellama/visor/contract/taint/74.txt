  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `tryMUL` function, the value of `a` is passed as an argument, and the result is stored in `c`. The value ` b`is not passed in as a parameter, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user input. However, since the multiplication operation is performed on ` a` and `  b`, the resulting value is dependent on the values of both variables. Therefore, ` c` can be considered as controlled indirectly by ` user` input, as the input values for ` ` and` b ` can affect the output value.
