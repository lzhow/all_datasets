No, they do not have semantic equality. Even though the codes produce the exact same result when executed, there is some subtle difference in the underlying implementation. In the `swap` function, for example, one code may use a ternary operator `?:` while the other uses an `if-else` statement, and the order of operations may be different in each case.
