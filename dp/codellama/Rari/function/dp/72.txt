  
The label is 'Unknown'.

There is no direct data dependence between the two functions. However, the `finishInteresAccural` function calls the internal function`checkPointInterst` which takes the parameter `borrowRateManitissa` as input. This parameter is calculated in ` getcshPriort` and passed to `checkPintInteret` through the ABI encoding. Therefore, ` simpleinteresFacor` is indirectly dependent on `cahPrio`.
