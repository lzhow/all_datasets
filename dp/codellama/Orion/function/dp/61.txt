  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `doSwapeTrohughOrinPool` function, the value of `amout_ spend_ base_ units` is calculated using the values of the variables `swap_data. amount _ spend` and `path [token_ index]`. The value `token _ index` comes from the input parameter `SwaptData` of type `IPoolFuntionality. Swap_ data`.
On the other hand, in `_ swapCurv`e function , the parameter of`input_ ind`is used to calculate the balance of a token in a pool.
Therefore, ` amount spend base units ` is data-dependent on ` input_ Ind ` because the calculation of  ` amout spend _ base _ units  is based on  the amount of tokens that are spent in  _ swapcurve ` function.
