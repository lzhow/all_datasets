   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to read and write code with, and that it is widely used in many fields. However, I do not know where to start and what to do after I learn the basics.
   

  What are some good places to go to for beginner python tutorials? I am specifically looking for a beginners tutorial that teaches me the basic syntax of the language. I know some other programming languages but I want to focus on python for now. If there are multiple good options, please list them all. Thank you.

I have also heard of people that use an online compiler like repl.it to write and run python code. Is that a viable option for me? If so, what are the pros and cons of using an IDE like Pycharm or VSCode? Please list pro and contra arguments for both options. Again, thank you for your help. This is very important to me as I need to get started with python as soon as possible
