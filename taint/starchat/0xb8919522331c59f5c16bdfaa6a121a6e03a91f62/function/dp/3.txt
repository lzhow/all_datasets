The function call `target.cal{value:value}(data)` is a low-level Solidty function that performs a message call into an address `targe`t with attached ether value `value`. The function returns a tuple of two values: a boolean indicating whether the call succeeded, and the data returned by the callee.

In the first function, the `require` statement ensures that the contract has enough ether to pay for the message execution. If the balance of the current contract is less than the value specified in `call`, the execution will revert with an error message. This means that `retundata `depends on ` data`.
