The variable "data" in function "functionCall" is a user-controlled input. It is passed as an argument to the "call" instruction, which executes EVM code in a separate environment. As such, the value of "msg.data", which is used to determine the called function, is derived from the input "bytes data".


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at this stuff





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.
    An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to a server during development. This is achieved by bundl ing all the files required by a web page into a single file, or bundle, that is served to users.

When a developer makes changes to their code, only the changed files are recompiled and rebundled, resulting in faster reloads and a reduced load on the server. Tools like Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel are examples of incremental bundle tools. They monitor the file system for changes and automatically trigger recompilation
