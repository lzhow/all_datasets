Reason: The variable `_kLast` in the function `_mintFee` is a local copy of the state variable `kLast` and is used to calculate liquidity fees based on the reserves and the last known state. On the other hand, the variable `_token1` in the function `swap` is a local copy of the state variable `token1`, which represents the address of one of the tokens in the liquidity pair. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `_kLast` and `_token1` within the given functions. `_kLast` is used for fee calculation and is not influenced by the token addresses or swap actions. `_token1` is used for transfer operations and swap logic, which is unrelated to the fee calculation logic where `_kLast` is used. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
