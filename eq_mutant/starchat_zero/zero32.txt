Yes, the codes provided are both semantic equivalent in their functionality and output. As the comments in the code explain, they both perform a quick sort on an array of integers. The only difference is that one uses a while loop with a post-decrement instead of a pre-increment. This affects the order of the comparisons in each iteration of both the outer and inner while loops, but does not affect the correctness of either code.
