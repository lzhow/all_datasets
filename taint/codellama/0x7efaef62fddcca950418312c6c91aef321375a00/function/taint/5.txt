  
No, the ` feeon` variable in function `_mintsFess` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is assigned a value based on the result of a function call to `IPanCakFactory.feeto()` which is a public function that returns the address of the fee recipient.

The `factory` address is set in line 42 of code, and it can be changed by anyone who has the ability to call the contract' s `setFactory()` function. However, this function is only accessible to the owner of contract, which means that only the person who deployed the smart contract can change the factory address. Therefore, ` factory` can not be controlled directly by a user, but it may be indirectly controlled through the actions of other users.
