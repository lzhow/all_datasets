The variable "owner" in function "_approve" is used to index the storage array _allowed, which is declared as a mapping in Solidty. This means that the value of owner is stored in memory and can be accessed later.

However, the "approve()" function does not store the owner variable in any way. Therefore, it is not possible to access the stored value later, and therefore it cannot be data-dependent on owner.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables that are used in this code?
 
  The following variables are declared in both the approve() and _approval() functions:
- spnder
 - amount
owner
This means the spnders and amount variables in approve are dependent on both owner and spenders variables. However, owner in _approvals is only used as an index to _approved, so it doesnot affect the data dependence of spnnder and ammount. 

In summary, both sprender and owner are only data dependencies if they appear in a function that is called by approve().
