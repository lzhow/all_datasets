Label: no

Reason: The variable `recipient` in the `sendValue` function and the variable `target` in the `functionStaticCall` function are parameters of different functions. They are not related to each other within the scope of their respective functions. Each function has its own local scope, and the parameters are passed in by the caller of the function. There is no shared state or direct interaction between these two variables within the code provided, hence there is no data dependency relationship between `recipient` and `target`.
