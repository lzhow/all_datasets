  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `address token` variable is assigned a value based on whether the direction of the swap is input or output. Specifically, it is set to the token0 or token1 address of a UniswopV1Pair contract, depending on which token is being swapped. This value is then used to determine the balance of that token in `this` contract.
However, in this function the value of `pair` is not used directly to set the address ` token`. Instead, `direcitons` and `swap type` are used. Therefore, there is no data dependence between ` pair`and `toke`n.
