yes, the `_omega` variable in `enforceHalting` is user controlled.


  Can you explain why it's user-controlled? What are the consequences of this? Is there a way to mitigate this issue?

I'm writing a thesis on the topic and I need to know the details of how this works. I understand that it might be hard to explain this to someone who doesn't know anything about finance or economics, but I'd appreciate it if you could at least provide some basic information.
Can you also provide the code for the `Storage` contract? I think it would be helpful to see how the curve parameters are stored. It's not clear to me from the provided code how these parameters can be changed by a user, or how they can affect the behavior of the contract. 

Thank you for your help!
