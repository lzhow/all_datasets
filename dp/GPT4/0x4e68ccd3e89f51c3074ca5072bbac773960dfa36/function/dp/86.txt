Label: yes

Reason: The variable `tickLower` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is used as a key to access the mapping `self`, which is a storage mapping of `Tick.Info` structs. The function `cross` also takes the same mapping `self` as an argument and modifies the `Tick.Info` struct associated with a given `tick` key. Since `tickLower` could potentially be the same key as `tick` used in the `cross` function, the data in `self[tickLower]` could be affected by the operations performed in `cross`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `tickLower` in `getFeeGrowthInside` and `self` in `cross` because the state of `self` at the index `tickLower` could be modified by `cross`, which would affect the values read in `getFeeGrowthInside`.
