  
The variable 'new Admin' in function 'changeProxy Admin is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the new Admin address is passed as an argument to the change proxy admin function, which means that it can be controlled or manipulated by a user who calls this function.

In the context of the smart contract, the address of a new administrator can potentially be changed by any user, including the current owner of this contract. This means the contract's ownership and control can change hands, and the ownership of other contracts or assets can also be transferred. Therefore, this variable is considered controlled and manipulable by users.
