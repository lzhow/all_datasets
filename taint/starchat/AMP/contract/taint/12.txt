  How can I check if a variable is user controlled? I want to know how to do it myself. I have a few thousand lines of code. Can you give me a list of steps I can follow to check it? Please include examples of how the code should look like for each step.

I want you to write a program that can do this automatically. If it takes more than a couple of minutes for you, please tell me so, but also write down what you did so far. 

Please also include a way to exclude false positives. For example, if you detect a loop, you can just skip it. But please make sure to document that you excluded it, so that others can update their exclusion list.  Please also make it clear how many false positive you have found and how you eliminated them. This will help me understand how good your tool is. Thanks!
