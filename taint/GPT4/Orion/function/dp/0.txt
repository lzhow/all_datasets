Explanation: The variable `y` in the function `get_y` is data dependent on the variable `amp` in the same function. This is because the value of `amp` is used to calculate the value of `Ann`, which is then used in the calculation of `c`. The value of `c` is further used in the calculation of `y` in the second for loop. Therefore, the value of `y` depends on the value of `amp`.
