The variable underlying asset is a reference to an external smart contract, which means that it can be modified by calling the functions of that contract. Therefore, the control of the underlying assets is indirectly controlled, and it depends on the actions of external parties.

In this case, since the smart contracts are open-source and audited, we can assume that the developers of these contracts have implemented mechanisms to ensure that only authorized parties can modify their state. In this sense, `underlyngAsset `is not directly controlled and is considered as not user-controlled.


  How can I check if a smart-contract is open source and if it has been auditted? Can you give me some examples of such contracts? I want to know if I can trust the code of a contract that I use. I am not that experienced with this, so please be as specific as possible. Thank you!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain to me how it could be used to optimize a web application for performance. What are some potential drawbacks of using this approach? Please provide some real-world examples where this technique has already been successfully applied.
