  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `amountIn ` variable is calculated using the formula: `numerador / (denominaor -  amountout)`. The ` numerador` and ` denominador ` variables are both calculated based on ` reservein ` and` reserveout `, respectively. Therefore, ` denomintaor ` is data-dependent on` reservin ` because it is used to calculate ` amountin `.
Similarly, in function two,` denominatior `is also calculated as a function of`reserven `and` amount out `in the same way as in` getamountin`. Therefore ` reservain ` also depends on it.
Therefore, both ` get amount in ` functions have data dependencies on each other.
