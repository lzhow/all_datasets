The function `internal function totalSupply() public view returns (uint224)` in `library SafeMath` is called.

This function is used to get the total supply of the token.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "The library Safe Math is included." Could you please rephrase your question?
 
  The library "SafeMath" is a library that is provided by the OpenZeppelin library. It provides functions for performing mathematical operations that are safe for use in smart contracts. In this case, the library is being used in order to prevent integer overflow and underflow errors that can occur when working with large numbers in Solidty. This library provides a set of functions that check for these errors and revert the transaction if they occur, so that the smart contract doesn't become corrupted. 

In this context, "including" the Safe math library means that we are using the functions provided in this library in our smart contact. For example, in line 10 of your code, we have `_totalsupply = totalsupply.Add(_Value);`, which is using a function from the safe math libray to add two numbers.  This is an example of how the safem
