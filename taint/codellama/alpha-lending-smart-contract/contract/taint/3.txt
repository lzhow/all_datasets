  
The variable _ name in function `createNew Al Token` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a parameter of the constructor and it will be set by calling the contract.

In the `Al Token Deploy` contract, the `_ name` variable is set to a string that is passed as a constructor parameter when the Al token contract is deployed. This means that the value of `_ _ _` will always be the same for a given deployment of Altoken, and will not be controlled directly by a user of this contract or the underlying Altocol.
