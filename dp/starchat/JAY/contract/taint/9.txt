The variable "value" in function "sell" is a controlled variable. It is used to determine the amount of Jay that is being sold. Since the "msg" variable is defined as "payable", the value of "amount" can be modified by calling the sell function with a different value, which can result in a loss of funds for the owner of the contract.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiy





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

In combinatorial mathematics, a J-P-Perm P LL algorithm is any algorithm that solves the JP Permutation Puzzle (JPPP) in polynomial time. JPPPs are combinatory puzzles that resemble the well-known Rubik's Cube.
J-PP-Permutation puzles are NP-hard problems, and thus no efficient algorithm can solve all J PP Puzzels. However, many J Permutations P P L problems are reducible to J - P-perm P UL problems. In other words, there are many algorithms that can efficiently solve J permutation pazzles, but only a few that solve the
