Label: no

Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` and the variable `target` in the function `functionDelegateCall` are parameters of two separate functions. They are not related to each other within the scope of their respective functions. Each function has its own local scope, and the parameters are passed in by the caller of the function. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `account` and `target` as they are used independently within their own function scopes. There is no code in the provided Solidity contract that establishes a data dependency between these two variables.
