The variable `amountInWithFee` in the function `getAmountOut` is directly calculated from the variable `amountIn` within the same function. The line `uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * 997;` shows that `amountInWithFee` is dependent on `amountIn` because it is derived by multiplying `amountIn` by a constant (997). Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `amountIn` and `amountInWithFee`.
