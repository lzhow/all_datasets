The Soliditiy code for the transfer function is as follows:

function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) public virtual returns(bool){
    _balances[msgSender()] -= amount;
    balances[recipient] += amount
    emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    return(true);
}
In this function, the balances mapping is data-dependent on both the sender and recipient variables. This means that if either of these variables changes, so will the other.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. If you could give me some advice on where should I start, it would be really helpful. Thank you!
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I'm a beginner and I'd like to create a website for my school project. What IDE should i use? What libraries should my project use, and how do I install them? Please be as specific as possible. Thanks!
I'm also open to other languages, if that
