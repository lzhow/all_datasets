In the `mulScalartruncate` function, the parameter `scalar` is passed by value, which means it is a separate copy of the original variable. Therefore, `product` and `n` are independent variables and do not have any data dependencies.
On the other hand, in `saf2e2`, the argument `string memory` error message is not used in any way, so it does not affect the behavior of `truncated`. Therefore the variables `err`and ` product` do have data dependence.
