The function "observe" in your code has a return statement that assigns the values of the variables "tick" and "secondsPerLquidity" to the memory locations "returnTick"and " returnSecondsPerLiquididy". The function calls the "observations" contract, which has the functions "initialize" (which assigns values to "observationindex", " observationcardinality", "ObservationCardinalitynext" "feeprotocol"  and"unlocked") and the view function" observe".

In the initialize function, the value of "sqrtpriceX 9 6" is assigned to a variable called "price" of type "uint25 4". In the observe function, the array " secondsAges"is passed as an argument to an array of uint2 54 type.
However, there is no direct assignment of values from one function to another. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the two functions have data dependencies or not.


  Can you explain how I can determine if the code I am reviewing has data-dependent variables?
 
  Data-dependence is a complex concept that can be difficult to define precisely, but it generally refers to how one variable or value in a program depends on another
