No, the codes provided are **not semanticually equal**. While the mutant code does produce the exact same result when executed, it does so by modifying the original array rather than creating a separate copy. This is because the `++` operator is a **side effect** and **modifies the value** of the variable being operated upon. In the provided example, this means that the modified array will be used when printing the final array values, which will have unexpected consequences if these values are intended to remain unchanged.
