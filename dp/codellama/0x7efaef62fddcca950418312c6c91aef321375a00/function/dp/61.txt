The variable _ reserves 1 is not dependent on token in _ safeTransfers. This is because the _ safetransfer function does not use the token variable. Instead, it uses the abicall function to call the selector function, which is a different function. Therefore, the data in token is irrelevant to the calculation of _ reserve 2.
