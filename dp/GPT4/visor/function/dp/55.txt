yes

The variable `_balances[sender]` in the function `transferFrom` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `_transfer`. This is because the value of `_balances[sender]` is directly modified based on the `amount` that is being transferred. In the `_transfer` function, `_balances[sender]` is decreased by the `amount` specified in the function call (`_balances[sender].sub(amount)`), and this operation is part of the logic executed within the `transferFrom` function when `_transfer` is called. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `_balances[sender]` and `amount` as the state of `_balances[sender]` is affected by the value of `amount`.
