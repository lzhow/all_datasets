yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_mintfee` function uses the `sqrt` and `mul` functions on `_reserve` variables, which depend on `token` state variables. Therefore, the two are dependent on each other.


  Can you explain why it's data-dependent?
 
  The reason why ` rootklast` is data dependant on token 1 in ` burn` method is because the calculation of ` liqudity` depends on it. `liqudiity = (totalsupply * (sqrt (reserve  * reserve) - sqrt (k last * k last)) * 8)  / ( sqrt(k *k) *16 + sqrt((k-1)* ( k- 2))  )`

 
 


  What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I have heard that there are many online courses but I do not know which ones are the best. Could you recommend some good ones for a beginner?
