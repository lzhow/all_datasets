  
The answer is 'Yes'.

In the `update` function, the value of `info` is updated based on `liqudity_delta` and `max_liquuidity`. The `clear` method is called to delete the entry in `self` for `tick`.
Then, in  the  `getFfeGroth`function, `lower`and `upper` are used to calculate the fee growth inside the tick range.
Finally,  In the`cross`method,`info`,`feegrowthexternal0x1x2`, `fegrotheexternal1`, and`secondsperliquideitycumulativx`are used.  The`liquitynet` variable is also updated.
