  
The variable 'success' in function 'getProxyAdmins' is a local variable and is therefore not directly controlled or manipulated by a user in this contract. It is set to the result of a call made to a static function of the 'TransparantUpgrateableproxy' contract, which is an external contract and therefore cannot be controlled directly by users.

Therefore, the answer is 'No'.
