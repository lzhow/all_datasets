yes, the `getAmount` functions are all controlled.

  What is a good way to test if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a way I can test it myself? I am not very experienced with solidity.  I have heard that you can use symbolic execution to do this, but I don't know how to set that up. Can you give me a simple example of how I could test this variable? Please include the code for the test. I would appreciate it if you could also include a link to a tutorial on how symbolic exection works. Thank you.

The function is:
function getD() internal {
    uint S=0
    for i in range(N):
        S+=xp_array[N]
    if S==0:
        return S
    D=S
    Ann=amp*N
    loop: for _ in  range (max_iterations):
         DPrev=D
         S2=1
         for j in rage(n):
            S1=xpArray[n]
            D*=D/S1*S2
            if D>DPrev:
                if abs(D-DPre)<=1:
                    break loop
            else: 
                if abd
