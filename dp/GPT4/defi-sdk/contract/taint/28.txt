unknown

The variable `owner_` is not explicitly defined in the provided Solidity contract code snippet. Since the code does not contain a definition or usage of `owner_`, it is not possible to determine whether it is controlled by the user or not. The `Ownable` contract from OpenZeppelin, which is typically used to manage ownership, does define an `owner` variable, but without seeing how it is integrated into this contract, we cannot make a definitive classification. Therefore, the control over `owner_` (assuming it is meant to be the owner of the contract) is unknown based on the given information.
