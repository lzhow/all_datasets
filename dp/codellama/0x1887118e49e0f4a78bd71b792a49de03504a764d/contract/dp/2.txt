The contract variable 'admin' is a state variable that is declared in line 21 of the code. It is assigned a value in lines 30-31, and it is updated in function 'change admin' in 40, 50 and 60 lines. However, the 'new admin ' variable is only used in this function to update the value of ' admin'. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
