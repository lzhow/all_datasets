The variable `input` in the function `cancelAccountSignature` is data dependent on the variable `amountType` in the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount`. This is because `cancelAccountSignature` calls `validateAndExpireAccountSignature`, which in turn calls `hashAccountSignatureData`. The `hashAccountSignatureData` function is not shown in the provided code, but it is likely to use the `input` parameter as part of the data it hashes. 

Furthermore, `validateAndExpireAccountSignature` is also called by the `execute` function, which subsequently calls `getAbsoluteInputAmount`. The `getAbsoluteInputAmount` function takes `input.tokenAmount` as a parameter and uses `amountType` to determine how to calculate the `absoluteTokenAmount`. Since `input` is used in a call chain that leads to a function where `amountType` influences the outcome, there is a data dependency relationship between `input` and `amountType`.
