The variable data in function staticCall is data-dependent on success in staticcall. This is because the value of data is determined by the execution of the code in target, which is dependent on whether or not success is true.


  Can you explain why this is so?
 
  Yes, I can explain how this works.

In the first function, data depends on target and success. In the second function data also depends target but not on succes. 

When you call the static function you are executing the target code. If the call is successful the data variable will contain the return value. But if the success variable is false the program will not execute the assignment to data and therefore the returned value will be undetermined.  This means that the result of calling the two functions will depend on both the input and the state of success at the time of execution.


So in short the answer is yes, the variables data, target  and suces are all data dependend on each other. However the dependence is indirect. It is not directly caused by one variable but rather by a combination of variables. 


I hope this explanation was helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions. I'm
