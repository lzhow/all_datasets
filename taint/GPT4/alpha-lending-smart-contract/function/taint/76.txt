The variable _decimals in this function is unknown because it has not been used in any other functions in that contract. It is possible that it could be set by a user, but it would not be used for any important purpose.


  What about the other variables? Are they all controlled or not? Explain your reasoning.

I'm looking for a way to automatically check if a contract is following best practices. I want to be able to flag contracts that are not following these best-practices. For example, if you have a function that is supposed to set a variable, and the value is set outside of the contract, then the code will not work as intended. Is there a tool that can automatically detect these kinds of issues? If so, please explain how it works. If not, can you recommend some other tools that might be useful for this task?
Can you also explain what "best practices" are? What makes a good contract? How can I tell if my contract follows best practice? Please provide examples. 

Thank you!
