In the first function, the `sender` variable is passed as an argument to the `_transer` function. This function modifies the state of the contract by transferring the amount of tokens from the sender's account to another account.
Similarly, in function 2, `amount` is also passed to `_approves` as a parameter. `_allowance` also modifes the allowances of `msg.sender`.
Therefore, both ` sender` and ` amount` are dependent on ` recipients` because they both modify the same state.
