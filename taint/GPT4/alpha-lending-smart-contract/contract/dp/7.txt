Label: no

Reason: The function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmountExternal` is marked as `external` and `view`, which means it does not modify the state of the contract. It takes two parameters, `_token` and `_amount`, and returns the result of calling another function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount`. There is no direct interaction with the `pools` state variable within this function. The `pools` state variable is not read or modified in the process of executing this function, and thus there is no data dependency relationship between `pools` and `_token` within the context of `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmountExternal`.
