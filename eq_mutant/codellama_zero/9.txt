  
Semantic Equality: No
Explanation:
In the original code, `t` stores the value of `a` before it is modified by the `--a`. In the mutated code ` t= --a`, ` -- a` modifies the ` a ` variable before assigning it to `  t`. This means that the values of the variables ` x ` and ` y ` are different in the first code and the second code. Therefore the codes do not have semantic equality.
