Yes, `getTotalBorrowShare` is data-dependent on `compoundBorrowBalace` because it is used to calculate the value of `poolLiqudity` and `availableLiquidity`.


  Can you explain how the code works?
 
  Sure! The code in question is a Solidty function that calculates the total borrow shares and total liquity of a given pool in a lending protocol.

The function begins by declaring a local variable called `Pool` that is initialized to the pool object for the given token. This object is stored in memory at the address `address(token)`. The function then assigns the `altokenAddress` variable the the memory address of the ALToken contract associated with the current pool, and assigns `pooldConfigAddres` the same for its associated PoolConfig contract. It then calculates and sets the values of several variables, including `lastUpateTimestamp`, `status`, and the various totals.



   Can I use this code? If so, how? Can it be used for free? Is there a limit to how much I can use it for? How do I get access to it? What are the requirements for using it, such as a certain
