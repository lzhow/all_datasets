The function `JAYtoETH` is not defined in the given code, but assuming it returns a value based on some calculation involving `value`, it can be inferred that the value of `eth` is dependent on the value of `value`. \n\nOn the other hand, the variable `_price` in the function `updateFees` is assigned the value of `uint256(price).mul(1 * 10**10)`, where `price` is an `int256` variable returned by the `latestRoundData()` function of the `priceFeed` contract. The value of `price` is not directly dependent on any variable or state in the `sell` function. However, it is possible that the value of `price` is dependent on some external factors that are not visible in the given code, in which case the data dependency between `eth` and `_price`"

Specifically, if `_price` is greater than `USD_PRICE_SELL`, then `_sellNftFeeEth` is calculated as `uint256(1 * 10**18).div(_p)`, where `_p` is `_price` divided by `USD_PRICE_SELL`. Otherwise, `_sellNftFeeEth` is calculated as `USD_PRICE_SELL.div(_price)`. Finally, the value of `sellNftFeeEth` is set to `_sellNftFeeEth`. Therefore, the value of `sellNftFeeEth` depends on the value of `_price`."
