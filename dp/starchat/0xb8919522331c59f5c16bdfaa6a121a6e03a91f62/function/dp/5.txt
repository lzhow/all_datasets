The function call `success =  target. call {value:value} (data)` is a low-level Solidty function that executes a message call into an address. It takes two parameters: the address of the contract to call and the data to send.

In the first function, the target contract is called with the value of `value` and `data`. The function then checks if the call was successful by checking the `succes` variable. If the success variable is true, it then assigns the return data from the called contract into the memory location ` returnData`.
If the second function is executed, then the program will first check if there is enough ether in `address (this)` to pay for the transaction. Then, `iscontract (target)` will be checked to ensure that the targeted contract exists. After this, a new message will call the specified contract with ` value` as the amount of ether to be sent.
