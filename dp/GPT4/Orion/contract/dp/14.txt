No, the variable `amountIn` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `output` in the function `_swap`. 

The variable `amountIn` is assigned the value of `amounts[i + 1]` in the `_swap` function, which is determined by the `amounts` array. The `amounts` array is passed as an argument to the `_swap` function and its values are calculated outside of the `_swap` function. The variable `output` is used within the `_swap` function to determine the value of `amountOut`, but it does not directly affect the value of `amountIn`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
