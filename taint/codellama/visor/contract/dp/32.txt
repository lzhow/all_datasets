In the constructor function, the `_msgSend()` function is called to get the address of the sender of a message. This address is then assigned to the private variable `_sender`. The `_ownership` function then uses the `owner()` method to return the current owner of this contract.
Since the value of `_send` is used to set the initial value for `_ownder`, the two are dependent on each other. Therefore, we can conclude that the data is dependent between the variables `_sned` and `_ower`.
