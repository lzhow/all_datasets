  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `_add_liquidty` function, the `token_or_Weth` variable is assigned the value of `address (0)` if the token is not supported by the pool. This means that the address of the Weth token will be used as the input token in place of any unsupported token.
Then, in `_ swapCurves`, the` input_Ind`, `output_ Ind`, and `pool` variables are assigned values based on ` cur_Factory`,` token_Or_weth`,and ` token`.
Therefore, ` input _Ind ` is data-dependent on` cur _Factory`.
