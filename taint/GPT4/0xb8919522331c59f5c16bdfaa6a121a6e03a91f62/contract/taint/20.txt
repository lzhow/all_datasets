Label: yes

Reason: The variable `newAdmin` in the function `changeProxyAdmin` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function can be called by any user who has access to the contract interface and knows how to interact with it, the value of `newAdmin` is indeed controlled by the user who calls the function. However, it's important to note that the function `changeProxyAdmin` is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that only the owner of the contract (as determined by the `Ownable` contract logic) can successfully execute this function and change the admin. Despite this restriction, the input `newAdmin` is still provided by the user who must be the owner or have control over the owner's account.
