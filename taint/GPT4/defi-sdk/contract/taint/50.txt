Label: no

Reason: The variable `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is not explicitly defined in the provided Solidity contract code. However, based on the context and the naming convention, it seems like `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` would be a constant related to EIP-712, which defines a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data. If it were defined in the contract, it would likely be a constant hash value that represents the specific structure of a permit message to be signed, and it would not be controlled by the user. Constants in Solidity are set at compile-time and cannot be modified by users of the contract. Therefore, any variable like `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` that represents a type hash for a permit would not be user-controlled.
