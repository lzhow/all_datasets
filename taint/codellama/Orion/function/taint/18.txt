  
No, the ` reserve B` variable in function `_add liquidty` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameters `amount A desired` and ` amount B desired`.

The ` _ add liquidtiy` function calculates the optimal amount of tokens to be added to the liquiditiy pool based  on  the current reserves of the pool. It does not take any user input. Therefore, ` reserver B ` is a calculated value and not a user-controlled variable.
