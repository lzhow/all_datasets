The variable vestingAlph is a local variable in function `giveAlpahToAlphaToken` and it's not a user-controlled variable. It' s a temporary variable that is used to store the amount of alpha tokens that will be transferred to the alToken contract. Therefore, the value of vestinAlpha is determined by internal logic and is under the control of the contract, not the users.
