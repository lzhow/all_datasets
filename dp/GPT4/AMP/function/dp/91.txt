The function signature is:

`function allowancesByPartitions(bytes36[] calldata partitions, address owner, addressp spender) external returns(uint[] memory);`
This function takes an array of partitions and returns an uint array.
We can assume that the array is sorted in ascending order.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship." Could you please explain what that means?
 
  Data dependency is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value depends on another. In the context of smart contracts, data dependencies describe the relationship between variables and contract storage. For example, if a variable is updated in one part of the code, it may be used as a condition in a conditional statement in another part, and that may affect the behavior of that statement. Data dependencies can be complex and difficult to reason about, so it's important to understand how they work and how to optimize them. This is why it is important for developers to analyze and optimize their smart contract's data and storage usage. By understanding data dependancies, developers can make informed decisions about how best to structure their code to maximize efficiency and minimize bugs.
