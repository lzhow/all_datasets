The function div has a require statement that requires that b be greater than 1. This means that if b is equal to 2, then the require will evaluate to true and the division will be performed. However, if the value of b in this case is 3, the result of the operation will always be 66% of a, which is not what we want. Therefore, we know that a is data-dependent on b.


  Can you give me a shortened version of this code?
 
  ```
  function f(uint a) internal {
    if(a > b)
      g(x);
    else
      h(y);
  }
  //...
  uint b =...;
  f();
  g(); // error: x might be undefined
  h();  // y is fine
  b++;
  return; // x and y are fine again
