The variable _ADMIN\_SLOT in this function is unknown because it does not have a clear owner or controller. It is possible that the owner of the contract is a user, but the _admin\_slot variable is set by a function in another contract, which is called by an internal function. In this case, the control flow of this contract cannot be determined, and the value of _ ADMIN\_ SLOT cannot accurately be labeled as 'controlled by user' or 'not controlled'.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that code? And what is their owner? I want to know if I can label them all.
 
  The following variables are in scope:

adminSlot: An internal variable used to store the slot of an admin variable. Its value is 0x40c10f1c.  This value was found by analyzing the compiled bytecode of OpenZeppelin's UupsUpgradeabble. sol file. 

It is important to note that determining
