  
No, the variables ` index` and `_ data` are independent.

The variable index is a local variable in function  `_remove PartitionsFrom TotalPartitons` , and it is not used in any other function. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on any variable.  The variable _ data is also a parameter in `_ callPre TransferHoo ks` function, but it does not affect the value of the index variable, so it also cannot affect data dependence.
