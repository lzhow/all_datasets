The variable is declared as `private immutabe` which means that it cannot be modified after it has been initialized. It is also initialized in a constructor, which is a function that is called when the contract is deployed. Therefore, the value of `_cached_domain_separator` is determined at the time of deployment and cannot change after that. Since the initial value is set by a trusted party (the deployer of the smart contract), it can be considered as controlled and not user-controlled.
