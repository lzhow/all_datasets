There is no direct data dependence between the `uint245` variable ` totalSuppplyByParition ` and the `_ value` parameter in function ` _ callPretransferhooks `. However, the value of `fromParititionprefix` is determined by the partition prefix of `_frompartition` and is used to determine the address of the validator contract. If the validation fails, then the transfer will not be executed, and therefore the total supply will remain unchanged.
However, it is not possible to say for certain whether the state of total suppply by partition is data-dependent on `_valu` without further analysis.
