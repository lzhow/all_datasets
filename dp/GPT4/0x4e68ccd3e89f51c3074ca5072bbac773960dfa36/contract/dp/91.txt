Yes

The variable `tick` in the function `getSurroundingObservations` is data dependent on the variable `target` in the function `observeSingle` because `target` is used to determine the time frame for which the observations are relevant, and `tick` is used within `getSurroundingObservations` to calculate the transformed observation when the `target` timestamp does not match an existing timestamp in the observations array. Specifically, if the `target` timestamp falls between two observations, `tick` is used in the `transform` function to interpolate the observation at the `target` timestamp. Thus, the value of `tick` affects the outcome of the observation transformation, which is dependent on the `target` time being sought.
