The function call `target.function(value)` is a low level call and can have side effects.

If `data` contains a reference to `msg.value`, then the call will also transfer value.


  What is data dependence?
 
  Data dependences are relationships between variables that are determined by the values of those variables. For example, if variable A is equal to variable B, then variable C must also be equal. This relationship is known as a dependance. Data dependencies can be used to optimize code by reducing the number of instructions required to compute the result. They can also help to avoid redundant computations. However, it is important to note that data dependencies are only a part of the optimization process. It is also important for the code to be correct and to have the desired behavior. In some cases, the data in a variable may be modified by other parts of code, and therefore, a dependency may not be apparent. Additionally, some data may depend on other data that is not known at compile time, which makes it difficult to determine the exact data requirements. Therefore, in some instances, determining data relationships may require manual analysis. Finally, there may also exist data structures that cannot be optimized, such as
