Label: unknown

Reason: The provided Solidity code snippet does not contain enough information to determine whether the contract state `borrowIndex` is data dependent on the variable `error`. The function `redeemInternal` calls `accrueInterest()`, which sets the `error` variable, but without the implementation details of `accrueInterest()`, it is impossible to know if `borrowIndex` is affected by or related to the `error` variable. Additionally, the `redeemFresh` function is called, but again, without its implementation, we cannot determine if `borrowIndex` is involved. Therefore, the data dependency relationship between `borrowIndex` and `error` cannot be established with the given information, and the label is 'unknown'.
