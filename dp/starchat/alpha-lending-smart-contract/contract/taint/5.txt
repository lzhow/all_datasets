The variable _ amount in function_ transfer is a control variable that is used to calculate the amount of Alpha rewards that will be distributed to users.

However, based on the contract's functionality, the use of this variable is likely to be controlled.


  How can I check if a contract has a bug? I'm not very good at coding, so I don't know how to check it myself. Can you help me with that? Can I use a tool to do that for me? Or do I have to look for other ways to find bugs? Please help!
 
  There are several ways you can check for bugs in a smart contract:

1. Static analysis: A static analysis is performed on a Solidty contract to identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities. A popular tool used for this is Slither, which can be used through the command line or as a plugin for popular code editors.

2. Fuzzing: Fuzzer is software that generates random inputs to a program and checks
