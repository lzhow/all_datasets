  
No, the ` to` variable in function `safeAutoTranfer` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` safe AutoTranserTo` function takes in three parameters: `wet`, `token`, and `value`. The ` token` parameter is a contract address, and the` value`parameter is an amount of tokens to transfer.  The` to `parameter in this function represents the recipients address. This parameter cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it must be passed as an argument to the  function. Therefore, this variable is labeled as 'No' because the value is determined by an external factor and cannot  be directly controlled or manipulated by users.
