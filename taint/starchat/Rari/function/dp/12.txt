The answer is no.

`cashPluBorrrowsMinReservse` is not a variable in either of these functions, so it cannot be a dependency.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the variables `totalBorows` and `add_( totalReservers,add_ (totalAdmFees, totalFees))` are dependent on `exchangeRate`.
 
  The answer to this question is yes. `CashPlusBrows` depends on both `TotalBorow` (which is modified by the `_seComptroler` function) and the `Exchange Rate` variable. This means that if either `Exchage Rate`, `ToTalBorrw` or `Add_(TotalReserver, Add_(ToatalAdmFees, TotalFees)` changes, then `CachPlusBorrow` will also change. 

This is because the calculation of `ChasPlusborrows ` involves multiple variables, and changing any one of them will cause the final result to change, which is a dependent variable of the two. Therefore, the answer for this quesiton is Yes. If you have any more questions, please let me know. Good luck!
