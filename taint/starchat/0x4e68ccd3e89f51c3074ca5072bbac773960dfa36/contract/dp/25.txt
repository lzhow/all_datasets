Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python was created in  the late 80s[1] by Guido van Rossum,[2] and first released on February 4, ,1991. Python's design principles are grounded in Dutch Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first version of the BCPL programminglanguage and the concept of structured programming. Guidovans Rosslum is often credited as the "Benevolent Dictator for Life"[3] of Python, as he remains actively involved in its development. Van Rossonum later founded the Python Software Foundation to promote and protect the language's future.[4]
Guido Rochlist discusses the creation of python in his document Python Manifesto.[5]
