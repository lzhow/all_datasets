The variable "left" in function "lessThan" is a Exp struct, which contains a uint member "mantisa". The "user" can control the value of "manitssa" by calling the "add" function.


  How can I check if a variable is user controlled? I want to know how to do that automatically. I don't want a human to look at the code. Can you write a program that does that for me? Please write it in Python. If it's too hard for you, please tell me how I can do it manually.

Here is an example of a Solidty function that takes a user input:
`function transfer(address recipient, uin256 amount) public returns(bool)`
How can you check that the recipient address is indeed a valid Ethereum address? You donâ€™t want any malicious user to be able to send ether to an invalid address. How do you do this automatically?
Please write the Python program in a way that can be easily integrated into a larger program. For example, you can make a function in your Python script that calls the web3.py library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This way, the larger Python application can
