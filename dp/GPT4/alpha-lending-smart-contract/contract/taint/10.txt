Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_token` in the function `burnAlToken` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is part of the contract's interface and can be called by external users or contracts. Therefore, the caller (which is typically a user or another contract acting on behalf of a user) has control over the value of `_token` that is passed to the function.
