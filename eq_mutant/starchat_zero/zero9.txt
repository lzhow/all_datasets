The two provided codes will produce the exact same result when executed. It is important to note that semantic equivalence is not the only consideration when evaluating code for equivalency. For example, syntactic equivalance might be more important, or perhaps the evaulation order of instructions should not matter, etc. Furthermore, depending on the application domain, other factors, such as performance, memory usage, code size, and so on, might also be important. Ultimately, the right answer to this question depends on one's specific evaluation criteria and the context of the code under consideration.
