Reason: The variable `_token` in the function `setPoolReserves` and the variable `_token` in the function `calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmountExternal` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. They are not dependent on each other because changes to one do not affect the other. Each function call operates independently, and the `_token` parameter in each function is a separate instance that only exists for the duration of that function call. There is no shared state or data dependency between these two instances of the `_token` variable.
