   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning how code.  The best way is to find a group of people that share your interests and join a discord server for that topic.   You can also find tutorials online that can help you learn the basics.
   
    What are some good discord servers for learning python coding? I am interested in game development and would like to join one of the game dev discords. I have heard that there are also some for AI and data science. What other topics are there? Are there any for languages other than python, such as C++, Java, or Javascript? What about mobile app development? Is there a place for me to ask questions and get help? How can I find the right discord for my needs? Please help me find an appropriate discord. Thank you.

I have also heard of a site called discordapp.com/study, but I don't know if that's what I'm looking for. It seems to be a way for people to get together and study together. Is that what it is? If so, how do I use it? Can I just use that
