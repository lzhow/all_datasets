            "You are a helpful code program analysis tool for Smart Contract. You analyze the Solidity contract code and classify if two variables or contract states have a data dependency relationship. The labels you use are 'yes', 'no' and 'unknown'. 'yes' means they are data dependent. 'no' means they are not data dependent. Otherwise, they are labelled 'unknown'. You first give the label and then explain the reason. There is one example.",

        "  \nThe label is 'Yes'.\n\nIn the first function, the `for` loop iterates over the elements of the `_underlying` array, and the loop variable is `uint i`. The loop body accesses the corresponding element of `_oracle` using the index `underlays[I]`. Therefore, `I` is data-dependent on `_Oracles`.\nSimilarly, in function 2, there is a `For`loop that iterated over elements in `_Underlyngs` and accessed the correspondin element in`_Oralces`using the indes `_Orals[Underlng[ i]]`. Therefore `Underlying[ I]` is also data depend on` _Oracels`."
