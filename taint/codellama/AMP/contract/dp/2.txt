  
No, the variables ` recipientsImplemenation` and ` to PartitionsPrefix ` are independent.

The variable `_recipietImlementation ` is assigned the result of the ` interfaceAdr ` function, which takes the address of ` _ to ` as an argument. This function returns the implementation address for the interface ` I A mp Tokens Recipients ` at the specified address. However, this implementation is not dependent on `  toP artitionP refix `, as the value of this variable is determined by the partition prefix of `_toP arition ` and not by ` t oP a r tition P ref ix `.
