  
No, the `_ amount` variable in function `_transer` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The `_ transfer` function takes three parameters: `_from`, `_to`, and `_amout`. The `_ amout` parameter is a value that is passed to this function when it gets called. It is therefore not a variable that can be controlled directly by a user, but rather a fixed value passed as an argument to a specific function call.
