Label: yes

Reason: The variable `tokenB` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is data dependent on the variable `amountAMin` in the function `_addLiquidity`. This is because the value of `tokenB` is used as an argument in the function `_addLiquidity`, and the value of `amountAMin` is used as an argument in the same function. The value of `amountAMin` affects the execution of the function `_addLiquidity`, which in turn affects the value of `tokenB`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
