Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the current block timestamp is less than or equal to the dead line. If it is not, then the transaction will be reverted.
However, in this case, it does not matter if `block timestamp` is greater than `deadline` because the `_nonce` will not be incremented and the approval will also not occur. Therefore, ` structhash` and ` value` are independent.
