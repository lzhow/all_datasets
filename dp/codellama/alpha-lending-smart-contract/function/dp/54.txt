In the `getUserCompondedLiuqidtyBalace` function, the `_user` variable is passed as an argument to the internal `balaceOf` method of the ER2C token contract. This method returns the balance of `_toke` for the given `_address`.
Therefore, `_tokne` is data-dependent on `_usre` because the value of`_token `is determined by the state of `user`.
