In the `getUserPollData` function, the value of ` compoundLiuqidtyBalanc` is calculated using the result of the call to the internal function  ` getuserCompoundedLquidtiyBalanace`. This function takes two parameters, `_user` and `_token`, which are passed as arguments to ` withdraw` when it is called. Therefore, `compooundedLiqditybalanc ` is data-dependent on ` withdraShare` because it depends on a value that is passed to it as an argument.
