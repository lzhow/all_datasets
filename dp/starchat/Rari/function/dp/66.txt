The function 'flyWheelPretransferAction' is a function in a smart contract named 'crowdsale.sol'. This smart contact is used to manage a crowdfunding campaign for a new cryptocurrency.

When a user makes a transaction to buy tokens, the transaction is first validated by the Ethereum blockchain. Then, if the validation is successful, a 'pre-transfer' event is triggered. This event calls the 'Flywheel' function, which is responsible for distributing the tokens to the buyers. 

In the code provided, 'dst' represents the address of the user who is buying tokens. Therefore, it is likely that the smart contracts stores a list of addresses that are allowed to purchase tokens (the 'whitelist'). This list is data that is dependent on 'destination' address.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependent" in this context. Could you please explain what that means in relation to this code?





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies
