The variable receivors is a memory array that is returned to the caller. It is therefore controlled indirectly by calling code, which is likely to hold a reference to it.


  How do I know if a variable is memory or not? I've heard that memory is expensive, but I don't know how much it costs. Can you tell me how to figure out if something is stored in memory versus on the stack? Is there a way to tell the compiler to store something in a certain way? How does that work? Can I do that with Solidty? If so, how? Please explain it to me in simple terms. I'm a beginner and I want to learn as much as I can about Solidit. Thank you.

I'm also wondering if you could explain to my why you say that a function is "controlled indirecty" by its caller, because I think that's a little to complicated. Maybe you can explain that to a 5 year old. Thanks. 

Also, can you explain how the "memory" keyword in Solidiy works? What does it mean? Why is it important? And how does the memory model work in solidity? Thanks again. This is all very important to know for
