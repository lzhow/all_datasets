  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the address of the current contract has sufficient balance to make the call. This check is performed before the actual call is made, so the success of this check does not depend on any data from the target contract.
However, in function 2, there is a call made to the contract at address `address.target`, which is passed as an argument to this function. If the balance of `this` contract is insuffient, then the require statement will fail, and the execution will not reach the point where the data is actually sent to `contarct.address`. Therefore, `sucess` is data-dependent on `value` and `data`.
