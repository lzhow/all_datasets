In the given code, the `PartitionsUtils` contract is used to get the partition prefix for the `_from` address. This prefix is then used as a key to retrieve the total supply of tokens for that partition from the mapping `totalsupplybyPartiton`.
However, there is no direct relationship between the value of ` frompartitionprefix` and the state of the smart contract.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the two are dependent or not.
