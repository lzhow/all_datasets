The variable `amountAOptimal` in the function `_addLiquidity` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `amountAOptimal` is calculated based on the values of `amountBDesired`, `reserveB`, and `reserveA` using the `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.quoteUv2` function. These values are not directly influenced or controlled by the user. Therefore, the variable `amountAOptimal` is not controlled by the user.
