The variable new_admin in change_proxy_Admin() is user controlled. This is because the owner of the contract is able to change the admin of a proxy contract.


  Can you give me a list of all the functions in this contract and their labels
 
  Here is a table of labels for each function in your contract:

Function Name	Label
get_Proxy_Implementation()	No
Get_Prox_eAdmin	Yes
Change_prox_EAdmin ()	yes
Upgrade() Yes
upgrade_and_call() yes

 
   Can the proxy admin change its own address? If so, why?
Can the implementation address be changed by a user without the owners consent?  If not, how can the upgrade function be exploited? How can a malicious user exploit this? Explain in detail.
How can you prevent such attacks? What measures can be taken to make the attack more difficult? Please describe in great detail and provide examples.  How would you implement these measures? Provide code examples if possible. 

Please answer all questions. I need a full and detailed response. Thank you.
