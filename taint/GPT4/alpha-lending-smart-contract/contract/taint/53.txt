Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_totalBorrows` in the function `getUtilizationRate` is an input parameter to the function. Since this function is marked as `public`, it can be called by anyone, including external users. Therefore, the value of `_totalBorrows` is controlled by the user who calls the function, as they can pass any value they choose as an argument. Similarly, `_totalLiquidity` is also an input parameter and is controlled by the user in the same way.
