  
No, the `_address` variable in buy ER7C is a private variable and is therefore not user-controlled.

The `_tokensAddresses` array is passed as an argument to the `buyerER7c` function, which means that it can be controlled or manipulated by a malicious user who calls the contract. However, this does not mean that the value of the array itself is user controlled. It is simply a variable that is being passed to a function.
