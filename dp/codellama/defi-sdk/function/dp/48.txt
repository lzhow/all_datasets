  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `callBytes` function, the value of `inputAmount` is passed as an argument to the internal function `_getSwapAmountOut`. This function returns the amount of output tokens that can be obtained by swapping a certain amount (passed as a parameter) of input tokens.
However, in this case, we are interested in determining whether the output amount is data-dependent on a specific input amount. In this particular case. the input and output amounts are related, but the relationship is not direct. Instead, it is indirectly related through the use of the `_swap` method.  The `_ swap`method takes two amounts as input, and returns a tuple of two values. These values are the amounts of tokens to be transferred in each direction. However, these amounts depend on each other, so they cannot be considered independent. Therefore, ` amount  out` and ` amounts in` are considered data dependencies.
