  
No, the `setcompborrowspeedInternal` function does not depend on ` borower` variable in ` flywhelPreborowerAction` because the former is a local variable of the latter.

The ` setcomp borrows peed internal` is called in a different function, `updatecomp borrow index`, which is also called by `distributeborwercomp` and `claimrewards`.
In these functions, there is no dependency on borowser.
