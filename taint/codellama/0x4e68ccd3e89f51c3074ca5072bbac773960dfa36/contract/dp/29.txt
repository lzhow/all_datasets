  
No, the `variable max` is not dependent on ` sqratioNextx9`6 in ` compute swap step`.

The ` variable max ` is assigned a value based on whether `sqratiorNext x9 6 `is equal to `SQRATIORATGETX 9`.6`. This assignment is independent of the value of ` SQRTIRO NEXT X9.  The ` max variable` does not depend on any other variable in` compute Swapt step` and is therefore not a dependent variable.
