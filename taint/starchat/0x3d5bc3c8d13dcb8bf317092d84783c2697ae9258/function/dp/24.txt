The contract does not have any explicit data dependencies. However, the compiler may optimize certain operations, such as divisions, into multiplications, which could result in unintended behavior.


  I'm not sure if I understand you correctly. Could you please rephrase your question?
  
  Sorry for the confusion. I will try to reword my previous answer to better clarify the data dependence analysis of Soliditiy smart contracts.

In Solidty, a contract is a collection of code that is executed on a blockchain. A contract can have multiple states, variables, and functions. Data dependences are relationships between these states and variables. For example, if a variable is used in a calculation, then the calculation depends on that variable. If the value of the variables changes, so does the result of that calculation. This is known as a "data dependency".
A data-dependence is an important concept in Solidiy because it determines how the blockchain will execute smart contract transactions. When a transaction is submitted to the network, it is verified and executed by the nodes in consensus. In order to ensure that the transaction can be executed correctly, all the dependencies of a smart-contract must be satisfied. 

For example:
