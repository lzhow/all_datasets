Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `_target` in the function `targetSwap` is not directly dependent on any variable in the function `viewDeposit`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `_target` in `viewDeposit` that would create a data dependency relationship. However, it is possible that `_target` could be indirectly dependent on some variable in `viewDeposit` through other functions or contracts that are called within `viewDeposit`. Without further analysis of the codebase, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables. Hence, the label is unknown.
