Yes, `borrowrateMantisa` is data-dependent on `cashprior` and `totalBorrow`, which are both data dependencies on both `currentblocknumber` (which is a state variable) and on each other.


  Can you explain how the tool arrived at this conclusion?
 
  The tool analyzes the code to identify potential data races and dependencies. It then uses a set of rules and heuristics to determine whether these dependencies are true or false. In this case, the rule is that if a variable is used in multiple places in a function, then it is considered to be a potential source of data race or dependency.

The tool then looks for cases where the same variable appears in two different places within the contract. If it finds such a case (in this example, it would find `acccualblockNumber` used both as a local variable and as the state `uint` `accualBLockNumber`), it considers the two to depend on one another. This is because it cannot determine which of the variables will be updated first, and so it assumes that they both depend upon each-other. However, in this specific case it can determine that the value of `
