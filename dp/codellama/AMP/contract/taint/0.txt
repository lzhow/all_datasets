  
The variable _`partition `in the _ isControlledByUser function  is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the `_isoperatorForpartition function` takes the partition as an argument, which means that the value of the `partition variable` is determined by a user input. Therefore, the`_ partition` variable is considered controlledby theuser.
