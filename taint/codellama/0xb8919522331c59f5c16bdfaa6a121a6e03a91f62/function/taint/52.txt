The variable _admin_slot is a private variable in a smart contract. It is stored in storage slot  _b_5_3_1_2_7_6_8_4_a_b229_0_93009041815525e_e1b8864875c5f95eb45cf0c44f2f4c70, which is generated by Solc. This storage location is only accessible to the contract itself and is therefore not under the control of the end user or any other external actor. Therefore, the answer is no.
