Label: yes

Reason: The variable `pendingOwner_` is set by the function `setPendingOwner`, which is an external function that can be called by anyone who has the ability to send transactions to the contract. However, the function `setPendingOwner` is guarded by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which restricts its execution to the current owner of the contract. The current owner is initially set to the address that deploys the contract (as seen in the constructor where `owner_ = msg.sender;`). Once the contract is deployed, the owner has control over the `pendingOwner_` variable by being the only one who can call `setPendingOwner` and set a new pending owner. Therefore, since the owner is a user and they have control over the `pendingOwner_` variable, it is considered to be controlled by the user.
