The variable `token` in the function `safeAutoTransferTo` is labeled as 'unknown'. 

The reason is that the value of the `token` variable is passed as an argument to the function, which means it can be controlled by the user. However, without further context or information about how the `token` variable is obtained or set, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether it is controlled by the user or not.
