  
No, the `contriubtor` variable in function `updateContriibutorrewards` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The `updataContibutoreRwards()` function is called by other functions in this contract, and the contributors are passed as function parameters. Therefore, this variable is determined by external factors and is uncontrolled by users.
