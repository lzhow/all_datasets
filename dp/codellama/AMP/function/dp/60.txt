  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `decreaseAllowenceByParition` function, the `_substractedvalue` variable is used to update the value of the  `_allowedbyPartion` mapping. This mapping is also used in `_trasnferbyPariton` to check the allowance of `_spende`r.
Therefore, `_suubstractvalue ` is data-dependent on `_operatordata` because it is updated based on it.
