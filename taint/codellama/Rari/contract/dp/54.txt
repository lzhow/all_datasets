  
The label is 'No'.

In the `sub` function, the parameter `a` is not used, and the only variable that is used is `c`, which is calculated using the addition of `uint` variables ` a` and ` b`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between ` c`and ` error Message` because `  error message`is not a variable in ` sub`.
