  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiity





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers is any tool that takes a set of files that make up a web application and combines them into a single file that can be served to a client's browser. This combined file is often referred to as a "bundle" or "asset".
There are several types of incremental bundle tools, but the most common are:
- bunders: these tools take a graph of dependencies between modules and generate a bundle that includes all the necessary code, inlining any dependencies that are already available in that bundle. They are designed to optimize the size of a resulting bundle by removing any code that is already included. Examples of bundlers include Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, Browserify, etc.
