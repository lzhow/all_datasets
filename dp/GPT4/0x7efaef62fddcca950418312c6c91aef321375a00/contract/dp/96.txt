Reason: The variable `to` in the function `_safeTransfer` represents the destination address to which tokens are being transferred. It is a parameter of the function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. On the other hand, the variable `balance1Adjusted` in the function `swap` is a local variable used to store an adjusted balance after a swap operation has taken place, which is part of the swap logic to ensure the constant product formula (x * y = k) is maintained.

There is no direct assignment or computation in the smart contract code that would indicate a data dependency between `to` and `balance1Adjusted`. The value of `to` does not influence the calculation of `balance1Adjusted`, nor does `balance1Adjusted` affect the value of `to`. They are used in different contexts within their respective functions and do not interact with each other. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
