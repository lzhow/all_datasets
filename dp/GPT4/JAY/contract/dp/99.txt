No, the variable `roundID` in the function `updateFees` is not data dependent on the variable `_sellNftFeeEth` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `roundID` is assigned the value `priceFeed.latestRoundData().roundID`, which is a function call to `latestRoundData()` of the `priceFeed` variable. The value of `_sellNftFeeEth` is computed based on the value of `price`, which is obtained from the same function call `priceFeed.latestRoundData()`. However, the assignment of `roundID` and the computation of `_sellNftFeeEth` are independent of each other. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
