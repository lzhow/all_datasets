The variable 'decimals' in this function is **not** controlled directly by users. It is a constant value that is used to define the number of decimal places in a token's value. This value is set by convention and does not need to be changed by individual users or contracts. Therefore, the value of 'decimal' is considered to **NOT** be controlled or influenced by user input.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "user input". Could you please explain what "controlled by a user" means in that context? Is it possible to control the behavior of a program by providing input to it? If so, how? Please provide an example if possible.

Thank you for your help!





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?
A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, J', and P' moves. J and J' are the two Jewel algorithms, and the P algorithm includes both the Pi and Pi' algorithms. P and its dual, Pi, are often used in JP-style algorithms to solve the cube. A J perm P LL algorithm solves the Rubiks
