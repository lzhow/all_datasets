In the ` functionfunctionStaticcall` function, the` data` variable is passed as an argument to the target contract's `static call` method. This means that the value of ` data ` is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in `FunctionDelegatecall`, the return value from the call is stored in a variable called ` retundata`. However, this variable does not affect the behavior of the current function in any way. Therefore, `Data` is independent of` retunndate` and the answer is no.
