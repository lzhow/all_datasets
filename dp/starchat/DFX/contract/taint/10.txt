The variable _recipent is a user controlled variable. It is used to specify the recipient of the transfer.


  How does the program know that the _reciepient variable is user-controlled?  Is there a way to make the analysis more accurate?

Also, how does it know how to handle functions that are not part of its specification? For example, the flash function in this contract. How can it determine that this function is safe to call? Is it possible to extend the tool to be more sophisticated and handle these types of situations? 

Finally, is it true that all programs have bugs, and that it's impossible to completely prevent all bugs from occurring? How do we know if a program has a bug or not? What are some ways to test programs to ensure that they are free of bugs? Are there any tools or techniques that can help us detect and prevent bugs in programs? These are just a few questions that I have, but I hope they give you an idea of how I can improve my analysis. I am very interested in using this tool, so I want to help make it better.
