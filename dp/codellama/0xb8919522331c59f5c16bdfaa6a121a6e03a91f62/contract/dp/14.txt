Explanation:
In the ` function delegateCall` function, the` success` variable is set to the result of the call expression ` target . delegatecall (data) `. The call is made to a contract at the address stored in ` address `, and the data is passed as an argument to ` delegatecal`l.
Since the value of ` success ` depends on ` data ` and `address`, it is data-dependent.
