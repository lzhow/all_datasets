Explanation: The variable `amounts` in the function `buyERC1155` is not directly referenced or used in the function `buyJay`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `amounts` and `success`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency between them if the value of `amounts` affects the execution or outcome of `buyJay` in some way that is not apparent from the provided code snippet. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
