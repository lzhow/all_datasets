Reason: The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is used to store the result of a low-level `token.call()` operation, which is an external call to transfer tokens. It is a boolean that indicates whether the token transfer was successful or not. On the other hand, the variable `_reserve1` in the function `burn` represents the reserve of token1 in the liquidity pool at the time of the burn operation. There is no direct relationship or computation in the smart contract code that would cause `success` to be dependent on the value of `_reserve1`. The success of the token transfer does not rely on the liquidity reserves but rather on the execution of the transfer itself. Therefore, `success` and `_reserve1` are not data dependent.
