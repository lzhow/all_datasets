The variable _dDelta is not used in either function, so it cannot be data-dependent on either variable.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand your answer. Could you please explain what you mean by "data-dependence relationship"?
  
  Data-dependency is a term used to describe how one variable or value in a program depends on another variable, or set of variables. In the context of your question, the term "depend" means that the value of one or more variables is determined by the values of other variables, and therefore changes to the other variable(s) can affect the calculation of the dependent variable's value.

In your code example, it is possible to determine that _Delta does not affect either _GLiquidity or _Balances, which means it does no data depend on them. Therefore, in your example the answer is no, as _Ddelta is independent of _NGLIQ and _NBals
