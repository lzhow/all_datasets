  
No, the ` factory` variable in function `pairfor` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` pairfor()` function takes in two parameters, `tokena` and `tokent`, and returns the address of the corresponding pair contract. This function is used to get the pair address for a given token pair.  The ` tokena ` and` tokent` parameters are not user-controlled, they are passed as arguments to the  function. Therefore, this variable is also not under the control of a user, and it cannot be used for malicious purposes.
