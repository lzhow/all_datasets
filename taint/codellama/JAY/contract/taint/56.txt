  
No, the ` roundId` variable in function `getLatetPrice` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it doesn't have any user input.

The ` getLatesPrice()` function is a public function that returns the latest price of the asset. It uses the Chainlink Aggregrator V3 Interface to get the price data.  The `latestroundData()` method of `priceFeed` returns a tuple of values, including the current round ID, price in US dollars, and other information. However, since the round id is generated by ChaiLink, not the users, so it cannot be controlled.
