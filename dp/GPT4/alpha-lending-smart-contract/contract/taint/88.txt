Reason: The variable `WAD` in the function `wad()` is a constant with a value of `1e18` (which represents 1 followed by 18 zeros, or 10^18). Since it is defined as a constant within the library `WadMath`, its value is fixed and cannot be altered by the user or any other external input. It is hard-coded into the contract and does not depend on any user-provided data. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
