  
The variable 'value' in function 'functionCallwithValue' is 'controlled by user'.

This is because the value of the 'amount' parameter is passed as an argument to the call function. This means that the caller of this function can control the amount of Ether that is sent to 'recipient'. Therefore, the state of 'Amount' variable is under the control of user and is labeled as 'Yes'.
