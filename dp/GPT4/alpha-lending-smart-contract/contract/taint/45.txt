Label: No

Reason: The variable `tokensPerBlock` is an array that is part of the state of the `AlphaReleaseRule` contract. It is modified by the `setTokenPerBlock` function, which is restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that only the owner of the contract (as determined by the `Ownable` contract's state) can call `setTokenPerBlock` and change the `tokensPerBlock` array. Since the owner is typically a specific account that deployed the contract or has been transferred ownership, and not any arbitrary user, the variable `tokensPerBlock` is not controlled by the user in a general sense. It is controlled by the owner, which is a specific privileged user.
