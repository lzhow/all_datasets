The variable `erc721TokenAddress` in the function `buyJay` is passed as an argument to the function `buyJayWithERC721` where it is named `_tokenAddress`. This indicates a direct data dependency as the value of `erc721TokenAddress` is used within `buyJayWithERC721` through its parameter `_tokenAddress`. The data from `erc721TokenAddress` is necessary for the execution of `buyJayWithERC721`, and any changes to `erc721TokenAddress` would affect the behavior of `buyJayWithERC721`.
