The contract has a function called `withdraw` that allows users to withdraw their proportional share of the curve token. This function is marked as non-reentrant, meaning that it cannot be called recursively.

In the `if` statement, the value of `curve` is updated to reflect the withdrawal of `_curvedToburn` curves. However, this update is not atomic, and another user could call `transfer` or `approve` between the time the user's balance is retrieved and the update to `totalsupply`.
This could result in a race condition where the balance of a user is reduced, but the total supply is increased, leading to a negative totalsupply.


  How can I fix this?
 
  You can add a mutex lock to prevent the race conditions. Here's an example of how you can do this:
 ```solidity
pragma solidity 5.0
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.4/contracts-ethereum-package/drafts/Counters. sol";
contract MyContract {
    using Counters for Counter;
    Counter private _mutex;

    function myFunction() internal {
