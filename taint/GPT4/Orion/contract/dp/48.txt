Yes, the variable `tokenAOrWETH` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is data dependent on the variable `tokenA` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of `tokenAOrWETH` is assigned the value of `tokenA` in the following line of code: `tokenAOrWETH = tokenA;`. Therefore, the value of `tokenA` directly affects the value of `tokenAOrWETH`, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
