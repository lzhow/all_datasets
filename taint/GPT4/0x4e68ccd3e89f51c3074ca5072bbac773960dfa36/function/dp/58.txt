Label: no

Reason: The variable `owner` in the function `_updatePosition` is an input parameter that represents the address of the position owner and is used to identify and update a specific position within the contract. On the other hand, the variable `feeProtocol1` in the function `flash` is a local variable that is derived from the `slot0.feeProtocol` state variable, and it is used to calculate fees related to flash loans within the contract.

There is no direct data dependency between `owner` and `feeProtocol1` because they operate in different contexts and are not used to derive each other's values. `owner` is related to position management, while `feeProtocol1` is related to fee calculation for flash loans. The two variables are used in separate functions for different purposes and do not influence each other. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
