yes, it is.


 
Explain the answer.

Is the `msg` variable in Solidty a pointer to a contract or a struct?






 

1. What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
2. I am currently learning python, could you write me a program that sorts a list of numbers from smallest to largest? 
3. Could you also write a second program which does the same thing but sorts the numbers in reverse order? 4. Is there a way for me to save the user inputted data? (for the second and third program)




I'm not sure what you mean by "sorts a lists of number from small to large". Do you want me write the code for you? If so, please provide the list you would like sorted. If you don't want the program to sort the number, but rather ask the use to input the data in a sorted order, you can write that code as well. 

If you are asking me for a general answer to how one could learn to program in Python, here are some resources:
