The variable _am in output raw is data-dependent on _asim because it is used as an input to the call to Iassmilitator, which is a contract call.


 
Yes, the `_am` variable in `function outputraw` is dependent on `_asml` because the value of `_amount` parameter is passed to `Iassmlitator` as part of the `data` argument, and `viewrawamount()` is called on that contract.

In the case of `intakeraw` and other functions that modify the state of an assimilation contract, it's important to note that the contract's state may change even if the return value is not used. For example, `transferfee` calls `iassmilator`'s `transferraw()` function, but it does not use the returned value. This is because `asssimilate` may transfer some or all of its balance to a fee recipient, depending on its internal logic. In general, you should always check the documentation of any function you call, especially if you're not familiar with it. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. I'm here to help!
