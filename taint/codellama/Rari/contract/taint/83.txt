  
No, the ` i` variable in function `_setcompSpees` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be modified by any external user or attacker.

The ` _ setcompSpeds` function is only called by admin and the admin is trusted to set the comp speeds for all the ctokens. Therefore, there is no risk of a user controlling the value of `I` in this function.
