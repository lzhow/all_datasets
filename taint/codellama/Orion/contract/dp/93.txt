In the `_do_swap` function, the `path` variable is passed to the  `_ swap` and `_swapCurves` functions.
`_ swapCurv`e uses the`path `variable to get the pool address for the current pair of tokens.  The `pool` address is then used to call the exchange function on that pool.   The`output ` variable in `_ swa`pCur`ve is used as an argument to this function. Therefore, ` amount  `1`Out ` in` _ swap ` is data-dependent on ` output `in` `_ `swap `Cur `ve.
