  
No, the variables `factoriess` and ` initialtransfersource` are independent.

The variable  ` factoriest` is a state variable of the contract, and it is not modified in any of its functions. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on any other variable.  On the other hand, `initaltransfersource`  is an internal variable that is only used in function  `_doswaptokens`. It is created and modified within the scope of this function, so it does not affect the state of any variable outside of it. As a result, there is no data dependence between `factorest ` and  initial transfers source.
