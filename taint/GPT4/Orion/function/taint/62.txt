The variable `token` in the function `safeTransfer` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The `token` variable is passed as a parameter to the function `safeTransfer`, which means its value is determined by the caller of the function. The user does not have direct control over the value of `token`, as it is provided as an argument to the function. Therefore, the variable `token` is not controlled by the user.
