  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `totalBorrow` variable is used to calculate the value of ` cahsPlusborrowsminusReserve`. The ` totalReserver` and `add_( totalAdminFee,totalFusFeese)` variables are also used in this calculation.
Therefore, `Cahsplusborrowminusreserve` is data-dependent on `totalsupply`.
Similarly, in function two, `_totalexchange` uses `getCashrPriore` to get the total cashed value. This value is then used with `TotalBorrrow`and `Add_(TotalReserv,add_ (TotalAdminfee,TotalFuFe)))` to obtain ` Cashplusborrrow minusreserves`. Therefore,`CachplusBorgrowMinusrreser`is also datadependenton`totalaSuppl`.
