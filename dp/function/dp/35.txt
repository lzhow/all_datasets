  
The variable 'mathError' in function 'accureInterst' is not dependent on variable error in 'liqudateBorrrowInternal'.

Reason:
In function liquidationBowrrow, the error variable is assigned the value of accureinterst function. However, this does not mean that the mathError variable in accuredInterset function is dependent of the Error variable.
