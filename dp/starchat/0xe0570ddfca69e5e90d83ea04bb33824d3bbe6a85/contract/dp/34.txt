   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?




I'm not sure what you mean by "good". There are many different ways to start learning how
to code. For example, you could start with a beginner's course like Codecademy's Python
course, or you might want to look into more advanced courses like the free CodeAcademy
Python course.

Another option is to find a mentor or a bootcamp. A mentee or mentors can help you
find the right boot camp that fits your learning style and learning goals.





Can you give me a list of free online resources for learning Python? I want a short list, not a long course or anything like that. I just want some good places to go to get started. Thanks!
