Label: no

Reason: The variable `value` in the function `decodeI32` is not data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `decodeBytes65`. In Solidity, function scope means that variables declared within a function are local to that function and are not accessible or related to variables in other functions unless passed as arguments or accessed through state variables or storage. In this case, `value` in `decodeI32` is calculated within its own function scope using its own local `data` parameter, which is separate from the `data` parameter in `decodeBytes65`. There is no shared state or direct relationship between these two variables as they are defined and used in separate functions.
