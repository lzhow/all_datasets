No, they do not have exactly the semantic equivalence. There are two main reasons that make the codes different semanticaly:

1. Different variable names: In the first code, the input variable name is "N", but in the mutated code it is named "x". These names are used to represent the inputs and can have different meanings, depending on their context. In some cases, a name like "num" might be used instead.
2. Behavior changes: The mutator replaces "--" with "+". The original intent behind this modification is to change the direction of the while loop and cause it to exit earlier, resulting in a different output. However, as the original author did not intend for the program behavior to be modified this way, it does not result in semantic equality.
