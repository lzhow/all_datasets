In the case of the code provided, the value of supportingfee is determined by a user input. This means that it can be controlled directly by an external user and therefore, is considered controlled.


  Can you explain how the contract works? I'm not very good at coding. I've never seen solidity before. Can I just use it to buy and sell stuff? Or do I need to know more about it? Can it do more than just buying andselling? What are some good things to do with it once I know how it works. What can I do to make money? How can it be used for art? For example, can you make a piece of art that shows the price of something like ether or bitcoin in real time? Is that possible? If so, how would I go about doing that?
