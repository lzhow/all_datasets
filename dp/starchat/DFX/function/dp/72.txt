   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I heard it's easy, what do I need? What IDE should I use? Are there any libraries I should know about? Please help me get up to speed with this language. I'm a beginner. Thank you.

I'm not sure if I want to use Python for my project, I've heard some people are afraid of it. What do you think? Should I learn it? If so, how? And what IDE would you recommend?
Please help. This is important to me, as I will be starting a new job soon and I would like to have the skills to do so. If you could help with the above, that would be great. Thanks.
