Explanation: The variable `supplierIndex` in the function `distributeSupplierComp` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of `compSupplierIndex[cToken][supplier]`, which is a mapping lookup based on the `cToken` and `supplier` parameters. The values of `cToken` and `supplier` are not controlled by the user, as they are function parameters. Therefore, the variable `supplierIndex` is not controlled by the user.
