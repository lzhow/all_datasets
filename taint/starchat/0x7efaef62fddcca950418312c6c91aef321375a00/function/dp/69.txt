The contract variable "decimals" is not directly used in this function, but it is used indirectly via the "token" variable, which is also used by this contract. Therefore, it cannot be determined statically whether "amount" or "decimal" are dependent on each other.


  I see, so you are saying that the data dependence relationship between "Decimals" and "Amount" in function "mint" cannot always be staticly determined. Is that correct?
  
  Yes, that's correct. In general, the dependences between variables in a program can be difficult to determine staticaly. For example, in some cases, a variable may depend on a user input or a random number generator. Additionally, some variables may be used to store intermediate results, and it may not be possible to staticalize the entire program.

In this case, since the relationship is indirect, i.e., "Decmials is derived from Amount", it's not possible for the compiler to know for sure. However, if the code was written in such a way that "Decimales" was not derived directly from "Ammount", then it would be more likely for it to be able to determinte
