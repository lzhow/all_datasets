The variable `_allowed` is a mapping from addresses to uints. It is used to track the allowances that have been granted to other addresses.

In the `approve` function, the `_spenders` address is set to `_amount`. This means that the value of `_allowances[_spenders][sender]` is now set equal to the amount that was approved. This value can be changed by calling the approve function again with a different `_value`.
Therefore, `_isControllable` for `_approvee` would be `yes` if `_operator` equals `_sender` or if `sender`_operator is in `_authorizedOperators`. `_authorizee`_isControlled would also be yes if any of the keys in `allowed`_spending are controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was five. Thank you!
