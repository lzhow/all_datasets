   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how. I have heard that python is easy, but I don't know where to start. What should I do? I've heard people talk about using repl.it, codecademy, and visual studio code. Which of these are the best? And what should be my first steps? Please help me. Thank you.

I am a high school student who is interested in computer science. My age is 9 years old.  I was born in Germany. In my free time I like to play video games, read mangas, draw and paint. As a kid I always liked to tinker with things. Especially when I saw my older brother play with Lego. That sparked my interest in building and repairing things myself. When I turned 6 years my brothers were already building a PC for me and my sister. Soon after that I learned about HTML and CSS and started building my own
