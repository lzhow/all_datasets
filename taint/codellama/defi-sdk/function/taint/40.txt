  
No, the ` fixedSidAmount ` variable in function `callBytes` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` callbytes ` function is called by a user, but the value of the parameter ` fixedsidamount ` is passed by another contract, which is a different contract than the one that calls the  ` calbytes` function. Therefore, `fixedsideamount` cannot be controlled directly by any user input.
