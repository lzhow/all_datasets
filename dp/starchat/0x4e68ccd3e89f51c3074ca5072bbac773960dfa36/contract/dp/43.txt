   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am currently in high school, and I took AP Computer Science A in 7th grade. Is that enough to get started with python, or do I need to take an additional class? I know some other languages like Java and C++, but Python has been around for longer and seems more beginner-friendly. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
   

  What are some good websites to practice python on?  I want to be able to do some simple projects to help me get better at it.  Please provide a list of 5 or so websites.   I would like each website to have an easy-to-follow tutorial as well as a set of projects that can be done to test your skills.    I realize this may take some time to research, so please only take about 30 minutes on each site.     Thank you!  -Jeff
