The contract state `compAccrued` is data dependent on the variable `deltaBlocks` in the function `updateContributorRewards`. The reason for this is that `deltaBlocks` is used to calculate `newAccrued`, which is then added to `compAccrued[contributor]`. The calculation of `newAccrued` is directly influenced by the value of `deltaBlocks`, which represents the number of blocks that have passed since the last update for the contributor. This means that changes to `deltaBlocks` will affect the value of `compAccrued` for the contributor, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
