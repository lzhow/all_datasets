  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `function` getD, the local variable D is assigned a value based on a calculation involving the parameter A. Specifically, D= (A*S+D_p*NCOins)*D/((A-1)* D+ ( NCOin+1 )*Dp). Therefore, if the value of A changes, then the calculation of D will also change, and therefore D depends on A in this function.
