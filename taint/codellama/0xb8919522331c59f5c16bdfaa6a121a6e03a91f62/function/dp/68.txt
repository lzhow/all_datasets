In the ` functionfunctionCallwithValue` function, the` data` variable is passed as an argument to the target contract's `call` method. This means that the value of ` data ` is determined by the caller of the contract and is not dependent on any other variable or state in this contract.
On the other hand, in `FunctionStaticcall`, the data variable` is used as a parameter to call the staticcall method of another contract, which is also passed in as the first argument. However, this does not mean that `Data` in` FunctionStatic call` depends on ` Data`in`FunctionCall with Value`.
Both functions are independent of each other and do not share any state or variables. Therefore, we can conclude that` Data `in ` FunctionCall With Value` and`Data ` in  `  Function Static Call` are unrelated and not dependant on eachother.
