Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `value` in the function `safeTransfer` is data dependent on the variable `spender` in the function `safeIncreaseAllowance`. This is because the value of `value` is used as an argument in the `abi.encodeWithSelector` function call, which is called within the `_callOptionalReturn` function. The `_callOptionalReturn` function is called in both `safeTransfer` and `safeIncreaseAllowance` functions. Since the value of `spender` is used to calculate `newAllowance` in the `safeIncreaseAllowance` function, and `newAllowance` is then used as an argument in the `abi.encodeWithSelector` function call, there is a data dependency between `value` and `spender`.
