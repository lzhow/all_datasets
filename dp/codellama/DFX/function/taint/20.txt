  
No, the ` o GLi q_ ` variable in function ` get Origin Sw apData ` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it doesn't have any user input.

The `getOrigin Sw a pData` function is a private function that is called by other functions in this contract. It takes in several parameters, including the curve storage, input index, output index and amount. This function calculates the amount of liquidity that will be used in a swap operation and returns it as a variable called `amt`. The ` am t _` variable is calculated based on the liquidities of the input and output assets, and the balance of each asset. However, this variable does not have a user-controlled input, so it cannot be controlled directly by a malicious user or a smart contract attacker.
