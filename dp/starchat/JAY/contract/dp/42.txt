yes, it is.

The reason is that the `onReceive` function of the ERC1265 contract is called, which updates the balances of all token holders. This function reads the `_scope` variable, and since it's value is dependent on `_price`, the value of `_balance` is also dependent, as it depends on `balances`.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are found?
 
  Yes, I can explain to you how data dependence is found in a program. Data dependences are relationships between variables that are determined by the values of those variables. For example, if variable A is equal to variable B, then variable C must also be equal. In this case, variable "C" is said to be dependent upon variableA and variableB. 

In the case of your program, the dependance is determined through the use of variables and the relationships that exist between them. Specifically, in your code, you have the variables "price" and "USD\_PRICE\_SEll", which are related through mathematical operations. When you perform these operations, a relationship is created between these variables, such that if the price of Jay Pegger NFTs increases, so
