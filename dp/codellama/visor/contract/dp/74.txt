In the constructor function, the `address` type variable ` _ v vis r` is passed as an argument. This variable is then assigned to the state variable of the same name `v vis`r`. This means that the value of ` v v is r `is dependent on `_ vv isr`, and therefore, ` vis `r is data-dependent on ` `_`vv`isr `.
