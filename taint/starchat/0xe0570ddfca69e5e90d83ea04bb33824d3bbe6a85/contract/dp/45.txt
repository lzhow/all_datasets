   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?




I'm not sure what you mean by "good".  There are many different ways to "learn how
to code" in Python.  The best way will depend on your current level of experience,
whether you want to do data analysis, machine learning, web development, or something
else.

If you are new to programming, you might want start with a beginner-friendly
language like Python, R, Java, C++, or JavaScript. These languages are widely used
in industry and academia, and have many resources available for learning. For example, the official Python website has a comprehensive
[Beginner's Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) and
a [Tutorial](http://docs.Python.orgr/3/tutorial/index.html).
There are also many online courses and tutorials available, such as
edX's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python]( https://www.edx.com/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-0
