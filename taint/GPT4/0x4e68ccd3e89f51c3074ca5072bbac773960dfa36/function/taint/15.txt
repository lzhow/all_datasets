Label: yes

Reason: The variable `upper` in the `update` function is a parameter that is passed in when the function is called. Since Solidity functions can be called by external users (assuming the function is exposed to them and not private), the value of `upper` is determined by the user who initiates the transaction that calls the `update` function. Therefore, it is controlled by the user.
