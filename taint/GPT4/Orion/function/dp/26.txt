Explanation: The variable `amountADesired` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is data dependent on the variable `tokenA` in the same function because the value of `amountADesired` is modified based on the value of `tokenA` in the following line of code:

```
amountADesired = LibUnitConverter.decimalToBaseUnit(tokenA, amountADesired);
```

The `decimalToBaseUnit` function is called with the arguments `tokenA` and `amountADesired`, indicating that the value of `amountADesired` is dependent on the value of `tokenA`.
