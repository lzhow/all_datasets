Reason: The variable `_reserve0` is obtained from the function `getReserves()` and is used to calculate `amount0` and potentially influence the `feeOn` state through the `_mintFee` function. The variable `_totalSupply` is a separate state variable that represents the total supply of the liquidity tokens. It is used to calculate the `liquidity` that will be minted in the current transaction. There is no direct assignment or computation in the provided code that indicates `_reserve0` is calculated based on `_totalSupply` or vice versa. They are used independently in different parts of the `mint` function to determine different outcomes (amounts to mint and fee calculation). Therefore, `_reserve0` does not have a data dependency on `_totalSupply` within the scope of the `mint` function as shown in the provided code snippet.
