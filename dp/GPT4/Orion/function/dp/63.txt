No, the variable `N_COINS` in the function `get_D` is not data dependent on the variable `_x` in the function `get_y`. 

The reason is that the variable `N_COINS` in the function `get_D` is a local variable that is only used within the function `get_D`. It is not passed as an argument or modified by any other function. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `N_COINS` and `_x`.
