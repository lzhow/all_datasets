The variable "dst" in `transferVerify` is a controlled variable, as it represents the intended recipient of the transfer. This variable is provided by a user of a smart contract, and therefore it can be considered to be controlled.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract and label them as either controlled or not?  Also, can you explain how the analysis works? I'm not sure I understand what "controlled" means in this context.  Thanks.

Also, please provide a link to the documentation for this analysis if it exists. I couldn't find any. 

Thanks.


I'm looking for a tool that can help me identify if a variable in a Solidty smartcontract is user controlled, or if that variable can have a value set by an attacker. Can this be done? If so, how? Please explain. If not, why not. Thanks!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples of tools that use this technology? Can it be used for React, Vue, Angular, etc.? Explain it to me at a level a data scientist can understand
