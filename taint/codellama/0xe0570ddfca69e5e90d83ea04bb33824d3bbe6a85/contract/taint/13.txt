  
No, the `_entered` variable in this function `nonReenterant` is a private variable that is used to prevent reentrance attacks. It is set to  `1` when the contract is entered and `2` if it has been entered before. This variable is internal to this contract and is therefore not directly controlled or manipulated by a user, but rather by internal logic within the smart contract. Therefore, this variable should be labeled as 'No' as it does not represent a variable controlled directly by user input.
