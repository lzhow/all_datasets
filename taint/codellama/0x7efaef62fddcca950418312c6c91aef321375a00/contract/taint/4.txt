It' s not possible for the balance to be controlled directly by a user, as it would require a malicious actor to have access to the smart contract' 's private key.

The ` swap` function is designed to ensure that the liquidty of a pool is maintained, and that there is always a sufficient supply of liquid tokens available for trading. By adjusting the balances of each token based  on their current reserves,  the swap function ensures that a fair price is achieved for each trade.
