In the constructor function, the `_mInt` function is called, which is a function of the ER727 contract. This function takes four arguments: `to`, `value`, `_data`, and `operatorData`. The `msg` variable is passed as the `from` argument, and the value of `initialSuppy` is used as `amount`.
  The `_ symbol` and `_name` variables are set to "noodle" and " nood" respectively.
   The default operators are passed to the third argument `_operator`.
