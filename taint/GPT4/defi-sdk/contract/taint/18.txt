Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `pendingOwner_` is not explicitly defined or used in the provided Solidity contract code snippet. Since the code does not contain any reference to `pendingOwner_`, it is not possible to determine whether it is controlled by the user or not. The label is therefore 'unknown'. If `pendingOwner_` were part of an inherited contract or a pattern such as the "Ownable" contract, it would typically be associated with ownership transfer logic, but without the actual code or context, we cannot make a definitive classification.
