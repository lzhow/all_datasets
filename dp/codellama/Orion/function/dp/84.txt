  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `function` ` getD`, the local variable` D` is calculated based on `xp` and `amp`. The `for` loop iterates over `N` times, and the value of `S` changes each iteration.
However, the loop does not depend on any variable from the outside, so it is not a function of the variables from outside.  The variable D is a local function variable, which is only used within the scope of this function. Therefore, it does depend only on local variables and is independent of any external variables.
