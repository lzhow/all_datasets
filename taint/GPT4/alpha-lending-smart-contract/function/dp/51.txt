Reason: The variable `pool` in both `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount` and `withdrawReserve` functions refers to the same state variable from the mapping `pools` indexed by the address of the `_token` parameter. In Solidity, the `storage` keyword indicates that the variable is a pointer to state storage, which persists between function calls and transactions. Therefore, any changes to `pool` in `withdrawReserve` (such as the line `pool.poolReserves = pool.poolReserves.sub(_amount);`) will affect the state of `pool` in `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount` on subsequent calls, since they both point to the same location in the contract's state. This establishes a data dependency relationship between the `pool` variable in both functions.
