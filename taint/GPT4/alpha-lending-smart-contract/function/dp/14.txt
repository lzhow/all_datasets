Reason: The variable `shareAmount` in the `deposit` function is calculated within the scope of that function and is dependent on the parameters `_token` and `_amount` passed to the `deposit` function. It is used to mint tokens and emit an event within the same function. On the other hand, the variable `_token` in the `liquidate` function is a parameter of that function and is used in the context of liquidation. There is no direct data flow or dependency from the `_token` in `liquidate` to the `shareAmount` in `deposit` as they are used in separate functions and their scopes do not overlap. Additionally, there is no indication in the provided code snippet that the result of `shareAmount` calculation is stored in a state variable or passed to the `liquidate` function, which would be required for a data dependency to exist.
