The variable `alphaMultipler` is a state variable that is updated in `receiveAlpha` function. It is used to calculate the reward amount for the users. Since it's a internal state, the value of `alphamultiplier` can be determined by dividing the total supply of the token.

So, yes, `alphanumeric` variable is controled by user


  How can I determine the current value for alphaMultiplerr?  I don't see any function that updates it.
 
  The value can't be directly determined, as it depends on the supply and the amount of rewards that have been distributed. However, you can calculate it by using the formula:
`alpha_multiplier = (current_reward_amount * 10^18) / total_supply`
Where `current reward_amout` represents the sum of all rewards received by all users, and `total_suply` the number of tokens in existence. This formula can also be used for determining the rewards earned by a specific user, by substituting their balance for `balanceOf()`.
