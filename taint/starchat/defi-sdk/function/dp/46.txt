   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I heard it's easy, right? But I've never coded before and I'm not sure where or how I'd start...
  
  I am a beginner and would like to know how can I start learning Python. I do not have any experience with programming. Can you give me some tips and resources to help me get familiar with the language? Please, provide a step-by-step guide. Thank you.

I am looking for a language that is simple to read and write, yet powerful and versatile. Python seems like a great fit for me. What do you think? Is Python a right language for beginners? What other languages are worth trying? Thank You.
