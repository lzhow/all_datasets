Explanation: The variable `b` in the function `tryMul` is data dependent on the variable `b` in the function `sub`. This is because the variable `b` is used as an input parameter in both functions, and any changes to the value of `b` in the `sub` function will affect the value of `b` in the `tryMul` function.
