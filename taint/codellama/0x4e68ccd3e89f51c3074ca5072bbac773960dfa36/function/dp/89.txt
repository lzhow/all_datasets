There is no direct data dependence between the two. However, there is an indirect data flow between them.
In the first function, the `info.secondPerLiqidtyOutSideX218 ` variable is assigned the value of ` secondsperLqditycumulativX8192` minus the current value. This means that the new value is dependent on `secondperLiqtity cumulative X8291`.
Similarly, in function two, ` info .secondsperliqutityoutsidex2208 is also assigned a value that is calculated by subtracting the previous value from the input value ` secondperliquity cimulative x2304`. This also means there's a dependency between `secodsperlquidity outsid x8311` and ` secods per liquidty cumulatve x 8413`.
