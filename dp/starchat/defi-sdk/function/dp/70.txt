yes, it is.

The reason is that the `callBytes` function takes a `bytes callData`, which is a dynamic array of bytes. This array is then decoded into a tuple of several other variables, including `address weeth`.
Since `msg.value` is not a state variable, and `this` refers to the current contract, `withdrawEth` cannot be called directly from `swapEthToToken`, as it would not be able to access the ether that was sent with the transaction.


  How can I fix this?
 
  You can fix the issue by removing the call to `SafeERC`2`.safetransfer` and instead use the built-in `transferFrom` method of the ERC2`0` token contract. Here's the updated code:
 ```  solidity
SafeTransfer.sol
pragma solidity ^0
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC/I ERC 2  token. sol";
library SafeTransfer {
    function safeTransferFrom(
        I ERC _2 token,
        address from, 
        address to,  
        uint amount
    ) public {
        bool success = token. transferFrom ( from, to, amount );
        require ( success
