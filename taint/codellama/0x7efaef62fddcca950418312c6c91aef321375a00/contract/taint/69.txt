  
No, the `_ reserve ​​0 ` variable in function `_update` is NOT controlled  by user .

The `_ update` function is called by `m int` and `burn` functions, which are internal functions and are not exposed to the outside world. Therefore, `_ reserver  ` is a local variable that is created and modified within the scope of the ` _ update ` function, and it cannot be controlled directly by users.
