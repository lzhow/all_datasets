  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `receiveAlpha` function, the `_amout` variable is passed as an argument to the external function `transerFrom` of the contract `AlphaTokens`. This means that the value of `_ammount` is set by an external user, and it cannot be controlled directly by this contract. Therefore, we can conclude that `_ amount` in this function is under the control of a user and the answer is yes.
