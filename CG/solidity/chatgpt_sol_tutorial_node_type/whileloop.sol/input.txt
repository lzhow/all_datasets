You are a Solidtiy Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a Solidtiy code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has two attributes, type and value.
    
    The input file is 
    ```
    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract S {
   function A(uint j) internal pure returns (uint) {
      while (j != 0) {
         j += 10;
      }
        return j;
   }
}
    ```
