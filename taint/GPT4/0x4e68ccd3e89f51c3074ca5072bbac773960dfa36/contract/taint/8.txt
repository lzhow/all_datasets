Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `x` in the function `sub` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter of the function and its value is passed by the caller of the function. However, without further context or information about how the function is used and where the value of `x` comes from, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label is unknown.
