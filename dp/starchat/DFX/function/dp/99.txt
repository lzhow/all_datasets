The function sub has two parameters: a and b. It also has a string variable errorMessage.

In the try Div function, there are two uint variables: `a` and ` b`.
However, the `tryDiv` function does not have the string `errorMessage` as a parameter. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the variables ` a` or `  b` are dependent on ` errorMessage`.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the two functions are:
try_div and sub.
 
  The try_Div function has the parameters a (of type uint) and  ` ` (which is a placeholder for the second parameter). The function is internal and pure, and it returns a tuple of two values: (1) a bool indicating whether the operation was successful, (2) an uint value containing the result of the division. 

On the other hand, sub function takes three parameters. Two of them are uints, while the third is of type string. This function also returns an `uint` value, but it does so by using the unchecked block. Inside the block, we first check if b is equal to  zero. If it
