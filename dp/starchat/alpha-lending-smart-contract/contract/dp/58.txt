   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start.
   

  What are some good websites to practice coding in Python? I want to become good at it but don’t know how. I’ve heard it takes a lot of practice to get good, so I need a way of getting practice without having to go to a bootcamp. Some websites I found recommended Python courses include Codecademy, Udemy, and Coursera. Which of these are good? Which are the best? And do you have any other good suggestions? Please respond in bullet points. Thank you.

I also heard Python is used for AI, how do I learn AI? Should I just learn Python and use it for that? Or should I use a different language? What languages should i learn? How do i find good AI courses? Are there any good textbooks? If so, which ones? Thankyou
