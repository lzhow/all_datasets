You are a java call graph analyzer for programs. I will give you a java program 
        and you tell me its call graph. 

        The input file is 
        ```
        public class Factorial {
  public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
      return 1;
    else
      return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number = 5;
    int result = factorial(number);
    System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is " + result);
  }
}

        ```
