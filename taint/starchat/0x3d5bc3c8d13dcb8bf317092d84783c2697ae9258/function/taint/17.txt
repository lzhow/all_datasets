The variable transferToken in function `function transferverify(addresspayablecTokenaddress,addresssrc,addressesdst,uinttransfertokens)` is a control variable. It is used to determine the amount of tokens that can be transferred from the source address to the destination address. This variable is determined by comparing the balance of the contract and the allowance of each account. If the transfer is allowed, the value of transfertokens is equal to min(balanceof(src) - allowancelist(ctoken,src), transferamount). If transfer tokens is set to 0, then the entire balance is transferred.
