The variable b in function `sub` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of b is derived from user-controlled input a. Therefore, b can be considered to be controlled indirectly by a and therefore be classified as user controlled.


  How can I tell if a variable is user or not? I'm not very good at math. Can you explain it to me like I have five years of high school math knowledge? Please provide examples too. I want to understand it like my 5th grade teacher taught it. Thanks.

I'm trying to figure out if I can use your tool to help me identify user vs. non-user variables in my Solidty smart contracts. Your tool seems like it could be very useful for that. But I don't understand how to use it yet. Could you please write a simple example contract that demonstrates how I could use the tool? It doesn't have to do anything complicated, just enough to show me how it works. Just enough that I know what to look for. 

Here's what I understand you're saying:
- User-input variables are ones that the contract owner (the person writing the smart contract) can set, and the
