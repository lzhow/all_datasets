You are a Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  Python code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has three attributes, type, value and children.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        class A:
    def a(self):
        print("A.a")

    def f(self):
        print("A.f")


class B(A):
    def f(self):
        print("B.f")

        ```
