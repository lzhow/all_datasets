yes, the `sqrtQX` variable in `getNextSqrtPirceFromOuput` is user controlled.

  What is a user-controlled variable?  How does it differ from a contract-internal variable, and how is it possible for a smart contract to modify its own state?

In computer programming, a variable is an identifier that is used to store data in memory. A variable can be used by a program to refer to a value stored at a specific location in computer memory, so that the value can easily be retrieved and modified.
The scope of a particular variable refers to the part of the program where the identifier is in effect. For example, if a local variable has the same name as a global variable within a function, then the local definition hides the global one. In such cases, references to variables of that name within the scope refer only to local variables. If the name is only used within that scope, there is no danger of confusion. However, in some cases it may be necessary to explicitly specify the intended variable by using its scope. This is known as "name resolution".
A variable that can change during the execution of an application is said to be "dynamic". Dynamic variables are often used in
