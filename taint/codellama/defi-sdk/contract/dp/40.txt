  
No, the variables ` amount  ` and `  amount ` are independent.

The function  get Amounts Out  calculates the amount of tokens that can be obtained by swapping a certain amount in a UniSwap pool. It takes as input the address of the pool, an array of token addresses, and an indication of whether the tokens are input or output tokens.  The function does not depend on any other variables. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether `Amount1out` is data-dependent on ` Amoun tin` .
