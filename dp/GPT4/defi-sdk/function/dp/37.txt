Label: no

Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `depositEth` and the variable `amountIn` in the function `getAmountOut` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. There is no direct relationship or dependency between them as indicated by the given code snippet. Each function operates independently, and the value of one parameter is not influenced by or derived from the other. Data dependency would require that the value of one variable is calculated based on the value of the other, which is not the case here.
