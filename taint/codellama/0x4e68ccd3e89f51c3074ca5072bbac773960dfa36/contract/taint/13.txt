  
No, the ` fee Grow thGlobal  ` variable in function `cross` is uncontrolled by user because it's a global variable that is passed as an argument to the cross function.

The ` cross` function is a public function that takes in several arguments, including ` feegrowtheGlobal `, which is an external variable. This means that the value of ` f eegroth Global ` is determined by external factors and cannot be controlled directly by a user calling the contract. Therefore, `f ee G rowth Glob al` cannot  be considered controlled  by  the  user  and  is labeled as 'No'.
