Reason: The variable `amountInWithFee` in the function `getAmountOut` is calculated using the variable `amountIn` and a constant value (997), which represents the fee percentage used in the calculation. It is not directly dependent on the variable `pair`. The variable `pair` is used to fetch the reserves (`reserveIn` and `reserveOut`) from the Uniswap pair contract, which are then used in the calculation of `amountOut`. The dependency of `amountInWithFee` is solely on `amountIn` and the constant fee value, not on the `pair` variable or the reserves fetched using it.
