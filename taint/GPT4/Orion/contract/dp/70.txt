Reason: The contract state `factory` is an immutable state variable that is set once during contract deployment and cannot be changed afterwards. It represents the address of the factory contract. On the other hand, the variable `amounts` in the function `_swap` is a local variable that is used to store the amounts of tokens to be swapped at each step of a multi-token swap operation. The value of `amounts` is determined by the parameters of the swap operation and the state of the pools involved in the swap, not by the `factory` state variable. There is no code within the `_swap` function or elsewhere in the contract that changes the value of `factory` based on the value of `amounts` or vice versa. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `factory` and `amounts`.
