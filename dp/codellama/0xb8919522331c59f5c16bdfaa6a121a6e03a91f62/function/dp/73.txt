  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `target` variable is passed as an argument to the `_verifycallResult` function. This function returns a `bytes` memory object, which is assigned to `returnData`. The `success` and `errorMessage` variables are also passed to this function as arguments.
Since the return value of the`_verifycalResult ` function is dependent on ` retu rnda t a` , the data of ` data` is also dependent  on` ret u rn d a t  a`.
Similarly, in  the second function , ` target`is passed  as  an  argument  to  `_ verifyCall Result` . This  function  returns  ` bytes`memory  object , which  is   assigned  t o  returnData . The  success  and  error  message  variables  are  also  passed   to   this  f u n c t i o n  s  o s .
 Since  th e  ret urn  v a l u e   of  _ verifycal Result  i s   dependent   on  r et u nd a  ta ,  d at a   o f  data  Is  dependent oN  re tu r n d  at  .
