  
No, the variables `_ name` and `_ after` are independent in this function.

The variable`_name `is a parameter of the constructor function and is passed as an argument when the contract is created. It is a constant value that is set when creating the smart contract.  The variable ` _ after ` is declared in function` deposite ` and it is used to calculate the amount of tokens that can be deposited. However, this variable is calculated based on other variables in that function, such as `balanace`and `wanth`, which are also independent of `_ _ name`. Therefore, `__ name `and `_ __ after _`are not dependent on each other.
