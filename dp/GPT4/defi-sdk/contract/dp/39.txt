Yes

The variable `amountsIn` in the function `getAmountsIn` is data dependent on the variable `reserveIn` in the function `getReserves`. This is because `amountsIn` is calculated based on the return value of the `getAmountIn` function, which in turn calls `getReserves` to obtain `reserveIn` and `reserveOut`. The calculation of `amountIn` uses `reserveIn` to determine the amount of input tokens required given an amount of output tokens (`amountOut`) and the reserves in the liquidity pool (`reserveIn` and `reserveOut`). Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `amountsIn` and `reserveIn` as the value of `amountsIn` is influenced by the value of `reserveIn`.
