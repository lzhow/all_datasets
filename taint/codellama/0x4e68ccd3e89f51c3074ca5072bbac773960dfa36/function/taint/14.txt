  
No, the ` last` variable in function `write` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is assigned a value from the array `self` which is a storage variable.

The ` self` array is declared as a `storage` type, which means that it stores its data on the blockchain. Therefore, any changes made to the elements of the storage array are permanent and cannot be altered by any user action.
