  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `getAbsolutInputAmout` function is called with the parameters `Input.TokenAmont` and `SwapDescriptions.Account`. The `Token Amount` is a struct that contains the token address and the amount of tokens. Therefore, `InitialInput Balance`, which is calculated by subtracting the current balance of the input token from the initial balance, is dependent on `Inpu. TokenAmount` because it is used to calculate the absolute input amount.
Similarly, in function two,  `handleInput`is called, which also uses ` Input. tokenAmount`. Therefore ` InitialInput balance` depends on both ` input`and `swapDescription`.
