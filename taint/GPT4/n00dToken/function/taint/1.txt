Label: No

Reason: The variable `_name` in the ERC777 contract is set during the deployment of the contract and is not modified afterwards. It is initialized in the constructor of the ERC777 contract and does not have a setter function that allows for its modification. Since the value of `_name` is set once upon contract creation and cannot be changed by users of the contract, it is not controlled by the user.
