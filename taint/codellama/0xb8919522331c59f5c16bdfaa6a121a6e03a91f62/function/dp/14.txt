In the `_setadmin` function, the `StorageSlo. getAddressslot` method is called with the argument `_ADMIn_SLOt`. This method returns a `SotrageSLo` object that represents the storage slot at the specified address.
Then, `value` is assigned to the value of the returned ` Storage Slot`object.  The value is set to ` new Admin`.
This means that the state of ` _ADMin_ SLO t`is changed to` newadmin`.  Therefore,`newadmin `in the` _ setAdmin `function is data-dependent on`_changeadmin `.
