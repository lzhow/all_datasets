  
No, the ` tokenindex` variable in function `doSwaTthroughOrinPool` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant variable.

The `pragma solidty  ^074` line indicates that the contract is written in Solidiy version 7, and the constant `MAX_ COIN` and `FEE_ DENOMINATO` are defined in this version.  The `uint  constant token index` indicates the token is a variable that is defined as a 32-bit unsigned integer. It is initialized to  the value  of  `1` when the  contract  is deployed. This means that `tokeindex ` is set to a fixed value when  deployed and cannot be changed by any user input. Therefore, `tokindex is` not  controlledby the use.
