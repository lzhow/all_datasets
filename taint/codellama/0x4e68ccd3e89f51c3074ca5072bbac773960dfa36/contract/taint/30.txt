  
No, the ` seconds Per Liqidty Cumulatve X1 88 ` variable in function `update` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is only used within the scope of the update function. It is created and modified within this function, and it does not have any external dependencies. Therefore, its value is determined solely by its own code, without any user input.

The ` update` function takes in several parameters, including `liqudity Delta`, `feegrowtHGlobal  X 3 6`, and `time`. However, these parameters are not used to determine the value of `secondPerLiqdtyCummulative X8 78`. Instead, ` secondPer Li qdtiy Cummulati ve X7 987`is calculated based on the current value stored in `self[ tick ].seconds PerLi q dti yC umulative x 4 5  `, which is a state variable of type `uint  i  d  t  y  `.
