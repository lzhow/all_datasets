yes

The contract state `_totalSupply` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `mint`. This is because the `mint` function directly modifies `_totalSupply` by adding the `amount` to it using the `_mint` internal function. The `_mint` function is defined as follows:

```solidity
function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
    require(account != address(0), "ERC20: mint to the zero address");
    _beforeTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
    _totalSupply = _totalSupply.add(amount);
    _balances[account] = _balances[account].add(amount);
    emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);
}
```

As you can see, `_totalSupply` is increased by the value of `amount` with the line `_totalSupply = _totalSupply.add(amount);`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `_totalSupply` and `amount` within the `mint` function.
