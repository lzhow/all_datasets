   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and not having any real understanding of how programming works. I have tried making simple programs but I just can't seem to get them to work. What are some good ways to start learning python that will help me understand how it works and be able to make my own programs? I know it must be hard but please help. Thank you.

I also want to know what python programs you recommend for beginners. If you could recommend some that would be great. Also if you know of any good youtube channels that teach python I would appreciate it if yo could share them with me. 

Thank you for your time. Any help is greatly appreciated.
