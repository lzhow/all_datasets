Yes, the variable `amounts` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is data dependent on the variable `initialTransferSource` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of `amounts` is modified inside the block of code where `initialTransferSource` is used. The value of `amounts[0]` is assigned the difference between the balance of `swapData.path[0]` in `initialTransferSource` before and after the `safeAutoTransferFrom` function call. Therefore, the value of `amounts` depends on the value of `initialTransferSource`.
