Label: no

Reason: The variable `liquidity` is calculated within the `mint` function using local variables and parameters such as `amount0`, `amount1`, `_totalSupply`, `_reserve0`, and `_reserve1`. The contract state `decimals` is not referenced or used in any of the calculations or logic that determine the value of `liquidity`. Since there is no interaction or use of `decimals` in the computation or assignment of `liquidity`, there is no data dependency relationship between `decimals` and `liquidity`.
