Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `createReceipt` is assigned the value of `userAccumulatedAlpha[msg.sender]`, where `msg.sender` represents the address of the entity (user) calling the function. Since `msg.sender` is inherently controlled by the user who initiates the transaction, and `userAccumulatedAlpha` is a mapping that tracks the accumulated Alpha tokens for each user, the `amount` variable indirectly depends on the actions taken by the user. The user can influence this value by calling the `accumulateAlphaToUser` function with their address, which affects their balance in the `userAccumulatedAlpha` mapping. Therefore, the `amount` variable in the `createReceipt` function is controlled by the user.
