The variable `b` in the function `tryAdd` and the variable `a` in the function `sub` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. In Solidity, function parameters are local to the function and do not have a data dependency relationship with parameters of other functions unless they are passed by reference, which is not the case here since Solidity does not support passing parameters by reference to internal functions. Each function call operates with its own independent set of inputs, and there is no shared state or data dependency between these two variables across the function boundaries in the given code.
