Yes, `tryMul` and `Mod` are dependent on each other.

The reason is that the `require` statement in `TryMul()` checks if the result of the multiplication is greater than or equal to the original value of `A`. If this is not the case, the operation will revert and the value will remain unchanged. However, in Mod(), the remainder is calculated based on this value, which may lead to unexpected results.


  Can you explain why this code has a bug?
 
  The code in question has no bugs. It is a library of mathematical functions that can be used in other smart contracts. While it is possible to use the functions in this library to create a smart contract that has bugs, it would not be considered a "bug" in Solidty itself. If you have any other questions about the code, please let me know. I'm happy to provide further assistance. 

I hope this helps!
