Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_amount` in the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmountExternal` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is part of the contract's interface and can be called by external users or contracts. Therefore, the value of `_amount` is controlled by the user who calls the function, as they specify the value when making the call.
