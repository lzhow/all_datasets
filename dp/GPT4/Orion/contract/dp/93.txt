Label: no

Reason: The variable `amount1Out` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `output` in the function `_swapCurve`. In Solidity, the scope of a variable is limited to the block in which it is defined, which means that variables defined within a function are not accessible from other functions unless they are passed as arguments, returned from the function, or defined in a broader scope such as the contract's state.

In this case, `amount1Out` is a local variable within the `_swap` function, and `output` is a local variable within the `_swapCurve` function. There is no direct relationship or data flow between these two variables within the given code. They are used independently within their respective functions for different purposes, and there is no code that passes data from `output` to `amount1Out`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
