  
The variable 'bitpos' in function 'nextInitialisedTicksWithOneword' is 'not controlled' by user because it's a local variable and it doesn't have any user input.

In the code, the 'position' function is called to get the word position and bit position of the tick. These values are then used to calculate the next initialized tick within one word. However, these values do not come from user inputs, so the bitpos variable is also not user-controlled.
