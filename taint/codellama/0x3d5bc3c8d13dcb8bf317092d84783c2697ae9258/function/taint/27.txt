In the `Comtroller` interface, the contract has a function called `enterMarketing` that takes an array of `cToken` addresses as input. This function is called by a user to enter the market and start earning interest on their deposits.
Similarly, there are other functions like `exitMarking`, `mintAllow`, and `redeeem` which are also called directly by users. These functions are responsible for managing the state of the smart contract and are therefore controlled directly or indirectly by user input or actions.
