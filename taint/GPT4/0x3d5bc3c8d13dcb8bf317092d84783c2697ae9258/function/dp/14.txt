The variable `error` in the function `addExp` is data dependent on the variable `a` in the function `mulExp3` because the result of `addExp` is influenced by the inputs `a` and `b`. In `mulExp3`, the function `mulExp` is called with `a` and `b` as arguments, and the result of this multiplication is then used as an argument in the subsequent call to `mulExp` along with `c`. Since `addExp` is used to calculate the intermediate result `ab` in `mulExp3`, and `a` is one of the inputs to this calculation, there is a data dependency between `error` and `a`. If `a` changes, it could potentially change the result of the multiplication, which in turn could affect the outcome of `addExp` and the value of `error`.
