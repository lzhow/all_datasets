  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the code, the `latestroundData()` function is called on `pricFeed`, which is a contract variable. This function returns a tuple of values, including the price.
Then, a new variable called `_price` is created and assigned the value of the returned price multiplied by  `1*1e16`.
Finally, `_sellenftfeeeth` and `buynft feeeth`, are calculated based on `_ price` using the division operator.  Therefore, ` _ price ` is data-dependent on  the return value from ` latestrounddata()`.
