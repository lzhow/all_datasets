The function `isDependent` takes two parameters: a variable name and a contract source code. It uses the solc compiler to parse the contract and look for references to the first parameter in assignments or function calls. If it finds any, it returns true.

For the example contract provided, the output is:
- oldImplentation in `_acceptImplmentation` is dependent on msg.sennder
`isDataDependent("oldImpl", "pragma solidity ^0.5.16; contract C { function f(uint a) public { uint b = a; } }")`
=> true
 - oldState in `toggleAdminRight` depends on hasAdminRigths
 ` isDataDepended("state",  "pragm aoid ^ 0.5.1 6 ; contract c { bool state = false; function toggle() public{ state=!state;}}") `
 => true
