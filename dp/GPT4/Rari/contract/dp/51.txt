Reason: The variable `supplier` in the function `distributeSupplierComp` and the variable `contributor` in the function `_setContributorCompSpeed` are used in different contexts and for different purposes within the smart contract. The `supplier` variable is used to calculate and distribute rewards to suppliers of the protocol based on their supply balance and the supply index. On the other hand, the `contributor` variable is used to set the speed at which rewards are distributed to a specific contributor to the protocol.

There is no direct interaction or dependency between these two variables within the given functions. The `distributeSupplierComp` function is concerned with the distribution of rewards to suppliers, while the `_setContributorCompSpeed` function is concerned with setting the reward distribution speed for a particular contributor. They operate independently of each other, and changes to one do not affect the other. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
