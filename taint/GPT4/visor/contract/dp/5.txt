The variable `account` in the function `isContract` is not data dependent on the variable `target` in the function `functionDelegateCall`. In Solidity, data dependency implies that the value of one variable is somehow derived from or influenced by the value of another variable. In this case, `account` is an input parameter for the `isContract` function, which checks whether the provided address is a contract. On the other hand, `target` is an input parameter for the `functionDelegateCall` function, which is used to perform a delegate call to another contract. There is no direct relationship or computation in the code provided that links the value of `account` to the value of `target`, and they are used independently within their respective functions.
