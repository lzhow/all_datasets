Explanation: The variable `bitPos` in the function `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord` is not controlled by the user. It is derived from the computation of the `tick` parameter and the `tickSpacing` parameter. The value of `bitPos` is determined by the result of the `position` function, which is an internal function within the `TickBitmap` library. The `position` function calculates the `wordPos` and `bitPos` based on the `tick` parameter. Since the `tick` parameter is not controlled by the user and the `position` function is internal to the library, the `bitPos` variable is not controlled by the user.
