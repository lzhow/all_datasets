  
No, the variables `_mLastK` and `_toke0n` are independent.

The variable ` _ klast` is a local variable in function `_ mintF ee` that is used to calculate the liquidty fee. It is not dependent on any external variable.  On the other hand, variable` _ token  ` is an argument of the ` sk im` function that represents the token address. However, it is also a private variable of `PanaceaPair` contract, and it does not affect the calculation of `_ k last`. Therefore, `_ token` doesnot affect `_ m last k`.
