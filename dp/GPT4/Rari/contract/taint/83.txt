The variable `i` in the function `_setCompSpeeds` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `i` is used as a loop counter in a for loop. Its value is determined by the length of the `cTokens` array, which is passed as an argument to the function. The user does not have control over the length of the `cTokens` array, so the value of `i` is not controlled by the user.
