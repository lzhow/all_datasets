Also, can you give me a list of all the modifiers that are available to me? Can I use them in any order? What are the rules for using them?

Can you also give an example of a function that uses a user modifier? Thankyou. 

I'm sorry if these are simple questions, I just want to understand them better so that I know what to expect when I start writing my smart contracts. If you could explain them to my in a way that is easy to follow, that
