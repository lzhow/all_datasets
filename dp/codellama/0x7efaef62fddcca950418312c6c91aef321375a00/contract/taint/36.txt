  
No, the `sucess` variable in `_safeTranfer` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a local variable that is assigned a value based on the result of the external call to the token contract.

The `safeTrasnfer()` function is used to transfer tokens from the Panacea contract to another address. It first checks if there is enough balance in Panacaea to cover the transfer, and if so, makes the call using the ERC-231 standard `transer()` method. If the transaction is successful, `true` will be assigned to `succeess`, otherwise `false` wil be assinged to it.  The `require` statement at the end of `_safetransfer()`, which checks that the transer was successful and throws an error if it was not, will only be executed if ` success`is ` true`. Therefore, if a user tries to manipulate the value of ` sucess`, it will not affect the execution of this function.
