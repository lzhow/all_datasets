  
No, the ` total Supply By Partitions` contract is not dependent on `_ value` variable in ` transfer` function.

The ` _ value ` variable is used to calculate the new balance of the `_ to` address in `_add Token To Partiton` method, but it is never used in calculating the total supply of tokens. Therefore, `TotalSuppliesBy Partions` is independent of `_ Value`.
