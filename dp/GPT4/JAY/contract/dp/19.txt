Yes

The variable `total` in the function `buyJay` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155`. This is because `total` is used to accumulate the total number of NFTs being bought, and it is incremented by the return value of the `buyJayWithERC1155` function, which calculates the sum of the `amounts` array representing the quantity of each ERC1155 token being bought. The relevant code snippet from the `buyJay` function is:

```solidity
if (erc1155TokenAddress.length != 0)
    total = total.add(
        buyJayWithERC1155(erc1155TokenAddress, erc1155Ids, erc1155Amounts)
    );
```

And the `buyJayWithERC1155` function returns the sum of the `amounts` array:

```solidity
function buyJayWithERC1155(
    address[] calldata _tokenAddress,
    uint256[] calldata ids,
    uint256[] calldata amounts
) internal returns (uint256) {
    uint256 amount = 0;
    for (uint256 id = 0; id < ids.length; id++) {
        amount = amount.add(amounts[id]);
        // ...
    }
    return amount;
}
```

Therefore, the final value of `total` in `buyJay` is dependent on the values within the `amounts` array passed to `buyJayWithERC1155`.
