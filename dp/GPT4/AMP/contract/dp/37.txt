The contract state `_indexOfTotalPartitions` is data dependent on the variable `_partition` in the function `transferByPartition`. This is because `_indexOfTotalPartitions` is a mapping that keeps track of the index of a given partition in the `_totalPartitions` array. In the `transferByPartition` function, the `_partition` variable is used to determine the partition from which tokens are being transferred. If the balance of the partition becomes zero after the transfer, the `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions` function is called, which uses `_indexOfTotalPartitions` to find and remove the partition from `_totalPartitions`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_indexOfTotalPartitions` and `_partition` within the context of the `transferByPartition` function.
