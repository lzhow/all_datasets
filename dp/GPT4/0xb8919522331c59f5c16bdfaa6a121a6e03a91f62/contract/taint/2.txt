Label: No

Reason: The variable `implementation` in the function `upgradeAndCall` is an argument passed to the function. However, the function `upgradeAndCall` is restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that only the owner of the contract (as determined by the state variable `_owner` in the `Ownable` contract) can call this function and specify the `implementation` address. Since the owner is typically a specific account set during contract deployment or transferred through controlled means, and not any arbitrary user, the `implementation` variable is not controlled by any user but rather by the owner of the contract. Therefore, it is not user-controlled.
