The variable amount is a user input and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a tool that can help me identify user-controlled variables?

I'm looking for a way to identify if any of the variables in my Solidty smart contract are user controllable.  I want to know how to do this without having to manually look at each variable.
Is there an automated tool I can use to scan my contract and identify these variables for me?   If so, please provide a link to the tool and a description of how it works.   I would appreciate it if you could also describe the types of vulnerabilities that the automated tools can detect. 

Thank you for your help. I'm new to Solidit and smart contracts and I'd like to learn as much as I possibly can.
