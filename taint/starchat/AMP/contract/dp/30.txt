The contract has a function called `transfer` that transfers `_value` of the token from `_token` to `_to`. The function `_transferDefaultPartition` is called by `transfers` and it transfers the `_amount` from the sender's address to the receiver's.

In the `Amp` contract, the total supply is stored in `_balances` mapping. In the swap function, we are transferring the allowances of `SwapToken` which is an external contract to `msgSender` address. Since the transfer is external, it is not a part of contract's state and does not affect the state of `_balance` or `_allowances`.
Therefore, `_balanceOf` doesnot depend on `_operator` variable.
