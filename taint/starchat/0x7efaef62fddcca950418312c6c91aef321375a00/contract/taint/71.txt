   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers is any tool that takes a set of files that make up a web application and combines them into a single file that can be served to a user's browser. Incremental bundl[ing] is different from traditional bundlings in that it only updates the portions of the code that have changed since the last time the bund[ler] was run. This makes it much faster than a traditional bundle, as it can avoid re-bundling large libraries that haven't changed.
This is achieved by using a technique called "tree-shaking" which involves removing code from the bundle that isn't actually used by your application. For example, if you're using the lodash library
