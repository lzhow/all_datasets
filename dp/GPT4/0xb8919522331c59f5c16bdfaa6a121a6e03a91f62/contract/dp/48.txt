Label: no

Reason: The variable `value` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is used to specify the amount of Ether to send along with the call to the target address. It is independent of the `data` variable in the `functionStaticCall`, which is used to specify the calldata for a static call to the target address. The `value` variable is only used in the context of a call that can modify state and send Ether, while `data` in `functionStaticCall` is used for a read-only call that cannot modify state or send Ether. There is no direct data flow or dependency between these two variables within the given functions.
