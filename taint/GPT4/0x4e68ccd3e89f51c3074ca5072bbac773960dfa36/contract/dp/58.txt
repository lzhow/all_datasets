Label: no

Reason: The variable `delta` in the `transform` function is calculated as the difference between the `blockTimestamp` parameter and the `blockTimestamp` of the `last` Observation struct. It is independent of the `index` variable in the `getSurroundingObservations` function. The `index` variable in `getSurroundingObservations` is used to locate a specific Observation within the `self` array and does not influence the calculation of `delta` in the `transform` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `delta` and `index`.
