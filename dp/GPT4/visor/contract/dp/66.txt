Reason: The variable `success` in the function `_verifyCallResult` is a local variable that is determined by the outcome of the `staticcall` performed in the `functionStaticCall` function. The `success` variable is used to check whether the `staticcall` was successful or not and is passed directly to the `_verifyCallResult` function along with `returndata` and `errorMessage`. However, there is no direct data dependency between the `target` variable in `functionStaticCall` and the `success` variable in `_verifyCallResult` because `success` does not influence the value of `target`, nor is it influenced by `target`. The `target` variable is used to specify the address on which the `staticcall` is performed, while `success` is simply a boolean indicating the result of that call. They operate independently within their respective function scopes and are not used to derive each other's values.
