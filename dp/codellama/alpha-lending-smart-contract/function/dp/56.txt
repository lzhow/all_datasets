  
No, the variables ` user UsePool AsCollatoral ` and `_ amount` are independent.

The variable  `UserUse PoolAs Collatera` is a local variable in function  get UserAccount, and it is not used in any other function. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on any variable.  The variable _ amount is also a parameter in send Alpha Rewards, but it does not affect the value of the local variables in get user account.
