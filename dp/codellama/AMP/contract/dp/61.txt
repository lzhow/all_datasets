  
No, the `amp_tokes_checker` contract is not dependent on ` index` variable in `_ removePartionFromTotlaPartions` function.

The ` _ removeTokenfromTotalpartions ` function removes a partition from the total partitions array and updates the index of the partition in that array. However, this function does not use the value of ` amp_tokens_chcker` or any other variable. Therefore, it is safe to say that ` amptokenser_chkcer` is independent of any variable or state in this contract.
