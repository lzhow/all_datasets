The contract has a function called `_seLiquidatinInceotve` which sets the `liquidationIncenitveMantisa` variable. This variable is used to calculate the rewards that are paid to the liquidators.

In the code, the `_calculateRewards` function is called with the argument `totalDebt` and `rewardRate`. The `rewordRate` is calculated using the formula:
`rewardPerToken = totalReward / totalSupply`
and the total supply is obtained by summing up all the debt of all of the users. 

However, in order to get the reward per token, we need to know the current `pricePerShare`. This is stored in a variable called `accumulativePricePershare`.
This variable gets updated every time a new user deposits or withdraws their debit, or when the price of a share changes.
