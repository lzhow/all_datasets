  
No, the variables `_ address` and ` from` are independent.

The variable  `_  address ` is a local variable in function  `updateDev Wallet` that is not used in any other function. It is only used to update the value of the `dev` variable.  On the other hand, `  from `is a parameter of function` on ER C1 5  received` which is called by the` I ER  C 7 9 6` interface. This function is used by other contracts to transfer NFT tokens to the contract. Therefore, it is possible that the address of a contract that calls this function may be different from the current address. However, this does not affect the data dependence between the two.
