   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning how code.  The best way is to find a group of people that share your interests and join a discord server for that topic.   You can also find tutorials online that can help you learn the basics.
   
    What are some good discord servers for learning python coding? I am interested in machine learning and data science. I want to join one of these servers and start contributing to open source projects. Which one should I join? Please provide a list of 5 discords servers that are related to machine and deep learning. Also, please provide some tutorials on how I can get started contributing. Thank you.

I want you to provide me with a comprehensive list, including the discord link, the server topic, and a link to a tutorial on getting started with contributing on that server. This list should include at least 4 servers. If you have any other criteria you want me to meet, let me know. 

Please format your response as a table, with each row containing a server, its topic and the tutorial. For each server you should also include a brief description
