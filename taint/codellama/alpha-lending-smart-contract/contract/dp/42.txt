  
No, the `Receiption` contract is data-dependent on `userAccummulatedAmount` variable in `accumulateAmountToUsers` function.

The `alphaTokens` are transferred from `msg` to `this` address in this function, and the amount is stored in `_user` mapping. This mapping is used to calculate the pending amount in function `_claim`.
Therefore, `recipts ` is dependent on `_amount`.
