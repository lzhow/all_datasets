Yes, the variable `_oHalt` in the function `enforceHalts` is data dependent on the variable `_oGLiq` in the same function. 

Explanation: In the function `enforceHalts`, the value of `_oHalt` is calculated using the value of `_oGLiq` in the expression `_oGLiq.mul(_weights[i]).mul(_upperAlpha)`. Therefore, the value of `_oHalt` depends on the value of `_oGLiq`.
