In the ` deposits` function, the value of ` shares` is calculated based on ` visrdpos` and ` vvsr` total supply.
` shares= visdpos. mul( vvrs. totalSuppl). div( visb. balanceOf (address (this)))`
This means that the data in ` sharess` depends on data from `vvsrs` as well as `vsrds`.
Therefore, `share` has a dependency on both ` vsrd`and `vdpos`.
