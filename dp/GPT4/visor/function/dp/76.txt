Reason: In Solidity, function scope means that variables declared within a function are not accessible by other functions unless they are passed as arguments or are part of the contract's state (i.e., state variables). In the given code, the variable `a` in the function `tryMod` and the variable `b` in the function `div` are both function arguments, and they are scoped to their respective functions. There is no data dependency between `a` in `tryMod` and `b` in `div` because they are separate instances and their values are independent of each other. Each function call operates on its own set of inputs, and there is no shared state or interaction between these two variables across the function boundaries in the provided code snippet.
