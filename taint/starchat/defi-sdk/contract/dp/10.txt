  How can I check if a variable is dependent or not?
 
  You can check the data dependence relationship between two or more variables by using a technique called sensitivity analysis. This involves evaluating the effect of one or several variables on other variables. If a change in one variable results in a significant change to another variable, then the two are said to be dependent variables, and the relationship is said positive. Conversely, if the change results only in an insignificant change, the variables are called independent variables and have no dependenct relationship with each other.

To perform sensitivity analyses, you can use mathematical models, such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or difference equations, or you may use computer simulations. In either case, it is important to consider the limitations of the models and to ensure that the results are accurate and reliable. Additionally, sensitivity studies should be performed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific requirements and constraints of each system. It is also important that you have access to the original data and that it be stored in such a way that its values can be easily retrieved
