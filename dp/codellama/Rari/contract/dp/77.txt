  
No, the variables ` suppli er` and ` comp Speed` are independent.

The function `distribute Supplier Comp` is called in `flywheelPre Supplier Action`, which is triggered by the `set Comp Supply Speed Internal` function. This means that the value of `compspeed` will be updated before the call to ` distributesuppliercomp`. Therefore, ` comps peed ` is dependent on ` supply state`, but not on` suppl ier`.
