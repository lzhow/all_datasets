Yes

The variable `index` in the function `getSurroundingObservations` is data dependent on the variable `atOrAfter` within the same function. This is because `index` is used to calculate the position of `beforeOrAt` in the array `self`, which is then used to determine the value of `atOrAfter`. Specifically, `atOrAfter` is assigned a value based on the result of the expression `self[(index + 1) % cardinality]`. The value of `index` directly influences which element of the `self` array is accessed to initialize `atOrAfter`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `index` and `atOrAfter`.
