The variable `name` in the constructor function is controlled by the user because it is an input parameter to the constructor. When a contract is deployed, the deployer provides the arguments for the constructor, which means they have control over the value of `name`. This value is then used to initialize the contract's state, in this case, as part of setting up the EIP712 domain separator.
