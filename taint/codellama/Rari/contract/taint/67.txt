The `  _  set Implementation Safe ` function is a public function that is called by an admin to set a new implementation for the contract. This function takes three parameters: ` implementation _ `, ` allow Resign ` and ` become Implementa tion Data `. The ` implementa  t ion _` parameter is set to the address of the new contract implementation, and the other two parameters are used to determine whether the old implementation should be resigned and whether a call to `becom eImplementati on` should  be made.
  The  ` be comeIm plementation ` functio n is an internal function  that  is ca lled  when  a  new  implementati  on  of  th e  contract  i s  se t . This  function sets  up  some  state  variables  and  then  calls  an  external  fun ction  to  perform  any  additional  setup  tasks . The external function can be any function, including ` mint ` , ` re deem ` or ` borrow ` . These functions are not directly controlled b y the u ser , but rather by other functions in th  e contract . Therefore , the vari ab le ` fu seF  feeM an tissa  ' is also not  controlled   by   the   user  .
