  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `TargetSwappData _ swapData;` is a struct that contains the variables `_origin`, `_target`, and `_recipent`. The `CurvedFactory curvefactory` is also a contract variable.
When the `_ swapdata` variable is created, it is assigned the value of the current ` curve factory` contract. This means that the data in ` _swappedata` depends on ` curvedfactory`.
Therefore, `yes` the state of ` Curvefactory ` is data-dependent on `_swapedata`.
