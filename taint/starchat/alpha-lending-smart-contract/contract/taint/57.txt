The variable data in function `decodeBytes` is a reference to a memory location that contains the encoded data to be decoded. Since the data is stored in memory and not on the blockchain, the value of the memory address of data can be modified by any function that has access to the contract's storage. Therefore, data's memory is considered to have control over the decoded data and is therefore classified as "controlled by user".


  Can you explain how the control flow analysis works? I'm not sure I understand how it can determine that data has control.





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain it to me at a level a data scientist can understand.

  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the files that make up a web application into a single file that can then be served to users. This helps reduce the number of requests that the browser needs to make to load the application, which can significantly improve the performance of
