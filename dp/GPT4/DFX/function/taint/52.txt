Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `hashes` in the function `processMultiProof` is not directly controlled by the user. It is an internal variable that is created and manipulated within the function. However, without further context or information about how the `hashes` variable is used or assigned values, it is difficult to determine if it can be influenced or controlled by the user indirectly. Therefore, the label for the variable `hashes` is "unknown".
