Reason: The contract state `WETH` is an immutable state variable that is set once during contract deployment and cannot be changed afterwards. The variable `amountAMin` is a local variable within the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` that is used to determine the minimum amount of token A that must be added to the liquidity pool. There is no code within the `addLiquidityFromExchange` function or elsewhere in the contract that alters the state of `WETH` based on the value of `amountAMin`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `WETH` and `amountAMin`.
