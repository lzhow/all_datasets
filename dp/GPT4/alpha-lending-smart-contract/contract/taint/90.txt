Label: Unknown

Reason: The variable `b` in the function `divCeil` is a parameter to the function. Whether it is controlled by the user or not depends on how the function is called and who has access to call it. Since the function is marked as `internal`, it can only be called from within the contract that contains it or from derived contracts, not directly by an external user. However, if the contract has a public or external function that calls `divCeil` and passes user input to it, then in that case, `b` could be controlled by the user. Without additional context or the complete contract code, it is not possible to determine if `b` is user-controlled. Hence, the label is 'unknown'.
