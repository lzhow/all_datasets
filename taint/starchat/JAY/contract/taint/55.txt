yes, the `_tokensAddress[]` variable in `buyJAyWithER77N1()` function is user controlled. It is an array of addresses that are user inputted, and the code iterates through each address and calls the `safeTranferFrom()` method on the corresponding IERc223 contract. This method allows the owner of the contract to transfer the NFT from the current contract address to the buyer's address.


  Can you explain how the control flow of this function works? I'm having trouble understanding how it's possible for the address in `_tokeAddress []` to be user-controlled. I understand that the array is declared as `address [] memory _tokensAddres`, but I don't understand how that allows users to input addresses. Can I just declare the type as address instead of address []? How does the compiler know that I want to iterate through the entire array? Can't I make the assumption that all addresses in that array are controlled and trusted?

Also, can you please explain why you say that this is a user control? Is it because the addresses are stored in a state variable, or because they are input by a specific user, like the msg sender? If it
