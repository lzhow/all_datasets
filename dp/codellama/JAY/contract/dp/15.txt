  
No, the ` buy Nft Fee Eth` contract variable is not dependent on `_ p_ scope_ â€‹0`.

The ` _ p _ scope _ 4` variable in ` update Fees` is a local variable that is defined within the scope of the method. It is only accessible within that method and is re-initialized each time the  `  update  Fe es` method is called.
Therefore, ` bu yN ftF eeE th` cannot be dependent  on `   _   p  _    s c o p e _4`.
