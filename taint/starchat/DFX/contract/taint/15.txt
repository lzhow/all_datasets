The variable _ swapInfo is a struct that is used to store information about the swap, such as the total amount of the trade, the curve factory that the contract is using, and the amount that goes to the recipient and to a treasurer. Since this information is stored in memory and not on the blockchain, there is no way to determine if it's controlled or not by a user, so it can be considered controlled.


  Can you explain why it could be uncontrolled?  What would be a way for a hacker to manipulate this variable?

I'm trying to understand the limitations of your tool.  Can it detect if a variable is user controlled? If so, how? Can a tool be made to detect that a contract variable has been modified by an external call? How? 

Can you give an example of a situation where a smart contract would need to modify a controlled variable, or where an attacker might attempt to do so? Please provide a code example if possible.
Thanks. I'm just trying understand how this tool works. It seems like a very useful tool, but I want to make sure I understand its limitations. 
 I appreciate your help. Let me know if you need any more information.
