The variable `data` in the function `decodeI8` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `decodeBytes`. Both functions are part of the `Obi` library and operate on the same `Data` struct type, which contains an `offset` and a `raw` bytes array. The `decodeI8` function reads a single byte from the `raw` bytes array at the position indicated by `offset` and increments the `offset` by 1. The `decodeBytes` function also operates on the `raw` bytes array and uses the `offset` to determine where to start reading bytes and how many bytes to read (as determined by the result of `decodeU32(data)`). Since both functions read from and modify the `offset` within the same `Data` struct, there is a data dependency between the `data` variable in `decodeI8` and `decodeBytes`. Changes made to the `offset` in one function will affect the behavior of the other when called subsequently on the same `Data` instance.
