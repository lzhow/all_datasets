  
The variable `token` in function `getbalace` is a parameter of the `Base` contract. It is passed as an argument to the contract when it calls the method. Therefore, the value of ` token` can be controlled only by a user who calls this function.

Therefore, we can label this variable as 'Yes' as it can only be set by user input.
