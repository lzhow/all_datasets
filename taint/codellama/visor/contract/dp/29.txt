  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `Saferc2O` library, the` safe Decreased Allowance ` function calls the `_call Optional Return` function, which calls `token` `approval` with the new allowances as arguments.
`new Allowances` is calculated by subtracting `values` from the current allowences, so it is data-dependent on ` values`.
Therefore, ` new Allowences` and ` value` have data dependencies.
