  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks that the value of `s` is less than or equal to a certain value. This means that if the signature is valid, then the values of the variables `r` and `hash` are also valid. Therefore, `sig` (which is a combination of r and s) is data-dependent on `message` because the validity of sig depends on message.
Similarly, in function 1, we have the same ` require` statements as in Function 3. So, if ` sig`is valid in `function 4`, then ` message` must also be valid because ` r`and ` hash`are also data - dependent on` message`.
Therefore, both ` v`in ` function` recover and` signature` have data dependencies on each other.
