The variable `returndata` in the function `functionStaticCall` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the same function. This is because `returndata` is assigned the result of the `staticcall` operation, which is directly influenced by the `data` variable that is passed to the `staticcall`. The `data` variable contains the encoded function call that is being made to the `target` address. The success of the call and the returned data (`returndata`) are determined by what function is being called and with what parameters, which are encoded in `data`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `returndata` and `data`.
