Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_excessUtilizationRate` in the constructor of the `PoolConfiguration` contract is set by the value passed to the constructor at the time the contract is deployed. This value is provided by the user who deploys the contract, which means it is controlled by the user at the point of contract creation. After deployment, the value of `_excessUtilizationRate` is fixed and cannot be changed unless there is a function within the contract that allows for its modification, which is not present in the given code. Therefore, `_excessUtilizationRate` is initially controlled by the user who deploys the contract.
