In the ` functionfunctioncall` function, the` data` variable is passed as an argument to the internal ` _functioncalldata` method. This method then calls the `_verifycallresult` internal method, which in turn calls `target. call` with the passed ` data`. Therefore, ` target` is data-dependent on `  data`, as it is used as the input to a call.
