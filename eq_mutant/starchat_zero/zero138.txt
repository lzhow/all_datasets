No, the codes provided are **not** semantic equal as they do not have exactly the **same output** when given **the same inputs**. While the code is syntactically and semanticall valid, it does not result in the exact same outcome for any given input values. Additionally, depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm, there can be cases where the mutated code will result **in non-deterministic outcomes**.
