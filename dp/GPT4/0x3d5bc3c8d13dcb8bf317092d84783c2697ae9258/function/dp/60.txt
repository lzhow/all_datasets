Label: no

Reason: The variable `cTokenCollateral` in the function `liquidateBorrowInternal` is a parameter that is passed into the function and is used within the scope of that function. It is not affected by any state changes or variables outside of its scope. The function `_setComptroller` deals with a different aspect of the contract, specifically setting a new comptroller. It does not interact with or modify the `cTokenCollateral` variable. There is no direct data dependency relationship between `cTokenCollateral` and any variable in the `_setComptroller` function, as they operate independently within their respective function scopes and serve different purposes within the contract.
