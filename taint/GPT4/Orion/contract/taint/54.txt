Explanation: The variable `returndata` in the function `_callOptionalReturn` is not directly controlled by the user. It is the return data from the low-level call to the `token` contract. However, without further context or information about the `token` contract and its behavior, it is not possible to determine if the user has control over the value of `returndata`.
