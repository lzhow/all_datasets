The variable `r` in the function `getTickAtSqrtRatio` is data dependent on the variable `sqrtPriceX96` because `r` is directly assigned a value based on `sqrtPriceX96`. Specifically, `r` is initialized with the expression `uint256(sqrtPriceX96) << 32`, which shifts the value of `sqrtPriceX96` left by 32 bits. This means that any changes to `sqrtPriceX96` will directly affect the value of `r`, establishing a clear data dependency relationship between the two variables.
