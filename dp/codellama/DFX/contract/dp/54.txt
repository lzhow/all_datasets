  
No, the variables `x` and `y` are local variables in function  ` mintadd` , and they do not depend on any external variables. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.

In the first function, `getGrosLliquidtyAndBallances`, the local variable  `_bal` is assigned the value of `Assililator.ViewNumereireBalaance` which is a function call that takes in two arguments, `_baseweight`  and `_quoteweight`. The values of these arguments are determined by the values in `curv.weight[2]` and  curv. weight[3]`, which are both local to the `proportionaldelpoyment` function.  Therefore the `_ bal` variable is dependent on ` curv` .
