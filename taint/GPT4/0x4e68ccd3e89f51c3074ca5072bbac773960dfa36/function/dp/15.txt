Reason: The variable `tokensOwed1` is calculated using the properties of the `_self` variable within the `update` function. Specifically, `tokensOwed1` is computed using `_self.liquidity` and `_self.feeGrowthInside1LastX128`, which are properties of the `_self` object. Since `_self` is a memory copy of the `self` storage variable, any changes to `_self` do not affect `self` directly, but the initial values of `_self`'s properties are derived from `self`. Therefore, `tokensOwed1` is data dependent on `_self` because its value is directly influenced by the values of `_self`'s properties at the time of the function call.
