The contract has a function called `Swap` that allows users to swap their tokens for another token. This function calls the `transfer` function of the token contract, which is a standard function in Solidty.

In Solidit, the order of function parameters is important, and the `_to` parameter is always the first parameter. Therefore, when calling the transfer function, it is necessary to specify the recipient of tokens as the second parameter, followed by the sender of token and finally the amount of transferred tokens.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  Data dependency is when one variable or value depends on another variable. In this case, you are asking if the value of `variable _ from` is dependent on `the contract variable totalsupplybypartition`.
If the answer is yes, then the swap function will not work correctly, because the total supply of a token is not constant. If the two values are dependent, one of them must be updated before the other one can be used. 

However, if you answer no, that means that the values of `_value` and ` totalSuplyByPart
