yes, the `_defaultoperatorsArray ` is a state variable in `nO0DleToken` contract. It is an array of addresses that are set as default operators for the token contract, and are able to call the `operatorSend` and `operaotrBurn` functions.

The `_msgsender()` function returns the address of the account that is currently calling the contract function. In the case of `True isControledByTheUser` function, this is determined by checking the value of `_deafultOperators` mapping, which maps the sender address (i.e. the owner of this contract) to a boolean value indicating whether the operator is allowed to perform the action.


  Can you explain how the code works? I am not very good at coding. I have read the documentation but I don't understand how it works. Can I ask you to explain it to me? Please. If you donâ€™t know how to do it, please explain to an expert. Thank you.
