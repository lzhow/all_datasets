The contract state `pools` is data dependent on the variable `pool` in the function `setPoolReserves`. The reason is that `pool` is a reference to a specific `Pool` struct within the mapping `pools` at the key `address(_token)`. When `pool.poolReserves` is assigned `_amount`, it directly updates the `poolReserves` property of the `Pool` struct within the `pools` mapping. Therefore, any changes to `pool` will affect the state of `pools`, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
