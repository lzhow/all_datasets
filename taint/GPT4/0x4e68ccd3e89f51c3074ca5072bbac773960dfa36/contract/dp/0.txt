Yes

The variable `r` in the function `binarySearch` is data dependent on the variable `index` in the function `observeSingle`. This is because `r` is initialized as `l + cardinality - 1`, where `l` is calculated as `(index + 1) % cardinality`. The value of `index` is passed from `observeSingle` to `binarySearch` and directly influences the calculation of `l`, which in turn affects the value of `r`. Therefore, any changes to `index` will affect the computation of `r`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
