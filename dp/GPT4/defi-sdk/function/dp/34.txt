The variable `amountsIn` in the function `getAmountsIn` is data dependent on the variable `amountOut` in the function `getAmountIn`. This is because `amountsIn` is being assigned values based on the output of the `getAmountIn` function, which takes `amountOut` as a parameter. The loop within `getAmountsIn` iterates over the indices of `amountsIn` and calls `getAmountIn` with `amountsIn[i]` (which initially contains the value of `amountOut` passed to `getAmountsIn`) as an argument. The return value of `getAmountIn`, which is directly influenced by its `amountOut` parameter, is then used to set the value of `amountsIn[prev]`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `amountsIn` and `amountOut` across these function calls.
