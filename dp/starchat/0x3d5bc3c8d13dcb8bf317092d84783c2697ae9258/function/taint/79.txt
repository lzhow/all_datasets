The variable "scalar" in function "divScalar" is user-controlled. This is because the value of "b" (the scalar value to divide by) is provided by a user, and can be influenced by external factors such as network conditions or other variables.


  How can I make sure that the scalar variable is indeed user controlled? Is there a way to check if a variable has been tampered with? How do I prevent that? Can you give me some examples of how to do that in Solidty? I am a beginner and would really appreciate it if you could explain it in a simple way. Thank you in advance!





   What is a good way of pronouncing the name of the game in English?  I want to play on a kids computer and I don't want it to sound too difficult.  Please suggest different ways that I could pronouce the words "settlers of catan" and provide some tips on how I can do it.   I know English is hard, please donâ€™t make it any harder than it needs to be.    Thanks. I appreciate your help. - Johnny
