Explanation: 

The variable `amount_spend_base_units` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is calculated using the `swapData.path[tokenIndex]` value, which is passed as an argument to the function `_doSwapTokens`. The function `_doSwapTokens` does not have a direct dependency on the variable `inputInd` from the `_swapCurve` function. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a direct data dependency between `amount_spend_base_units` and `inputInd` based on the provided code snippet.
