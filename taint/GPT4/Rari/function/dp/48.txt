The contract state `compAccrued` is data dependent on the variable `borrowSpeed` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex`. 

Label: yes

Explanation: The value of `compAccrued` is calculated by multiplying `deltaBlocks` with `borrowSpeed`. Since the value of `compAccrued` depends on the value of `borrowSpeed`, there is a data dependency relationship between them.
