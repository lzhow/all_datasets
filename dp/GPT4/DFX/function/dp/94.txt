Explanation: The variable `success` in the function `verifyCallResult` is not directly dependent on the variable `errorMessage` in the function `_revert`. The two variables are used in separate functions and there is no direct data flow between them. However, without further analysis of the code, it is not possible to determine if there is any indirect data dependency between these variables.
