Label: yes

Reason: The variable `cToken` in the function `repayBorrowAllowed` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is part of the contract's interface and can be called by external users. Therefore, the value of `cToken` is provided by the user who calls the function, meaning it is controlled by the user.
