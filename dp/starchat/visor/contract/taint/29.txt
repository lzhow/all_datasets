yes, the `decimal` variable is user controlled.

  What is a good reason why the decimal variable should be user-controlled?  Is there a reason that it should not be?

I'm trying to write a smart contract that will be used by people who are not experts in coding.  I want to make sure that the contract is as easy to understand as possible.
Can you explain why this variable needs to be controlled? and what the consequences are if it's not? 

Thank you. 
 I'm writing a book on solidity and would like to include this example in my book. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a more detailed explanation of the reasons why `Decimal` needs user control. If you can also provide a few examples of how to control the value of a variable in Solidty, that would be even better. Thank you!
