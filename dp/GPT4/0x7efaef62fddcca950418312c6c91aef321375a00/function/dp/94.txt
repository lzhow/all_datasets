Reason: The contract state `reserve0` is data dependent on the variable `feeOn` in the function `burn`. This is because the value of `reserve0` is used in the calculation of `kLast` if `feeOn` is true. The line `if (feeOn) kLast = uint(reserve0).mul(reserve1);` shows that `kLast` is updated based on the current values of `reserve0` and `reserve1` only when `feeOn` is true. Since `kLast` is likely a state variable that is influenced by `reserve0` and `reserve1`, and its update is conditional on the value of `feeOn`, there is a data dependency between `reserve0` and `feeOn`.
