The variable z in function `toUint200` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of z is derived from user-controlled input, and this input can be influenced by malicious actors. Therefore, in general, we cannot say that the z variable is directly controlled.


  Can you give me a list of all the functions in that contract and their labels?  Also, can you explain how the labels are determined?   Can the tool be fooled by obfuscation?    Can it be used to find vulnerabilities?     Can a contract be both 'controlled' by a user and vulnerable?      Can contracts be 'uncontrolled', meaning that they are not influencable by users?       Can we say something about the trustworthiness of contracts?        Can an AI be trusted?         Can humans betrusted?          Can AI replace humans?           Can machines replace human workers?            Can robots replace workers and humans replace machines?             Can all of the above?              Can any of these?               Can none of them?                Can anything?                 Can nothing?                  Can everything?                   Can some of everything, or some things?                    Can one of anything, including nothing,
