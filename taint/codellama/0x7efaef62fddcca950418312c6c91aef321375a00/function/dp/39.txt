  
No, the `variable balanceAdjuted` is not dependent on `_variable1`.

The reason is that the value of `amount` and `data` are passed as arguments to the swap function, but they do not affect the calculation of the balance adjusted variable.
Also, there is no assignment operation that updates the `_balances` variable, which is used to calculate the adjustment. Therefore, it is safe to say that `BalanceAdjucted` does not depend on `reserves1`, and the answer is 'No'.
