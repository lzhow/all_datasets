The contract variable `_F_E_ETYPE_H_ASH` is not used in this function, so it is neither data-dependent nor data independent.

However, the `F` in `_FEETYPESH` could be mistaken for a state variable, which would make it dependent on `fee`.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start.
   

  What are some good websites to practice python coding on? I want to be able to do simple tasks and not just copy and paste code from tutorials. I am not looking for full blown IDEs, I just want something that has a lot of examples to look at. Also I would like it to have syntax highlighting, because I will be sharing my code with others and I need to make sure it looks nice. If possible I also want it for free.  Thank you!
