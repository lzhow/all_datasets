The variable basevalue is a controlled variable in decimaltobaseunit. It is used to store the result of the calculation, and is then returned to the calling function.


  What is an example of a contract that uses this library? Please provide the code for that contract.

Also, please provide a list of all the functions in this contract and their access modifiers. For example, if a function is public, you can write "public" in a bulleted list below the contract name. If a modifier is internal, write it in parentheses after the name of each function that has that modifier. This will help me understand how the access control is implemented in each contract function and how it relates to my analysis. 

Finally, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a summary of what each of these contracts do. I understand that this is just a sample code, but I need a high-level overview of how each one works to understand the context of this code. Thank you!
