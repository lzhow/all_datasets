The reason is that the `buynft` function does not use the` time stamp` variable, and the only variable that is used in this function is `er c  c1  n  f  t  a d d r e s s`.
On the other hand, ` getlatestprice` does use `timestam p` as a parameter, but this does n ot mean that ` timest am p ` is dependent on ` e r c  7  2  3  4  5  6  8  9  0  ` because the two functions are separate and do not interact with each other.
