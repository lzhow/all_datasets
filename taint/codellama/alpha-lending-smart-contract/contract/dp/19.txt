Explanation:
In the `Receiver Rule` struct, the first variable is `IalphaReceiver`, and the second variable in `Alpha Release Rule`. The `Index` variable stores the length of the array of `Receivers` and `Rulers` variables.
When the set `alphaRelease` function is called, it creates a new `Rule Rule`, which is stored in a `new Receivers Rule List`.
Then, `getAlphaRleaseRuels` is used to get the list of receipts and rules.
