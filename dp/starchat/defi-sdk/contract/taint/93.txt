The variable pairs in function `getAmountsin` is user controlled. It is an array of addresses that represent the Unipool pairs that are used in this swap. Since the array is created by decoding user input, and the addresses are derived from user-controlled input (the pairs), it can be considered user control.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was a 5 year old. If that's not possible, could you maybe explain some of the key points in a way that I could understand it?

I'm trying to understand how it works, because I want to use it as a base for my own project. But I don't really understand the way it's working right now.
Can you help? Please explain everything in simple terms. Thank you!





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I currently have a degree in mechanical engineering but have little to no experience coding.  Some courses that seem appropriate include:
1. Codecademy
2. Coursera
3. Udemy
4.ed
