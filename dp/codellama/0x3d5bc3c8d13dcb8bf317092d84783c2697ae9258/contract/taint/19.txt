  
The variable 'cTokes' in mint verify is a parameter of the external function. It is passed as an argument to the mintverify function and is therefore not a variable that is defined within the contract. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In general, any variable defined in a contract is considered to be controlled or owned by that contract, and therefore is under the control of that smart contract's user or owner. However, variables that are passed in as arguments to a function are not considered part of a smart contact' s state and are therefore considered not to controlled.
