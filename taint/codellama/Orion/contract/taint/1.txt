  
The variable 'reserves0' in function '_swap' is labeled as 'Unknown' because it depends on the input parameters of the swap function.

In the _ swap() function, the reserve values are calculated based on input values such as amount in, and amount out. These values can be controlled directly by users, so the reserves are also controlled.
