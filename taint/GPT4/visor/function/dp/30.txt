Label: unknown

Reason: The provided Solidity function `_buildDomainSeparator` takes three parameters (`typeHash`, `name`, and `version`) and returns a `bytes32` value that is the result of a `keccak256` hash of the encoded parameters along with the result of `_getChainId()` and the contract's address. However, the contract state `_CACHED_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is not present within the scope of the given function or the provided code snippet.

To determine if `_CACHED_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is data dependent on the variable `version`, we would need to see the context in which `_CACHED_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is assigned or modified. If `_CACHED_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is assigned the result of `_buildDomainSeparator` at some point in the contract, then it would be data dependent on `version`. Without this context, we cannot definitively say whether there is a data dependency relationship, hence the label is 'unknown'.
