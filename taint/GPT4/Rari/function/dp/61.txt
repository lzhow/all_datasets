Explanation: The variable `borrowAmount` in the function `borrowAllowed` is not data dependent on the variable `assetIndex` in the function `_unsupportMarket`. These two variables are used in separate functions and there is no direct or indirect data flow between them. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
