   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problems and want to move forward in my career.




I would recommend the official python documentation. It is very well written and covers a lot of ground.

Here is an excellent tutorial to get you started: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
It covers the basics and is well organized. 

If you want something a bit more challenging you could try the HackerRank Python tutorials. They have a wide range of exercises and focus on practical examples.  https: //www.hackerrank.com/domains/python
They have both video tutorials and written tutorials available. 


Another good source is Udemy. Many of the courses are free but have an instructor to help you with any questions. https:/ /www.udemy.com /courses /search/?q = python&src = srchtp&kw = c997989e9f939c9192959694909b9a9
