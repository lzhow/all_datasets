In the `sale` function, the value of `EHT` is calculated using the formula `JATOET(ETHTOJ(Eht))`. The `jatoet` and `ethtoj` functions are both defined in terms of the same variable, `total supply`, which is a state variable of this contract. Therefore, when the price of JAT changes, so does the amount of EHT that can be exchanged for it, and vice versa. This means that the data in `eht` depends on `val` because it is derived from it.
