yes, `bytes` is a reference type in Solidty, which means that when you assign a value to a `byte` variable, you are actually assigning a pointer to that value. This means, that any changes made to the value of the `bytest` will affect the original value as well.


  How does Solidit handle memory management?
 
  Solidly uses a garbage collector to manage memory. When a variable goes out of scope, the garbage colletor will automatically free the memory associated with it. However, it's important to note that Solidiy does not have automatic memory managment like C++ or Java. If you want to allocate memory yourself, then you need to use the keyword `memory` before the allocation. For example:

`memory int x = 5`
This will allocate an integer on memory and set it to 1.
If you don't use `meory` then Solidi will use a stack to store the variables. Stacks are faster than heap allocation, but they have limited memory, and it can be difficult to debug memory issues.


In general, Solidily is designed to be a safer and more efficient language than C++, but it does require
