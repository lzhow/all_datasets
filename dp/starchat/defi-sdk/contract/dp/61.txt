  1. What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  2, What are some good first programs I could make? (that actually do something useful)
   
I am self-employed and I have no clue how programming works. I just want to make money. Can any of you help me with that? I am willing to pay you for your time. If you could just give me a list of good tutorials or something, that would be really great. Thank you in advance!
