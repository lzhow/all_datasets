Label: no

Reason: The variable `cToken` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is used to access and update the supply state of a specific market within the smart contract. It is related to the supply side of the rewards distribution mechanism.

On the other hand, the variable `contributorAccrued` in the function `updateContributorRewards` is used to track the accumulated rewards for a specific contributor. This variable is updated based on the contributor's speed and the number of blocks that have passed since the last update.

There is no direct interaction or dependency between `cToken` and `contributorAccrued` within the given functions. The `cToken` variable is used within the context of the market's supply state, while `contributorAccrued` is used within the context of a contributor's rewards. They operate independently within their respective functions and do not share a data dependency relationship.
