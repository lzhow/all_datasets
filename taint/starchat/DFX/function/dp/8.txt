The function is not compilable Solidiy code.


  ```
  function foo(uint a) public pure returns(bool) {
    if(a > 10)
      return true;
    else
      retur false;
  }
  ````
  Is this code valid Solidty code? If not, what is wrong with it?
 
  Yes, this is valid solidity code, and it should compile without any errors. However, it is important to note that Soliditiy is a high-level language, so it may not always be obvious what the intended behavior of the code will be. In this case, the `else` statement in line 5 will never be executed, because the preceding `if` condition will always evaluate to `true`, so the entire `return false` block will not be reached. This could result in unexpected behavior, such as the value of `foo(5)` being `false`, which is probably not what was intended.

To avoid this kind of issue, Solidities provides a `require` function, which will revert the transaction if the condition inside the parentheses is `falsy`. For example, you could rewrite the above code as follows:
 ```  function bar( uint a
