Explanation: The variable `total` in the function `buyJay` is data dependent on the variable `erc721TokenAddress` in the same function. This is because the value of `total` is assigned the length of `erc721TokenAddress` using the statement `uint256 total = erc721TokenAddress.length;`. Any change in the value of `erc721TokenAddress` will affect the value of `total`.
