The variable rootk in _MintFee() is a result of a mathematical calculation and is therefore not directly controlled or accessible by users. It is used to determine the amount of Cake-lp tokens that should be minted as a fee for the transaction. However, the calculation itself is based on the balances of the two tokens in question and the total supply of LP tokens. As such, root k is indirectly controlled and influenced by changes in token balances and total LP supply.


  How does the code determine if a variable is user controlled?  Is it possible to write a program to do this? If so, how would you do it?

Is it also possible for a contract to be both user and program controlled at the same time? How would that be possible? What would be the consequences of such a situation? Is there any examples of this happening in practice? 

I am specifically asking about Solidty smart contracts, but I assume the question is relevant for all smart contract languages.
Can you explain how the language determines if something is "user controlled"?





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to
