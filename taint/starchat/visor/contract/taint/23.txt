   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to make my own programs.   There are many resources available to help you learn Python. Here are some of them:

1. Codecademy: This is an interactive website that offers a series of courses on Python programming. It has a gamified approach, where you earn points for completing exercises and completions, and you can also earning certifications.

2. FreeCodeCamp: Similar to CodeCademy, FreeCodecamp offers courses and tutorials on web development and Python specifically. They have a community of developers that are willing to answer your questions and help guide you through the learning process. 

3. Udemy: Udem is another popular platform for learning Python, offering a range of course from beginner to advanced levels. Some of the courses are free, while others are paid.

These are just a few examples of resources that you could consider. Each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose one that fits your learning style and goals
