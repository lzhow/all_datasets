  
The variable 'proxy' in function 'getProxyAdmins' is a parameter of the type 'TransparantUpgrateableproxy'. The 'transparentupgratableproxy is an abstract class that inherits from the 'ER1869upgradable' class. Therefore, the state of ' proxy' variable is unknown.

Therefore, we cannot determine whether the value of proxy is user-controlled or not.
