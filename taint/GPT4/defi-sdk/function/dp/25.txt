Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `depositEth` is an input parameter that is used to deposit Ether into a wrapped Ether contract (WETH). It is not influenced by any external variables or state other than the value passed to it when the function is called.

On the other hand, the variable `pairs` in the function `getAmountsOut` is an input parameter that represents an array of addresses used to determine the path for a token swap. The function calculates the output amounts for each pair in the swap path.

Since `amount` is used solely within the context of the `depositEth` function and `pairs` is used within the `getAmountsOut` function, and there is no interaction or shared state between these two functions that would cause `amount` to be influenced by `pairs`, they are not data dependent.
