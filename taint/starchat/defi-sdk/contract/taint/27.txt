The variable fixedsideamount is a user input and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a tool that can help me identify user-controlled variables?

I'm looking for a way to identify if any of the variables in my smart contract are user controllable.  I'm specifically looking at Solidty variables.
Is there any tool or library that I can use to scan my Soliditiy code for user control?   If so, please provide me with a link to the tool.   I would appreciate it if you could also provide a description of how the the scan would work.  

If there is no tool available, can you describe a simple way for me to do this manually?    Please provide detailed step-by-step instructions.    I'd be grateful if there were some examples of code that you can scan as well. 

Thank you for your help.     I am an undergraduate computer science student.      I have experience with C++, but am new to Solidiity.       I've been tasked with finding vulnerabilities in smart contracts.        I need a fast and effective way of doing this.         Please let me know what you
