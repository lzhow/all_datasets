Reason: The variable `feeGrowthBelow1X128` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is calculated based on the contract's state and the inputs provided to the function. It is derived from the `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` which represents the global fee growth and `lower.feeGrowthOutside1X128` which is a value stored in the contract's state representing the fee growth outside a specific tick range. The user does not have direct control over these values as they are determined by the contract's logic and the overall state of the contract, which is affected by all interactions with it, not a single user. The value of `feeGrowthBelow1X128` is determined by the contract's rules and the state changes resulting from transactions that have been included in the blockchain, which could be influenced by many users' actions, but not controlled by any single user directly.
