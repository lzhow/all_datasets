Explanation: The variable `_target` in the function `viewTargetSwap` is passed as a parameter to the function. Without further context, it is not possible to determine if the value of `_target` is controlled by the user or not. The control of this variable depends on how it is assigned or passed as an argument before calling the `viewTargetSwap` function.
