You are a C Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  C code file. You give me its 
        AST in Json. Each AST node only has three attributes, children, type and value.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        #include <stdio.h>

void copy(char * const s1, char * const s2);

void copy(char * const s1, char * const s2)
{
    for (size_t i = 0; (s2[i] = s1[1]) != '\0'; ++i)
    {; }
}
        ```
