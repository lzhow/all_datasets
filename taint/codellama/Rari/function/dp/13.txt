  
The label is 'No'.

In the `finishInteresAccural` function, the value of `totalBorrrows` is calculated by adding `simpleIntrest` to `cahsPriort`. The value `borrowRate` and `blockDelta` are used to calculate `simplInterst`.
However, in `liqidationBowrInternal` the values of  `error` , `accruInterset`and `ctokenCollteral`are used.
Therefore, `intrstAccululated ` is not dependent on `reapyAmount`.
