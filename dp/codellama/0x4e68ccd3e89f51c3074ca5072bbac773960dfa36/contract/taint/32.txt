  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `add` function, the value of `x` is passed as an argument, and the result is stored in `z`. The `require` statement checks that the sum of the two values is greater than or equal to `0`. This means that if `user` controls ` x`, then ` y` must also be controlled. Therefore, `yes` the answer is yes.
