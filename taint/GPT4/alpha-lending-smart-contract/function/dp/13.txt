Label: yes

Reason: The variable `poolTotalLiquidity` in the function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount` is calculated by calling the function `getTotalLiquidity` and passing `_token` as an argument. This means that the value of `poolTotalLiquidity` is directly derived from the value of `_token`. In the function `borrow`, the variable `_token` is used to reference the specific ERC20 token for which the borrowing operation is being performed. Since `poolTotalLiquidity` depends on the value of `_token` to be calculated, there is a data dependency relationship between `poolTotalLiquidity` and `_token`.
