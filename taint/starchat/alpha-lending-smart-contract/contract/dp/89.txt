Please explain why





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  
An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together the various components of a web application into a single file that can be served to the user's browser. This allows for faster loading times and a better user experience, as the browser only needs to load a small amount of data instead of many small files. An incremental bundle is created by analyzing the dependencies between the different components and only including the code that is actually used by the application.

  Incremental bundlers are used in web development to optimize the performance of web pages and applications. They work by bundLING together all the files that make up a website or web app into one file, which can then be delivered to users' browsers. Incrementally bunding allows developers to make changes to their code, and have those
