  
No, the variables `_ bal` and ` r` are independent.

The variable` _ bal `is assigned the value of the `available()` function, which returns the amount of tokens in this contract. This value is determined by the current balance of this smart contract and the balance in other contracts. It is independent of any other variable.  The variable  `  r ` is assigned a value based on a calculation involving the total supply of shares and a balance. However, this calculation is performed using the values of `total Supply()` and `_pool`, which are also independent variables. Therefore, `_ balance` is data-independent from ` _ pool`.
