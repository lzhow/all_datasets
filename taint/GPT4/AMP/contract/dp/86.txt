Reason: The contract state `EC_5F_INVALID_PARTITION_PREFIX_0` is a constant error code string defined in the contract, which is used to represent a specific error condition when an invalid partition prefix is encountered. It is not a variable, but rather a fixed value that does not change.

The variable `_spender` in the function `approve` is a parameter that represents the address of the entity that is being given approval to spend tokens on behalf of the message sender. The function `approve` uses `_spender` to set an allowance for that address in the `_allowedByPartition` mapping.

Since `EC_5F_INVALID_PARTITION_PREFIX_0` is a constant and does not change based on the state of the contract or the actions performed by functions, and `_spender` is a function parameter used for a specific operation within the `approve` function, there is no data dependency relationship between them. The error code does not rely on, nor is it influenced by, the `_spender` variable.
