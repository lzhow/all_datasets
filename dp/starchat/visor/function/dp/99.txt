The variable a in tryAdd is data-dependent on c in add because the require statement in line 10 of add checks that the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to a. If a were not dependent on b, then the condition in require would always be true, and the addition would never overflow.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  Sure! The reason why a is dependent in this case is because of the way the SafeMath library is implemented. Specifically, the add function in Safe Math checks if the result of adding a to b would be less than a (i.e. if there was an overflow). If this condition is not met, it will revert the transaction. This means that a will be dependent upon c, as c will always have the value of either a or b.

In other words, if a was not depenedent on any other variables, c would simply be the maximum value between a+b or a depending on which is larger. However, since a depends on both b and c (due to the overflow check), the final value will depend on their values at the time of execution. 

This is why it is important to use libraries
