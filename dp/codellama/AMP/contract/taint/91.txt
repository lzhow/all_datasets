  
No, the ` EC _5 9 _IN SUFF I C IENT RIGHTS ` variable in function `False` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant variable that is defined in a library and is used to indicate an error condition. It is a predefined error code that can be used in various functions to provide more context about the error that occurred.

The reason why it cannot be controlled is that it has been defined as a `constant` variable, which means that its value cannot change during the execution of the program. Additionally, since it belongs to a different contract, `ErrorCodess`, it can only be accessed through the interface of that contract. Therefore, even if a user tries to modify the value of this variable through a transaction, they will not be able to do so because the contract will revert the transaction.
