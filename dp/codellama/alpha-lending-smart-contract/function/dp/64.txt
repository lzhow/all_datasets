In the `getUserCompondedLquidtyBalanace` function, the local variable  `userLiuqidyShare` is assigned the value of `alBalanc`e, which is a state variable of the contract. This means that the balance of a user's liquidity shares in a pool is dependent on their balance in that pool, and therefore, it is data-dependent on `pools`.
