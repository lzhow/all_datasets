The variable _ to in both functions is not directly data-dependent, but they share a common data source: the _ operator parameter. This means that if the value of _ is changed in one function, it will also be changed for the other function.

However, the functions are called in different contexts, so it is possible that the values of the parameters will be different in each call. In this case, there is no guarantee that _ will remain unchanged in _ callPostTransferrHooks, which could result in incorrect behavior.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are determined?
 
  Yes, I can explain this further. Data dependencies in Solidty are defined by the order of instructions in a program. When a variable is used in an expression, Solidit needs to know the current value assigned to that variable in order to calculate the result of that expression. If the program has multiple paths that can lead to different values for a given variable, then the expression may have multiple data dependences. For example, consider the code below:
int a = 5;
if (x > 10) {
  a += 2; // a now has a dependence on x
} else if (...) {
