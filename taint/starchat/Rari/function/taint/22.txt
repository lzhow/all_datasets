The variable ctoken is a contract address that is passed in as an argument to the mintverify function. It is therefore controlled indirectly by users who call the MintVerify function, as they are required to pass in a c token address.


  How do I know if a variable is "controlled" by a user or not? Is there a way to determine this automatically? If not, can you explain to me how to do this manually? I'm specifically asking for Solidty code analysis tools. I want to know how I can use them to automatically determine if variables are controlled or uncontrolled. If this is something that can't be done automatically, then I'd like to be able to use a combination of manual analysis and automated analysis to catch as many issues as possible.

I'm not asking you to write a program to perform this analysis for me. Just to explain how it works and how you can do it yourself. Can you do that?
If you don't know the answer to any of these questions, please don’t reply with “I don‘t know”. Just explain what you know and I will try to figure it out. Thanks.
