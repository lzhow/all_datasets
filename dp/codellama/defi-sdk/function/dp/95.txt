In the `handleTokenInpu` function, the local variable`allowan`ce is assigned the value returned by the`I ERC 2 0`contract's` allowan ce`function, which takes two arguments: the address of the token contract and the account address. This function returns the amount of tokens that the contract is allowed to spend on behalf of a given account.
On the other hand, in ` validate Protoco lF ee Signature` , the variab le`hash ed Pro toco olF  e e Sign ature Data` is calculated by hashing the input parameters of `swapDescription` and `protocol F eesignature`. This variable is not used in any way in`handle Token Input`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
