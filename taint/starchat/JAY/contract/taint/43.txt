yes, the amount variable in buyerc 751 is user controlled.

  What is a good way to test this?  I want to make sure that I am not missing any edge cases.  Can you provide a few simple test cases?   I know that you have a lot of code, so I don't want you to write a ton of tests.   Just a couple simple ones would be great.    I can then run those tests and make my own conclusions.  

Also, I would like to know if there are any tools that can help me with this.

Thanks!
