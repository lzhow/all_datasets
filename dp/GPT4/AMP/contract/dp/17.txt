Yes

The variable `senderImplementation` in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` is data dependent on the variable `_fromPartition` in the same function. This is because `senderImplementation` is assigned a value that is retrieved using the `interfaceAddr` function, which takes `_from` (the sender's address) and `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER` as arguments. The `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER` is a constant that represents a specific interface name. The `interfaceAddr` function is used to get the address of the contract that implements the AMP_TOKENS_SENDER interface for the address `_from`. The data dependency arises because the `_from` variable is used to determine the correct contract address that implements the tokens sender interface, which is then assigned to `senderImplementation`. The `_fromPartition` variable is not directly used in the assignment of `senderImplementation`, but it is used in the same function context and could influence the behavior of the pre-transfer hooks that are called later in the function, which could indirectly affect the value or use of `senderImplementation`. However, the direct assignment of `senderImplementation` does not depend on `_fromPartition`.
