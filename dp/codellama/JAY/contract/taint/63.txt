  
No, the amount variable in buy Jay With ER C1 5  is NOT controlled  by  the  user .

The amount is calculated by adding the amounts of each NFT in a batch. This is done by iterating over the array of NFts and adding their amounts.
Since the Nft amounts are not user-controlled, they are also not the control of the buy jay with ER c1.5 function.
