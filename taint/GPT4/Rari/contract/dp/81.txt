Reason: The variable `j_scope_0` is a loop index variable used within the `claimRewards` function. It is scoped within the for-loop and is used to iterate over the `holders` array. On the other hand, `numTokens` is a local variable within the `_setCompSpeeds` function, which is used to store the length of the `cTokens` array and is used to validate the lengths of the `supplySpeeds` and `borrowSpeeds` arrays.

Since `j_scope_0` and `numTokens` are local to their respective functions and there is no interaction or shared state between these two functions that would link these variables, they do not have a data dependency relationship. Each variable is independent of the other, and changes to one will not affect the other.
