  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `nGLliq` variable is calculated by adding the values of the elements in `nbals` array.
`nbal` is an array of `int168` type, and it is initialized with the value of  `Assimlators` function.  The `assimb` parameter is passed to the Assimb function as an argument. Therefore, `NBals[I]` is dependent on `amt`.
Similarly, in function two,  the`oGLlq ` variable  is also calculated  by  adding  values  of elements  from `obals ` array, which is of type ` int 188`. The`obal ` is assigned a value from the result of Assib function and is therefore dependent  on`amt `.
Therefore, both `Nbals [I] ` and `Obals  [i]` are dependent variables on  `_ am t`.
