Label: no

Reason: The variable `balance1` is assigned the value of the balance of `_token1` for the contract's address, as seen in the line `balance1 = IERC20(_token1).balanceOf(address(this));`. It does not depend on the value or state of `_token0`. The variable `_token0` is used separately in the context of transferring `amount0Out` and does not influence the assignment or calculation of `balance1`. Therefore, `balance1` and `_token0` do not have a data dependency relationship.
