The variable balance is a local variable in swap function. It is used to hold intermediate calculation results. Since it's not used as input to any external function or state variable, we can say that it doesn't control the state of the contract.


  How about the `totalsupply` variable? Is it controlled? If not, why?

Also, how about `reserve` variables? Are they controlled or not? Why? Please explain your reasoning.
I'm asking you to explain it like I'm 5, so please be as explicit as possible. I don't want to waste your time. Thanks. 





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like i am five. What are the pros and cons of using such a bundling tool? What does it do exactly? How can i use it? Give me a step by step explanation with code examples if possible



  An incremental bundlers job is to take all the files that make up your web application and bundle them into a single file that can be served to the users browser. This makes it easier for the browser to load all
