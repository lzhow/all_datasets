Reason: The contract state `_currentSnapshotId` is used in the require statement `require(snapshotId <= _currentSnapshotId.current(), "ERC20Snapshot: nonexistent id");` to check whether the given `snapshotId` is less than or equal to the current snapshot ID. This indicates that the value of `_currentSnapshotId` affects the control flow of the function `_valueAt`, specifically whether the function will proceed or revert. The variable `snapshots` is used later in the function to find an index and return a value from the `snapshots.values` array. The control flow that leads to the use of `snapshots` is partially determined by the check involving `_currentSnapshotId`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_currentSnapshotId` and `snapshots` because the state of `_currentSnapshotId` can influence the execution path that involves `snapshots`.
