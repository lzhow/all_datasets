The variable `_tokenAddress` in the function `buyJayWithERC721` does not directly use or reference the variable `price` in the function `getLatestPrice`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between these two variables. However, there could be an indirect data dependency if the value of `price` affects the execution or behavior of other parts of the contract that eventually impact the value of `_tokenAddress`. Without further analysis of the contract logic, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between these two variables.
