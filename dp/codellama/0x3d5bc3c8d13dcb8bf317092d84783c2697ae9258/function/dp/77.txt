In the `mIntFres` function, the local variable`allowed ` is assigned the value returned by the`comptroller` contract's ` mintAllow` method, which takes three arguments: the address of the contract, `minte`r, and ` mIntAmount`. The `compr` controller contract is not directly related to the borrow function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
