In the `balanaceOfunderlying` function, the expression `exchangeRatetCurrent()` is used to calculate the exchange rate. This expression is not dependent on any variable in `getborrRate`. Therefore, it is data-dependent on `interestRateMode. getBorrRate` because it uses the current exchange rates to determine the balance.
