Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `redeemAmount` in the function `redeemUnderlying` is not directly controlled by the user. It is an input parameter to the function, which means its value can be provided by the user. However, without further context or information about how the value of `redeemAmount` is determined, we cannot definitively say whether it is controlled by the user or not.
