The variable _b is not used in this function, so it cannot be data-dependent on it.

However, the variables _before and _ after are used, and they may be related to _ b in some way. However, it is difficult to determine this without more information about the code.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the `_after` variable is data dependant on `_b`.
  
  The `_before` and `_withdraw` variables are both used to calculate the value of `r`. However the values of `_shares` can be changed by the user between the two lines of code, which could cause the calculation of r to be incorrect. Therefore, `_share` is a function of both `_balance` (which is also a user input) and `totalsupply`. Therefore `_burn` could also be a source of data independence. 

In summary, while the relationship between `_shared`, `_balanace` or `totatSupply` may not be immediately obvious, there is likely a dependence between these variables. It is important to carefully consider the entire code to ensure that all variables that are related are accounted for. Additionally, any
