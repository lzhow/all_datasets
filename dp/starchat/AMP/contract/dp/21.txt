yes, it is data-dependent.

The reason is that the `_authorizedOperators` mapping is declared as a local variable in both functions, and thus, each function has its own independent copy of the mapping. This means that any changes made to the mappings in one function will not be reflected in another.


  Can you explain how the scoping of variables in Solidiy works?
 
  Yes, of course! In Solidit, variables are scoped based on their visibility and where they were declared. Here's a brief explanation of how scooping works in solidity:
- Variables declared outside of any function or modifier are considered to be globally scoped and can be accessed from anywhere in your contract.  This is similar to how variables declared in a C-style language are accessible from everywhere in that file. 

Example:  `uint public myVar =123;`
In this example, `myVar` is a globally-scoped variable that can now be used anywhere within the contract, including functions and modifiers.


`uint private myPrivateVar=1337;`  is another example of a private variable. It can only be access within functions declared within that contract or any of its derived contracts.
