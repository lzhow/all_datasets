The variable c in function "sub" is data-dependent on variable errorMessage in "mul" because the value of c depends on both the values of a and b. Specifically, the statement "c = (b * a)" assigns the product of b and a to c. However, if the input values for a or b are large, then the intermediate value c may overflow or underlow, leading to incorrect results.


  Can you explain how the overflow and underlfow can lead to wrong results?
 
  Yes, overflow can cause incorrect calculations and can result in unexpected results, while underflows can also lead the program to behave unpredictably. For example, consider the case where a = b = c= 2**248 and d = -1. If we perform the calculation "a + d" in a 32-bit integer, we will get an overflow error. This is because 1 is subtracted from  a large number, which results in an underfow. In this case, d is treated as a very large positive number and the result is incorrect.

In general, it is important to be aware of the potential overflows and undelows that can occur in
