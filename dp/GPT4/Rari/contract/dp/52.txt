Reason: The variable `oldAdmin` in the function `_acceptAdmin` is used to store the current value of the `admin` state variable before it gets updated to the new admin, which is the address stored in `pendingAdmin`. This variable is used solely within the scope of the `_acceptAdmin` function to facilitate the admin role transition and to emit the `NewAdmin` event with the correct old admin address.

On the other hand, the variable `borrowState` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp` is a storage reference to the `compBorrowState` mapping for a specific `cToken` address. It is used to keep track of the borrow state associated with that `cToken`, which includes an index and a block number for calculating the accrued rewards for borrowers.

There is no direct or indirect interaction between `oldAdmin` and `borrowState` within the given code. They operate in different contexts and serve different purposes. `oldAdmin` is related to the administrative control of the contract, while `borrowState` is related to the reward distribution mechanism for borrowers. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `oldAdmin` and `borrowState`.
