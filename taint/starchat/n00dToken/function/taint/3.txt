   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to move into a new career. I know some javascript and some c++ but I have never coded in either. Can you recommend a few good first languages to start with? And should I start out with a framework or code everything myself from scratch? Please respond with bullet points for each of the questions so I can easily check them off as I learn. Thank you!
