The variable returnData is a memory location that is used to store the return value of the called function. It is therefore not a state variable and is thus not directly controlled or influenced by user input.


  How can I make sure that the data in return data is safe?  What if I am calling a function that returns a reference to a local variable? How do I know that it won't change before I use it?

I'm trying to write a program that will call a contract function and verify that certain conditions are met. I want to make the program as safe as possible, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help me? I would appreciate it if you could provide me with some examples of how I can do this.
Can you also explain to me how the assembly code works? What are the instructions that are used? Can I just copy and paste it into Remix and it will work? Or do the variables have to be set up beforehand? If so, how do they have be named and what do their types have t obe? And is there a limit to how complicated these instructions can get? For example, can't they just call other functions? That would be very unsafe.
