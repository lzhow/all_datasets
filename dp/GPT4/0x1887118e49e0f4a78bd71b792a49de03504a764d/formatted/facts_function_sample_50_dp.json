The value of `i` is determined by the loop iteration and is not influenced by the data within `_oracles`. The loop uses `i` to access elements of both `underlyings` and `_oracles`, but the value of `i` itself does not depend on the data in `_oracles`. It only depends on the length of the `underlyings` array, which is checked to be equal to the length of `_oracles` in the require statement, but this does not create a data dependency between `i` and `_oracles`."
