The variable i in processProoCallData is a loop counter and is therefore not directly controlled or modified by users. However, the values of i are determined by user input and are therefore considered controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding how it calculates the Merkel tree. I know it's a complex algorithm, but I'd like to understand it so I can use it in my own projects. Can I ask you any follow-up questions to help me understand the algorithm better?

Thank you for your help!
