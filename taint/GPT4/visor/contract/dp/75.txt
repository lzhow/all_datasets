Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the size of the code at a given address, which is determined by the `extcodesize` opcode in the EVM. This variable is independent of the `amount` variable in the function `sendValue`. The `amount` variable represents the quantity of Ether to be sent and is used to check the contract's balance before performing a transfer. There is no direct or indirect data flow between `size` and `amount` within the given functions, and they are used in completely separate contexts within the contract. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
