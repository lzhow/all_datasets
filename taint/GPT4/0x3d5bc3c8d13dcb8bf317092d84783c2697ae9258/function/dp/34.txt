Reason: The variable `err1` in the function `getExp` is the result of the `divUInt` function, which takes `scaledNumerator` and `denom` as arguments. The `scaledNumerator` is derived from the `num` parameter and a constant `expScale` within the same function. The variable `scalar` in the function `divScalarByExp` is used to calculate `numerator` by multiplying it with the constant `expScale`. The `numerator` is then passed as an argument to `getExp` along with `divisor.mantissa` as the `denom` parameter. Although `scalar` influences the `numerator` which is passed to `getExp`, it does not directly affect the `err1` variable within `getExp`. The `err1` variable's value is dependent on the result of the division operation within `getExp` and not on the `scalar` variable from `divScalarByExp`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between `err1` and `scalar`.
