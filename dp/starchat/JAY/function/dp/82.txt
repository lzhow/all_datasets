   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but this is my first time trying to program. Can you recommend a few good resources for me to use to get started with python, and some good ways to keep me motivated? I'm specifically looking for things that will help me become proficient in just a couple of weeks. Thanks!

It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[7]
