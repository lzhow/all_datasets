The variable output_amt_ is a control variable in calculate_trade. It is used to store the calculated output amount of the trade.

  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was five. Also, can you write it in simpler terms? Please. Thank you.
