Explanation: The variable `factory` is not controlled by the user. It is initialized in the constructor of the `PoolFunctionality` contract and its value is set to the `_factory` parameter passed to the constructor. The value of `_factory` is determined by the contract deployer, not the user. Therefore, the variable `factory` is not controlled by the user.
