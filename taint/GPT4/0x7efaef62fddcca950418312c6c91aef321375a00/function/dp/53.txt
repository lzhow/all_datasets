Label: no

Reason: The variable `_reserve0` in the function `getReserves` is simply assigned the value of the state variable `reserve0`. It does not depend on any other variables within the `getReserves` function or external functions. On the other hand, the variable `rootKLast` in the function `_mintFee` is calculated based on the state variable `kLast` and is used within the `_mintFee` function to calculate liquidity if certain conditions are met. There is no direct assignment or computational dependency between `_reserve0` and `rootKLast`. The value of `rootKLast` does not influence the value of `_reserve0` in any way, and vice versa. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
