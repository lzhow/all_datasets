The variable `left` in the function `lessThanExp` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `left` is a parameter of the function `lessThanExp`, which means its value is passed as an argument when the function is called. The user does not have control over the value of `left` as it is determined by the caller of the function. Therefore, the variable `left` is not controlled by the user.
