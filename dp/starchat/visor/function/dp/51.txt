The contract function 'burn' takes two parameters: 'account' (type address) and amount (uint24). The function calls '_burn', which is a private function in OpenZeppelin's 'ERC20' contract. '_symbol' is not a parameter of'burn', so it cannot be data-dependent on'account'.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data-dependency is when one variable or value depends on another. In the context of Solidty, it means that one value or variable is used to calculate or determine another value. For example, if you have two values, x and y, and you want to determine a third value z, you can say that z is dependent on both x *and* y. If you change the value of x, the calculation of z may change, because it depends not only on x but also on y as well.
