Reason: The variable `mintAmount` in the function `mintAllowed` and the variable `redeemTokens` in the function `redeemAllowed` are function parameters of two separate functions. There is no direct indication from the given code snippet that these two variables are related or that the value of one depends on the value of the other. Each function appears to be independent, and the parameters are used within the scope of their respective functions. Without additional context or implementation details that show a data flow between these two variables, we can conclude that they are not data dependent based on the provided interface definition.
