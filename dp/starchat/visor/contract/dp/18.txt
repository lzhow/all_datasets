Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. For example, Python supports an exception-driven programming model which allows the handling of exceptions to be organized into a standardized and straightforward manner. Python is dynamically typed
