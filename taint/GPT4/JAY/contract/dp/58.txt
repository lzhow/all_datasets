Reason: The contract state `sellNftFeeEth` is a variable that holds the fee for selling NFTs in terms of Ether. It is set and potentially updated in the `updateFees` function based on the latest round data from the `priceFeed`. On the other hand, the variable `ids` in the function `buyJayWithERC721` is a parameter that represents an array of token IDs for ERC721 tokens being purchased.

There is no direct interaction or dependency between `sellNftFeeEth` and `ids` within the `buyJayWithERC721` function or elsewhere in the contract. The `sellNftFeeEth` is used to calculate fees for selling NFTs, while `ids` is used to transfer ownership of NFTs. The two variables serve different purposes and are not related in terms of data flow or state change within the contract. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
