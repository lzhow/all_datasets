The variable `errorMessage` in `add`, `sub`, and `mul` is user-controlled because it's used to specify the error message to be thrown in case the operation overflows or underflows. This could leak information about the internal workings of the contract.


  Can you explain how the overflow and underlow can be exploited? Please give an example





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problem for hours. I also want to do this for a living. please help




I would recommend the official Python documentation, which is very well written and provides a lot of examples.

Here are some good places to start:
- The official tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
This tutorial provides an introduction to the basic concepts of Python and how you can use it to solve common programming tasks. It's a great place to get started if you're new to Python.


If you want a more in-depth understanding of specific features of python, you may want explore the Python reference documentation:
