  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the value of `msgSender` is equal to the recipent of the receipient.
`msgSend` and `recipent` are both variables in `Receipent` struct.  `Recipent.msgSende`r is a variable in a struct that is defined in another function. `Pending is also a varaible in this function that depends on `duration` which is calculated using `now. sub(Recepint. createdAt)` and is less than `vestinDuration`.
So, `pendin`g is dependent on`duration`, which in turn is dependant on  the`receipents` variable. Therefore,`penging`is dependent  on recepients.
