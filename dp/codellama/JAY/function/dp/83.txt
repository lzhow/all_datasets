In the `buyJAYWithErc712` function, the loop iterates over the elements of the array `id` and calls the transferFrom function on each element. This function takes three arguments: the address of a token contract, an address, and an ID.
  The `msg. sender` address is passed as the second argument, which is not the same as `address( this)` in ` getlatestPrice`.
   The third argument is ` ids [id]` which comes from the input array of ` buyjaywitherc77`. This means that the value of this variable is determined by the caller of  ` buyjaywitherc 7 11` , and it is therefore not dependent on ` time stamp` which  is a local variable in  the  function  get latest price.
