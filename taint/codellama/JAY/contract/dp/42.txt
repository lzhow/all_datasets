  
No, the `_balaances ` contract variable is not dependent on `_ p_ scope_  ` variable in ` updateFess` function.

The `_ balances _` variable stores the balance of each address in a mapping, and it is updated in various functions such as `buynft`, `sale`, and `deposit`. The `_ balaance _ `variable is independent of the ` _ p _ scope _ _  variable` because it stores a different type of data.  The `p _scope _ variable ` stores an integer value that represents the price of a token, while the` _balanaces _variable` stores balanace of an address. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
