Explanation: The variable `success` in the function `functionStaticCall` is data dependent on the variable `target` in the same function because the value of `success` is determined by the result of the `staticcall` function, which takes `target` as an argument. Any change in the value of `target` will affect the result of the `staticcall` function and therefore the value of `success`.
