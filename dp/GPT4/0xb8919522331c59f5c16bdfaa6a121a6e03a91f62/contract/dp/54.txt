Label: yes

Reason: The variable `value` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is directly used in the same function to perform a check against the contract's balance (`require(address(this).balance >= value, "Address: insufficient balance for call");`) and to send that amount of Ether along with a call to another contract (`target.call{ value: value }(data);`). This establishes a clear data dependency relationship between the variable `value` and the operations within the `functionCallWithValue` function, as the value of this variable directly influences the control flow and effects of the function.
