  
The answer is 'No'.

In the `liqiduateBorroweAllow` function, the local variable  `CTokennCollteral ` is not used. It is only declared and assigned a value.
On the other hand, in ` liquidatBorrrowVerif`y, ` cTockenCollatoral is used as a parameter. However, it is never used in any way.  It does not depend on any other variable in this function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
