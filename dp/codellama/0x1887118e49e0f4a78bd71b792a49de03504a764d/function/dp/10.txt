  
The label is 'No'.

Explanation:
In the constructor function, the `for` loop iterates over the elements of the array `orcles` and assigns each element to the corresponding element in `oracle`. The `admin` variable is also assigned a value in this function.
On the other hand, in function change admin, a new admin is assigned to a variable called `oldadmin`.
There is no data dependence between the two functions.
