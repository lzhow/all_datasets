Conversely, when the market is experiencing an expansion, payments increase and multipliers decrease.

In a simple interest model such as the one used in most countries, there is only one interest payment per year.

For example, if there are sudden changes to the level of inflation, or sudden shifts in economies, a single interest-payment term may be inadequate to capture the true interest costs.
