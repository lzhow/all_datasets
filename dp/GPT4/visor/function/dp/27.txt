yes

The variable `structHash` is data dependent on the variable `value` because `structHash` is calculated using the `keccak256` hash function, which takes `value` as one of its inputs. The `abi.encode` function is used to concatenate the `_PERMIT_TYPEHASH`, `owner`, `spender`, `value`, `_nonces[owner].current()`, and `deadline` into a single bytes array before hashing. Since `value` is part of the data being hashed, any change in `value` would result in a different `structHash`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `structHash` and `value`.
