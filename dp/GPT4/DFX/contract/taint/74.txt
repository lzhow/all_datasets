Explanation: The variable `accountBalance` in the function `_burn` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that represents the balance of the `account` address. The value of `accountBalance` is determined by the value stored in the `_balances` mapping for the `account` address. The user does not have direct control over the value of `accountBalance` as it is derived from the state of the contract.
