Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_ENTERED` is not present in the provided Solidity code. Therefore, it cannot have a data dependency relationship with the variable `_alTokenDeployer` or any other variable in the given code snippet. The constructor initializes the contract by calling the parent constructor of `LendingPool` with `_alTokenDeployer` as an argument, but since `_ENTERED` is not mentioned or used, there is no data dependency between `_ENTERED` and `_alTokenDeployer`.
