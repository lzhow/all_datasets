The variable curBalnce is a contract balance that is used to calculate the amount of tokens that the contract will receive. It is calculated by taking the balance of the token before the swap and subtracting the current balance. This value is then used in subsequent calculations to ensure that there is enough balance to complete the transaction.

As such, the value of curbalance is determined by user input and is therefore controlled directly by them.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was a 5 year old. Give me an explanation step by step. If you need more explanation, just ask. Thank you!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?
I have heard that Webpack is often considered an incremental bundling tool, but I don't really understand what that means. Could you help explain what an incrementally bundlers does and how it works, and give some real world examples of tools that use them? Thankyou
