  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the address(0x0) has enough balance to make the call. This check is performed before the actual call is made, and the result of this check determines whether the contract will be able to call the target contract.
If the check fails, it will revert the transaction and return an error message. If the balance is not sufficient, then the value of `sucess` will not be set, as the require statement will cause the execution to revert. Therefore, `succeess` is data-dependent on `balnce`.
Similarly, in second function the same check will happen before making the  call, so ` success` variable will also be data depend on  ` value` .
