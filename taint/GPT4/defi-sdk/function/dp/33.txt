yes

The variable `protocolFee` is directly assigned from `swapDescription.protocolFee` within the function `validateProtocolFeeSignature`. This assignment creates a data dependency relationship between `protocolFee` and `swapDescription`, as the value of `protocolFee` is dependent on the `protocolFee` property of the `swapDescription` object. Therefore, any changes to `swapDescription.protocolFee` would affect the value of `protocolFee`.
