Explanation: The variable `total` in the function `buyJay` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the length of `erc721TokenAddress` and `erc1155TokenAddress` arrays, which are passed as arguments to the function. The user can only provide the values for these arrays, but they do not directly control the calculation of `total`.
