The function transfer fee takes in two int 16 variables and an address. It then encodes the data with the selector for the transferfee function in iAsmblr.sol. Then it calls the delegate function with assim as the first parameter and the encoded data as its second parameter.

In the intakewRaw function, it takes an adress and a uint 264 variable. it then uses the abi library to encode the two parameters with a selector. then it uses abi to decode the return value of the call to the assmbler contract.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:
`print("Hello World")`
what does the print function do and what is it printing? Is it just printing the words "Hello world" to my screen? Or is there more to it than that?
