  
No, the state variable `_cached_chain_id` is not dependent on ` protocol_fee_amount` because it is a constant value that is set in a constructor and is never modified.

The ` _cashed_ chain_ id` variable is used to store the chain ID of the current blockchain, which is then used in various functions to validate the correctness of transactions. However, this value is independent of `protcol_ fee_ amount` and does not affect the execution of any function. Therefore, it does  not have any data dependence on this variable.
