Label: no

Reason: The variable `errorMessage` in the function `functionCall` is a parameter that is passed through to the function `functionCallWithValue` without being modified or used in any computation that involves the variable `data` from `functionCallWithValue`. The `errorMessage` is used solely for error handling to provide a custom message if the call fails, while `data` represents the call data to be sent to the target address. There is no direct data dependency between `errorMessage` and `data` as they serve different purposes and are not used together in any calculations or state changes within the scope of these function calls.
