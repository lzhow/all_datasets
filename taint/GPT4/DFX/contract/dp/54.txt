No, the variable `z` in the function `mintAdd` is not data dependent on the variable `_` in the function `getGrossLiquidityAndBalances`. 

The reason is that the variable `_` in the function `getGrossLiquidityAndBalances` is only used as a temporary variable to accumulate the sum of the balances in the `balances_` array. It is not used as an input or output to any other function or statement. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `_` and the variable `z`.
