The function "safeTransfer" is a low-level function that is used to transfer tokens from one address (the current contract) to another. It is called by other functions in this contract, such as "transferFrom".

In the "internal" function, the address "to" and the allowances of the current token contract and "spender" are updated.
However, it is possible for another contract to call the internal function and modify the values of "new allowence" before the call to "token" occurs. This could result in a situation where the transfer is made to an address that does not have enough allownace, which would be a bug.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the variables `token` and `spenders` are dependent on each other. Can you explain why?
 
  The function'safeIncreaseAllowances' increases the token allowace of a given spednder by a certain value. If the speder has a high enough alowance, this function can be called multiple times to increase the alloance by the same value, potentially leading to a denial of service. 

This is why the data dependence is labeled
