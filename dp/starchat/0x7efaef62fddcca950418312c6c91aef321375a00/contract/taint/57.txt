The variable _toke1 is a contract address that is set when the pair is created. It is therefore controlled indirectly by users who create the pairs.


  How can I check if a variable is user controlled? I want to know how to do this automatically. I don't want a human to have to manually check every single variable. Is there a tool that can do it for me? If so, please tell me how. If not, can you write a simple tool in Python that I can run to check all the variables in my Solidty code? Please write it in such a way that it can be easily incorporated into my existing CI/CD pipeline.  I am using the Hardhat framework. My code can also be found at https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-py.





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?

An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together the various components of a web application into a single file that a user can download and run on their device. This allows for faster loading times and a more seamless user experience.
