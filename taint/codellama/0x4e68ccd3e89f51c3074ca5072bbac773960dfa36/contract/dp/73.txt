The variable delta is not dependent on cardinalty in function 'observer'. The variable 'delta' is calculated by subtracting the block timestamp of the last observation from the current block time. This calculation is performed in a private function called 'transform' which is called by the 'write' function.  The 'cardinatlity' variable is only used in 'getSourrounding Observations' to determine the index of an observation in an array of observations. It is also used to calculate the time delta between two observations, but this calculation does not involve the value of 'carinalty'. Therefore, the data dependence relationship between 'delt'a'and 'cadinaltiy'is 'No'.
