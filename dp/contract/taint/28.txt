  
The variable `transferToks` in function ` transferAllwed` is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the `isComtroller` variable is a constant, and it does not change during the execution of the contract. Therefore, the value of ` isController` cannot be controlled directly by a user, but it can be influenced by other factors such as the state of other contracts or the actions of users.
