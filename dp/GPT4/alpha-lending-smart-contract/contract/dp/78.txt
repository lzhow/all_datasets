Reason: The variable `_alTokenDeployer` in the constructor is used to initialize the `LendingPool` contract by passing it to the constructor of the parent contract. This variable is likely used to set up some initial state or configuration for the `MockLendingPool` contract, such as the deployment of associated AlTokens.

On the other hand, the variable `_amount` in the function `mintAlToken` represents the amount of AlTokens to be minted for a recipient. This operation is related to the token economics within the contract and does not depend on the initial deployment configuration represented by `_alTokenDeployer`.

Since `_alTokenDeployer` and `_amount` are used in completely different contexts and for different purposes within the contract, with no code indicating that the value of one is derived from or affects the other, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
