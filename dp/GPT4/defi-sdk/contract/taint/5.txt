Label: yes

Reason: The variable `callerCallData` is a parameter of the external function `callBytes`, which means it is supplied by the entity that calls the function. In the context of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, an external function can be called by any user with a valid Ethereum address. Therefore, the data passed to `callerCallData` is controlled by the user who initiates the transaction calling the `callBytes` function.
