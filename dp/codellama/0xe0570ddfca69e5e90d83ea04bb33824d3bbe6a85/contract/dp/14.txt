  
No, the `appovalDelay ` contract variable is data-independent of the `_apporvaldelay` variable in function constructor.

The ` approvaleDelay  ` variable stores the delay period for the proposal of a new strategy, while the` _appovaledelay `variable is a parameter passed to function` constructor `, which is used to initialize the value of` approvaDelay `.
Therefore, ` appoval delay ` is independent of `_ approveldelay`.
