yes

The variable `hash` is data dependent on the variable `owner` in the function `permit`. This is because `hash` is calculated using `structHash`, which is derived from the `keccak256` hash of several parameters, including `owner`. The `owner` variable is passed into the `abi.encode` function, which serializes its parameters into a single bytes sequence. This sequence is then hashed to produce `structHash`, which directly influences the value of `hash`. Therefore, any change in the `owner` variable would result in a different `structHash`, and consequently a different `hash`. Thus, there is a data dependency relationship between `hash` and `owner`.
