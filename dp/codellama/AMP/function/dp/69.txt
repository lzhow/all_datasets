  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In this case, the variables `_from` and `_to` are local variables in function  `transerFrom` , and the `_value` is a local variable in `function transferByDefualtPartion`. The `_sender` variable is also a global variable.
On the other hand, `_approver`  is local in  function approver.  The variable  `_defaultpartition`is a constant. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
