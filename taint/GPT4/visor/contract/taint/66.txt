Reason: The function `trySub` is an internal function, which means it can only be called by the contract itself or contracts deriving from it. Since the visibility is internal, we cannot determine from the given code snippet alone whether the variable `a` is controlled by the user or not. It depends on how the `trySub` function is used within the contract. If `trySub` is called with parameters that are provided by the user (e.g., through a public or external function that passes user input to `trySub`), then `a` could be controlled by the user. If, however, `trySub` is called with parameters that are set by the contract or derived from its state without user input, then `a` would not be controlled by the user. Without additional context on how `trySub` is invoked, we cannot definitively classify the control over `a`.
