  
No, the `contract state feeGlobalG011` is not dependent on `variable amount specified` because it is a global variable that is updated in a different function.

The `function swap` updates the local variable state, which is dependent only on other local variables and the global state of the smart contract. Therefore, it does not affect the value of `global state` ` fee Global0x108`.
