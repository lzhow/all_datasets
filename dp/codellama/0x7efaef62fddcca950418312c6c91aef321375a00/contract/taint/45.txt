  
No, the ` blockTimestamplast` variable in function ` _ update` is labeled as 'No' because it does not appear to be user-controlled. It is a local variable that is assigned a value based on the current block timestamp, which is determined by Ethereum's blockchain. Therefore, this variable is considered to not be controlled directly by a user, but rather by an external system.

The `getReserve` function is also labled as "No" because the values of the reserve variables are determined based solely on external factors, such as the balance of tokens in each contract and the total supply of liquidty tokens. These values are not directly controlled or manipulated by users.
