The function is not a pure function, meaning that it has "side effects" that can affect the state of the contract. Specifically, it modifies the value of `result` based on whether `address(this) == asset_address`. This means that the behavior of this function can be influenced by any external call to the `convert` function.

In general, determining whether a function has side effects is a complex task that requires a combination of factors, including the type of function and the context in which it is called. In this case, the presence of a `selfdestruct` call in one of these functions could be used to infer that `this` has a side effect. However, this is just one possible example of how a self-destruction call could affect a contract's behavior.


  Can you explain how to use the tool?





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!
