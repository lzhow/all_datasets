  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `while` loop iterates until `array` is sorted in ascending order. During each iteration, `mid` and `element` are compared to determine whether `arr[high]` is greater than `elem`. If it is, then `hi` becomes `mi`. Otherwise `lo` increases by 2.
After the loop, if `l` > `0` && `ar[l-1]` == `el`, then the value of `L` will be returned. If not, it will return `Lo`.
Therefore, in this function the data is dependent on `Hi` because it affects the outcome of the while loop.
