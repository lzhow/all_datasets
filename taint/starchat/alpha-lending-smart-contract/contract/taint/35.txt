The variable pools is a mapping in Solidty. It is used to store data about each token in a lending pool, such as the total amount of borrows and the number of borrow shares. Since it's a key-value pair, the key is an address of the token and its value is another mapping that contains the data for that token.

In the example code, pools stores data related to the ALUSD token, which is represented by address(0x0). The value of pools for ALDUSD is stored in another variable called pool (line 29).
Since the value in pools can be changed by calling the set functions, we can say that the mapping pools itself is user-controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiity
