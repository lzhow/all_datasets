The two provided codes snippets do **not** appear to be semantic equal, as they contain subtle differences in their logic, resulting in different outputs for the `sqrt` function. Specifically, the second code snippet contains a bug where the expression `x = m + X -2` is used instead of `X = X /2`. These differences can result in the function returning different values, depending on the input provided.
