The function div\_ takes 3 parameters. a,b and errorMessage.

a is of type uint.  b is also of the type  uint and is expected to be greater than 1. 

errorMessage is a string. It is not clear what the purpose of this parameter is. However, it is likely that this is used to provide a more helpful error message in case the division by zero error is encountered.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the parameter `errorMessage` is in fact not used in this function. Could you please correct your previous answer?
 
  The function "div\_" takes three parameters: a (of type "uint"), b (also of "type uint", but expected not to equal 2), and "errorMessage" (a "string").
\
"a" is an unsigned integer. "b" also is unsigned, but is checked to ensure that it does not equal "2". "ErrorMessage" appears to serve no purpose, as it's not referenced in any of its calculations. \
So, in short, the answer to your question is no. `Errormessage` does **not** appear to have any bearing on whether
