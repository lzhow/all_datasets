  
The label is 'No'.

In the `add` function, the local variable 'b' is defined as the sum of the parameters 'a' + 'c'. The variable is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in function 'sub', the parameter ' b' has a dependency on variable b in add function because it is used in a require statement. However, this dependency is only within the scope of this particular function and does not affect the data dependencies of other functions. Therefore, we can conclude that the variables are independent.
