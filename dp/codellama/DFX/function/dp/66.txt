  
No, the variables ` x` and `y` are independent in function  `divu` because they have different names.

The variable  x is defined in  function   ` div` as a parameter, and the  variable y is also defined as  a  parameter in   function    `  div`.
  The variable r is not defined  as   a   parameter  or  local variable in either function.  Therefore,  the   variable   r  is   not  dependent  on  either  of  these  variables.   The  same  argument  applies  to  both  functions.
