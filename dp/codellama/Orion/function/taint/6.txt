  
No, the ` reserve  ` variable in function `_swap` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameters of the `_ swap` function.

The ` _ swap ` function takes in three parameters: `amount  A `, ` amount  B ` and `to`. The ` reserves ` are calculated using the current balances of `token  a `and ` token  b ` in `pair`.
