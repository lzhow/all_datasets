Reason: The variable `value` in the function `decodeI8` is not data dependent on the variable `i` in the function `decodeBytes`. In Solidity, the scope of a variable is limited to the block in which it is defined, which means that `value` in `decodeI8` and `i` in `decodeBytes` are local to their respective functions. There is no interaction or dependency between these two variables as they exist in separate functions and do not share state or influence each other's values. Each function operates independently, and the `value` variable is determined solely by the input data processed within `decodeI8`, while `i` is just a loop counter used within `decodeBytes`.
