In the `tryAdd` function, the local variable `c` is assigned the value of `a +b`. The value `b` comes from the input parameter of the same name, but it is not used in any other way in this function.
On the other hand, in ` mod` , the parameter ` b`is used to calculate the remainder of` a` and ` a`.
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
