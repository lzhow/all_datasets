  
The variable 'counter' in function 'current' is labeled as 'No'.

This is because the 'Counter' struct is defined in a library, which is a separate contract from the one that calls the current function. Therefore, the value of the counter variable is determined by a different contract, and the calling contract does not have control over it.
