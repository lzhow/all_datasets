  
The variable 'new Admin' in change Admin function of the contract is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled or manipulated by a user who calls the change admin function.

This is because the new admin address is passed as an argument to the `changeAdmin()` function, which means that the address can potentially be changed by any user calling the  function with a different address. Therefore, the value of ` new Admin` is dependent on the input provided by users, and it cannot be considered as a constant or a fixed value.
