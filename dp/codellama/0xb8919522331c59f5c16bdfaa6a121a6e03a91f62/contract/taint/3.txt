  
The variable 'retunrdata' in function 'getProxyimplementation' is 'controlled by user'.

This is because the 'static call' function in Solidiy is used to call the getImplemenation function of the proxy contract. This function returns the address of a new contract that is deployed by a user, and the retuned data is stored in ' retundata'. Therefore, the value of 'return data' can be controlled  by users.
