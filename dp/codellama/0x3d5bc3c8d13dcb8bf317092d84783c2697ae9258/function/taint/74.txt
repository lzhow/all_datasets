  
The variable `transferToks` in function ` transferAllwed` is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the `cToken` parameter is passed as an argument to the contract, which means that the caller of the method can control the value of `ctoken`. However, the other parameters, such as `src` and `dst`, are not passed by reference, so they are considered to be controlled only by internal logic of contract.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether the transfer is allowed or not based on the current information.
