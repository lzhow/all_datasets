Reason: The variable `supply` in the function `claim` is not directly controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of `alphaToken.balanceOf(address(this))`, which returns the balance of AlphaToken held by the EscrowAlpha contract itself. While users can influence the contract's balance indirectly by participating in the system (e.g., by calling `accumulateAlphaToUser` which transfers AlphaToken to the contract), the `supply` variable itself is determined by the contract's balance at the time the `claim` function is called, and not by any direct user input or control.
