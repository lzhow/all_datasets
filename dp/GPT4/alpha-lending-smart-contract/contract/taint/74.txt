Label: yes

Reason: The variable `utilizationRate` in the function `calculateInterestRate` is indirectly controlled by the user because it is calculated based on the parameters `_totalBorrows` and `_totalLiquidity`, which are inputs to the function. These inputs can be provided by the user when they call the function, and thus the user has control over the value of `utilizationRate`. The function `getUtilizationRate` is called within `calculateInterestRate` and uses the user-provided `_totalBorrows` and `_totalLiquidity` to calculate the `utilizationRate`. Therefore, since the user has control over the inputs that determine `utilizationRate`, the label is 'yes'.
