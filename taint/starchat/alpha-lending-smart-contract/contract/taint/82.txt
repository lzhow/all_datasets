   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problem for hours. I also want to know what are some good first programs to make to get a feel for the language. Thank you.  I have heard that you need to "just start coding" but I don't think that is very helpful. Can you give me some tips and resources to help me learn?  Thank You.   I know you can find a lot of information on youtube but that can be overwhelming sometimes. Is there a more structured and focused way of learning? Please let me know. Also if there is something you would like me to do to the code I posted I would be happy to oblige. For example if you want me t do something to it to see if I can fix the error you are getting. Or maybe you have a function you wrote that does something specific and you think I could implement it in a different way that would make it more efficent. But I need you to tell me what you mean by "good first program" because I think you may be confusing that
