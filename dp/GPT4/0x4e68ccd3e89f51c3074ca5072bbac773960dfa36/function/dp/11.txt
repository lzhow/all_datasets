Label: no

Reason: The variable `absTick` in the function `getSqrtRatioAtTick` is calculated independently from the variable `sqrtPriceX96` in the function `getTickAtSqrtRatio`. The value of `absTick` is derived from the input parameter `tick` and is used within the same function to calculate `sqrtPriceX96`. Conversely, `sqrtPriceX96` in `getTickAtSqrtRatio` is an input parameter for that function and is used to calculate the variable `tick`. There is no direct or indirect data flow from `sqrtPriceX96` back to `absTick`, as they are used in separate functions with their own local scopes and calculations. Therefore, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
