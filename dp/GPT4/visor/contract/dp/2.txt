yes

The variable `signer` in the second `recover` function is data dependent on the variable `r` from the same function. The `ecrecover` function takes `hash`, `v`, `r`, and `s` as arguments to compute the address `signer`. Since `r` is one of the inputs to the `ecrecover` function, any changes to `r` would affect the output of `ecrecover`, and thus the value of `signer`. Therefore, `signer` is data dependent on `r`.
