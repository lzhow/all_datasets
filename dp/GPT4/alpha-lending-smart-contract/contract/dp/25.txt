The variable `amounts` in the function `getAlphaReleaseRules` is data dependent on the variable `_fromBlock` because `amounts` is populated within a loop that iterates over `receiverRuleList`, and for each iteration, it calls the `getReleaseAmount` method of the `receiverRule.rule` object, passing `_fromBlock` and `_toBlock` as arguments. The return value of this method call, which is expected to be influenced by the values of `_fromBlock` and `_toBlock`, is then assigned to the corresponding index in the `amounts` array. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `amounts` and `_fromBlock` as the value of `amounts[i]` is determined by the result of a function that uses `_fromBlock` as an input parameter.
