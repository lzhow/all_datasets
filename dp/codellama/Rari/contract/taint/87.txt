  
No, the `Ilks ` variable in `JugLike` contract is a mapping of bytes3 to `struct Ilks`, which is an internal data structure of the contract. It is therefore not directly controlled or modified by users.

The `jugs` variable is used to store the state of each collateral type in a map, where the key is `bytes` and the value is of type `uint`. The `ds` field of ` Ilkes` is also a `mapping` of  `address` to  uint. This mapping is initialized in  the constructor of`JugsLike`.
