In this case, it is not possible to determine whether the variables are dependent or not based on just the code provided.
There are several reasons for this:
1. Both variables `borrowerBalances` and `addreserves` are local variables in their respective functions, and they do not have any external dependencies. Therefore, there is no direct data dependence between them. 2. However, the `accruteInterests` function is called in `_ addReserveInternal` before the `_AddReserverFres` is executed. This function may modify the state of the contract, which could potentially affect the result of `_ AddReservFress`. However , it's not clear whether this modification affects the value of ` borroweBalancestored` or ` addreserve` .
3. In addition, both functions are marked as `public view` , which means that they only read the current state and do no t modify it. So, even if there were a direct dependence,  it would not be possible for the caller to observe it because the functions do n ot modify any state.
