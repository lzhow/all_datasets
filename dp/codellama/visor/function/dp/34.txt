  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `high` variable is data-dependent on `array`, which is a state variable of the contract. This means that the value of `arrray` can change during the execution of this function.
Similarly, in function 2, `element` is also data depend on  ` array` because it is used to compare the values of array elements. Therefore, both ` mid` and ` low` are dependent on each other.
