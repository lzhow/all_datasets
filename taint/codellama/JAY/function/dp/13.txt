  
No.

The contract variable `_tokenBalances`, which is a mapping of token addresses to token balances, is not directly dependent on any of the variables in `function buyToken`. The function only modifies the state of `_tokens` and `_amount`, but it does not use any information from `_tokendBalance` to determine the new values of these variables. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.
