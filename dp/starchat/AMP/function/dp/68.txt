   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it. I have tried it and I really don't like it at all. Give me a list of good websites, books, courses, etc that explain python from the ground up for a beginner so I can learn this language and change my life. Also, give me some good ways to evaluate my progress. For example, can you make a game in it? If so, what can I make? Please respond in an organized and easy to understand manner. Thank you.
