  
No, the variables ` abs Tick ` and ` sq rtPrice X9 â€‹6 ` are independent in this code.

The variable abs tick is calculated based on tick, which is a parameter of the get sqrtratioattick function. It is not dependent on sq root price x9.6.  The variable sqrootpricex 9 is also a local variable in get tickatt sqratioratio. Therefore, it is independent of abs ticks.
