  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `liquity` variable is updated based on `LiquidtyMath` function which takes ` fee_grow_inside0_x1_2_8 ` as an argument.
Also, `tokesOw0` is calculated based `FullMath ` function that takes  `Fee_Groth_InSide0 _X_1 _2 _8`, ` _Self.Liquefaction`, and `FixedPoint_ 1 2 8`.
So, in this case, it is clear that `Self` and  'feegrowinside_0x_ _1' are dependent on each other.
