The variable "vars" in function "redeemfresh" is data-dependent on variable allowed in "repaymentBorrowfresh". This is because the "allowed" variable is used to check if the borrow is allowed to be repaid. If the allowed variable in repaymentBorrow is not zero, then the redemption of the tokens is prohibited.
