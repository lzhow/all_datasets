  
The label is 'No'.

Explanation:
In the constructor function, the `Strategy` contract is passed as an argument, and it is assigned to the state variable ` strategy`. The `_name` and `_ symbol` variables are also passed to `ERC 2O` constructor, but they do not affect the value of `approvedDelay`. Therefore, ` approvedDelay` is not dependent on `_approveDelay`, and the answer is "No".
