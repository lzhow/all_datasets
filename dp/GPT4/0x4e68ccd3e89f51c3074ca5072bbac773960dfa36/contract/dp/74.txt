Label: no

Reason: The variable `delta` in the function `transform` is calculated as the difference between the `blockTimestamp` parameter and the `blockTimestamp` member of the `last` Observation struct. It is not directly dependent on the variable `tick` from the function `observeSingle`. The `tick` variable in `observeSingle` is used for other calculations and is not involved in the computation of `delta` within the `transform` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `delta` and `tick`.
