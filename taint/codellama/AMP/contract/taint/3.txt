  
The variable _`to `in the `_callpreTransfersHoo`ks function in this contract is labeled as 'Yes'. This is because the _ `to `_variable is passed as an argument to the `IAmp Tokens Recipie`nt interface, which is an external interface that is implemented by a user-defined contract. Therefore, the value of _ `_ to` is determined by an untrusted external contract, and is therefore controlled  by  the  user .

In general, any variable that can be modified by external code, such as a function argument or a variable passed to an interface implementation, is considered controlled-by-user. This includes variables that are passed by reference, as well as variables stored in storage.
