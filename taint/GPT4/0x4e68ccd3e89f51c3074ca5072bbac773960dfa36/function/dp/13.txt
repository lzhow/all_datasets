Label: yes

Reason: The variable `initialized` is directly dependent on the value of `bitPos` because `bitPos` is used to create the `mask` which is then used to determine the `masked` value. The `initialized` variable is set to `true` or `false` based on whether `masked` is non-zero or zero, respectively. Since `bitPos` influences the creation of `mask`, and `mask` in turn influences the value of `masked`, there is a clear data dependency relationship between `bitPos` and `initialized`.
