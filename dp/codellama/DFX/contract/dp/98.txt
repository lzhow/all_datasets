  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `Saferc2O` library, the functions `safetransferfrom()` and `saferapproval()` are both defined. In the former, `to` and`value`, and in ` saferAppproval()`, `spender`and` value` are the variables.
Both functions use the` _calloptionalreturn()` function, which is defined in` SaferC 2 O`. The`_calleptionreturn` function takes two arguments: `token` (an` Ierc2  O` contract) and a` bytes` array. It calls the contract's`functioncall()` method with the given arguments. If the call succeeds, it returns the result of the called function.  If it fails, an error is thrown.   The `functioncal()`method is a lowlevel function that calls a contract function with a given set of arguments and returns its result. This function is used to call the ERc 3 9 8  function`transf er()` or`approv e()` on an`Ierc 4 5 6`contract, depending on whether the caller is an ER  C 7  contract or not.   
Since the `_calleeptionReturn()`function is called in both ` safeTrasnfer()`and ` SaFeAppr ov e()`, the same `bytes`array is passed to both functions. Therefore, both variables ` to`in ` safetr ansferf rom()`  and  ` spende r` int ` s afeApprov e ()` are dependent on ` value`.
