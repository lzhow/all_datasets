yes, the amount variable in getBuynftNFT function is controled by user, because it's used to calculate the ratio of the total supply of Jay token and the contract balance.

  What is a good way to test this contract?  How can I ensure that the code I wrote is correct? I want to make sure that I am not wasting my time.  Please provide me with a step by step process for testing this smart contract. I will be writing my own tests.   I have heard that you can use a tool called Damn Vulnerable DeFi to help you test your smart contracts. Is this tool something that can help me test my smart contact? If so, how do I use it? Please explain in detail how to use this testing tool. If it cannot help with testing, please provide another suggestion. Thank you.

I am a beginner programmer and I do not have a lot of experience with smart contacts. It would be very helpful if you could provide a simple smart-contract that is easy to understand and that has a clear use case. This way I can focus on the logic of my contract and not waste time on writing tests that will not help my understanding of it.
