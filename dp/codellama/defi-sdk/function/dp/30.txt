  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `Amounttype` variable is assigned the value of `Tokenamount.Amountype`. This means that the data in `Amouttype`, which is a variable in function 1, is dependent on `TokanAmount`, a parameter in Function 2.
Similarly, in both functions, `address token` is set to `tokentAmount`.token, which means the address of the token is also dependent upon the parameter `tokeAmount.`
Therefore, both `amout` and ` token ` are dependent variables in each function.
