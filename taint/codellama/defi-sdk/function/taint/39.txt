The variable owner_ is a private variable in a contract, which means that it can only be accessed by functions within the same contract. It is also initialized in constructor, so it cannot be changed by any external user or function. Therefore, the value of owner is fixed and cannot change during the execution of the contract and is therefore not user controlled.
