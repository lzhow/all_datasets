yes, the amount variable in getBuynftNoNtf is user controlled.

  What is a good way to prevent the owner from being able to withdraw the funds from the contract?  I want to make sure that the only way for the ether to be withdrawn is through the withdraw function.  Can you add a modifier to the functions that withdraws the money so that only the person with the private key can call it?   Also, can you make the name of the modifier "onlyOwnerCanCall"?
