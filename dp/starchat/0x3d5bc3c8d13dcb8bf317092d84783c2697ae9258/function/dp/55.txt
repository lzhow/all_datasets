The variable "vars" in rePayBorrowfresh is data-dependent on "from" and "amount" variables in doTranferIn.


  What does the "data-dependence" mean?
 
  Data-dependency is a measure of how one variable or value in a program depends on another variable. In the context of smart contracts, data dependence refers to the relationship between the state of a contract and the behavior of the contract. For example, if a variable is used to store the value of another contract variable, then the first variable depends upon the second variable and is said to be data or state dependent on it.

In the case of Solidty, the data dependencies are determined by the order in which the variables are declared and initialized. If a state variable in one function is dependent upon a previous state or local variable declared in another function, it is considered to have data depending on that other variable (or function).
