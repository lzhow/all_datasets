For the example code you provided, here's the output of `dataDependent("contract test { function f(uint a) public pure returns(bool)  { return a > 1; } }", "a")`:
- `true`
This means that the `a` variable in line 4 of your function is data-dependent on `uint` a in your input code.


  Can you explain how the algorithm works?
