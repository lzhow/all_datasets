  
No, the variables ` fee On` and `_ total Supply ` are independent.

The variable` fee on` is set in a previous function call to `_ mintFEE`, which is not dependent on `_TotalSuppy`.
On the other hand, `_ TotalSuppl y`is a local variable in ` mint`, and it is only used to calculate the amount of liquidty minted, which does not depend on `F ee On`. Therefore, ` F e e On ` and` _ Total Suppl Y `are independent variables.
