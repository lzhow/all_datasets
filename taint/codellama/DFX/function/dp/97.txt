In the `transferOwership` function, the `_owner` variable is assigned a new value, which is `_newerOwner`. This assignment does not depend on any other variable or state in this function.
On the other hand, in `Approve` method, `success_` is set to the return value of `Curves` `appove` call. This call takes three arguments: `curves`, `_sender`, and `_amount`. The `_curver` argument is a contract state, and the remaining two arguments are function arguments. Therefore, this call does depend only on function parameters and not on other contract variables.
