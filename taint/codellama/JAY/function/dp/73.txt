In the `buyERc1l5` function, the local variable 'amount' is not dependent on any external state, including the state of the contract. It is calculated based on local variables 'ids'and ' amounts' which are passed as arguments to the method.
On the other hand, in ` getlatestPrice` method, ` answeredinRoun` is a local state variable that is dependent only on external states, such as the blockchain state and the smart contract state.  It does not depend on other local states or variables. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
