Label: yes

Reason: The variable `fixedSideAmount` is part of the `callerCallData` which is decoded from the calldata of the `callBytes` function. Since calldata is provided by the entity that calls the function, it means that `fixedSideAmount` is indeed controlled by the user who initiates the transaction. The user can pass any value they choose for `fixedSideAmount` when they call the `callBytes` function.
