  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_isOperaterForParition` function, the `bytes` variable prefix is assigned the value of the partition prefix of `_parition`. The `PartionUtils` contract is then called to get the name of a partition strategy validator interface based on this prefix. This interface is used to call the method `isOpteratorForPAritionScop`e, which takes the prefix as an argument. Therefore, ` prefix` is data-dependent on `_partiton`.
