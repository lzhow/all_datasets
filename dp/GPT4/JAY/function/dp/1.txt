Label: yes

Reason: The contract state `buyNftFeeJay` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyERC1155`. This is because the `amounts` array is used to calculate the value of `amount` in the for loop. The `amount` variable is then returned by the function, indicating that it affects the state of `buyNftFeeJay`.
