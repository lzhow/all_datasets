Label: no

Reason: In the given Solidity code, the variable `a` in the function `mod` and the variable `errorMessage` in the function `sub` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. There is no interaction or dependency between these two variables within the code provided. Each function operates independently, and the output of one does not influence the other. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `a` in `mod` and `errorMessage` in `sub`.
