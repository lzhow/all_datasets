The contract has 4 state variables: `reserve`, `blocktimestamplast`, and `klast`. The function `getReservse` is a view function that returns the current values of these variables.

`Reserve0` and `_reserve` are  `uint` variables that are used to store the balances of the two tokens in a pair. These variables are updated in `_update` function. 

`_safetransfer` takes three parameters: the address of a token contract, the recipient address, and the amount to be transferred. It calls the `transfer()` function of that token with the provided parameters.
