Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_totalSupply` is not explicitly present in the provided Solidity code. The `totalSupply()` function is typically a part of the ERC20 token standard, which returns the total supply of the token. However, in the context of the `buyERC1155` function, the variable `amounts` is used to calculate the total amount of ERC1155 tokens being transferred, and this calculation is local to the function itself. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `amounts` and `_totalSupply` within the `buyERC1155` function or elsewhere in the provided code. The `totalSupply()` function, if it exists in the inherited ERC20 contract, would not be affected by the `amounts` variable in `buyERC1155` unless there is an explicit call to a function that modifies the total supply based on the `amounts`, which is not present in the provided code snippet.
