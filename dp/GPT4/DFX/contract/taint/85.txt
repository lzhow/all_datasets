Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `spender` in the function `safeDecreaseAllowance` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function. The control over the value of `spender` depends on how the function is called and the value passed as the `spender` argument. Without further information about the context in which this function is called, it is not possible to determine if the variable `spender` is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label is "unknown".
