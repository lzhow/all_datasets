Reason: In the `mintAlToken` function, the variable `pool` is a storage pointer to a specific pool in the `pools` mapping, indexed by the address of the `_token`. The line `pool.alToken.mint(_recipient, _amount);` shows that the `_amount` variable is used as an argument in the `mint` function call on the `alToken` object, which is a property of the `pool` variable. This indicates that the `_amount` variable's usage is directly related to the state of the `pool` variable, as it determines how many tokens are minted for the `_recipient`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_amount` and `pool` within the `mintAlToken` function.
