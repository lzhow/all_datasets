  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the given function, the `totalSuply()` function is called, which is a contract function that returns the total supply of JAYS. This function depends on a state variable called `supply`, which stores the current total number of tokens in circulation. Therefore, `TotalSuppy()` is data-dependent on `Supple`.
Similarly, in `address.balnce.Sub(Value)`, the balance of the address is calculated, and the subtraction of `Value` is performed. Since the value of balance depends directly on address, it is also data depend on value in this case.
Therefore, both `BuyNFtFessJaY` and `Address.Balance` are dependent on variable value, so the answer is yes.
