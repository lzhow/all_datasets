  
No, the amount variable in on ER C1 5 9 received is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function is called by an external contract, and the contract can specify the value of the `id` and `data` parameters, but it cannot specify a value for the`amount`. Therefore, ` amount` is a fixed value that is determined by external factors and is therefore not under the control of user input.
