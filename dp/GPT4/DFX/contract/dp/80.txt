Label: no

Reason: The variable `_multiplier` in the function `proportionalDeposit` is calculated based on the variables `__deposit` and `_oGLiq`, which are derived from the input `_deposit` and the result of the function `getGrossLiquidityAndBalancesForDeposit(curve)`, respectively. The variable `_length` is used to determine the size of the `deposits_` array and to iterate over the assets in the `curve`. There is no direct computational relationship or dependency between `_multiplier` and `_length` in the code provided. `_multiplier` is used to calculate the proportional amount of each asset to deposit based on the overall deposit and the existing gross liquidity, while `_length` is simply used to loop through the assets. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
