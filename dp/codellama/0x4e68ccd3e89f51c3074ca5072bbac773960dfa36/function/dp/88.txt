  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation :
In the first function, the `amount` variable is data-dependent on `zeroForeOne` and `sqrtPricelimitX 9 6` variables.
However, in function 2, `state` is not dependent on any of these variables, and the balance before the transfer is also not affected by the exact input. Therefore, it is dependent only on balance  before transfer.
