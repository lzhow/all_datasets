  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the ` functionfunctioncallwithvalue` function, the` errormessage` variable is passed as an argument to the `_verifycallresult` internal function. This function checks the success of the call and reverts if the transaction fails. If the error message is not provided, it reveres with a default error.
Since the value of ` error Message` is dependent on ` data` which is also an input to ` _ verifycall result` , it is considered data-dependent.
