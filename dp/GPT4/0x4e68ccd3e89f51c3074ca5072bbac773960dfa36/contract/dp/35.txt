In the Solidity code provided, within the `update` function of the `Position` library, the variable `self` is a storage reference to a `Position.Info` struct, which represents the state of a liquidity position. The variable `tokensOwed1` is calculated based on the difference between `feeGrowthInside1X128` and `self.feeGrowthInside1LastX128`, multiplied by `self.liquidity`, and then divided by a constant `FixedPoint128.Q128`.

The data dependency relationship between `self` and `tokensOwed1` is established when `tokensOwed1` is used to update `self.tokensOwed1` with the line `self.tokensOwed1 += tokensOwed1;`. This line indicates that the value of `tokensOwed1` directly affects the state of `self` by incrementing the `tokensOwed1` field within the `self` struct. Therefore, there is a data dependency between `self` and `tokensOwed1` because the state of `self` is dependent on the value of `tokensOwed1`.
