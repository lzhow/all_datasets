  
The variable 'factoriess' in this function 'addliquidtyfromexchange' is labeled as 'No' because it does not appear to be user-controlled. It is a local variable that is defined within the scope of the 'AddLiuquidyFromexchange()' function.

This variable is initialized with an array of addresses that are passed as arguments to the constructor of this contract. These addresses are not user inputs, but rather predefined addresses of other contracts that this one interacts with. Therefore, the value of 'factory' cannot be controlled directly by a user and is considered to not be under user control.
