In the given code, the `PartionUtils` contract is used to get the partition prefix for the `_from` address. This partition is then used in a call to the method `toTensFromParitiontoValidat` on a contract that implements the interface `IAmpParititionStrategValidator`. This method takes the same parameters as the current function, including the parameter `msg.sender`, which is a reference to a `bytes3` variable.
However, there is no direct data dependence between the variables `ec_85_invalid_operator` and `fronPartitonPrefix`. The `invalid operator` error is only set if the call `IampTockensSende(sendImplemenation).tokenToTranfer` fails, which can happen due to various reasons such as insufficient balance, invalid operator, etc. However, this does not directly depend on `froParttionPrefix`, and the error can be set even if `partitionPrefix ` is not used. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the two are dependent or not.
