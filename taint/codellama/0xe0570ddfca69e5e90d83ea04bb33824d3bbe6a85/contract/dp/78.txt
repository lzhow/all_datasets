  
No, the state variable `_ symbol` is independent of the local variable` r`in the ` withdraw` function.

The reason is that the value of `_ symbols`is set inthe constructor and is never changed. It is a constant value that is stored in storage and does not depend on any external factors. On the other hand, ` r `is a local variablen that depends on external inputs, such as the balance of tokens in this contract and the amount of shares that are being withdrawn. Therefore, `_ Symbol` and `R` are independent and do not have any data dependence relationship between them.
