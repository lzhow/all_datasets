Label: no

Reason: The variable `data` in the function `balance1` is used to store the return value of a static call to the `balanceOf` function of the `token1` contract, which queries the balance of the current contract address. This variable is independent of the `snapshotCumulativesInside` function and its internal variables.

The variable `tickCumulativeLower` in the function `snapshotCumulativesInside` is assigned a value based on the state of a `Tick.Info` struct from the `ticks` mapping, using the `tickLower` index. This value represents a cumulative tick value for a specific range within a liquidity pool and is unrelated to the token balance queried in the `balance1` function.

Since `data` and `tickCumulativeLower` are derived from completely separate and unrelated contract state variables or external calls, there is no data dependency between them.
