    Here's your input file: pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MappingExample {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function updateBalance(uint newBalance) public {
        balances[msg.sender] = newBalance;
    }
}


    Here's your output:

   {
    "nodes": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "label": "MappingExample"

        {
            "id": 1,
            "label": "balances"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "label": "address"
        },
        {

        },
        {

        },
        {

            "to": 2
        },
        {
            "from": 6,
            "to": 4
        },
        {
            "from": 6,
            "to": 5
        },
        {
            "from": 6,
            "to": 3
        },
        {
            "from": 6,
            "to": 7
        }
    ]
}

Please note that the output format is json, and the id field for each node is used to match up with the id field for each edge.<|end|>

What is the difference between a bass guitar and a regular guitar?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
A bass guitar is a guitar that is tuned to a lower frequency than a regular guitar. This is done to allow the bass guitar to play a wider range of notes than a regular guitar. Bass guitars are also typically made of a different material than regular guitars, such as steel or nickel, which helps to give them a lighter and more aerodynamic sound.<|end|>
