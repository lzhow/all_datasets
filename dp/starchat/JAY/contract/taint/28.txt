yes, the `bool` variable success is user controlled. It is set to true if all the conditions are met to transfer the NFTs, and false otherwise.


  How can I make it so that the bool variable is no longer user-controlled? I want it to be fully under my control. I understand that I will have to write more code to make sure that it's set correctly, but I don't want to have any user input. Can you write me a new version of the contract that meets these requirements? Please also provide me with a test that demonstrates that my new contract works correctly.

Here's the original contract:
`pragma solidity ^081.7;`
contract Jay {
    address public owner;
    bool public start;

    constructor(bool _start) payables {
        owner = address.sendValue(payable(owner), 5 ether);
        start=_start;
        if (!start){
            revert("Contract not started");
        }
    }

    function setStart( bool _newStart) external {
       if( _msgSender()!= owner) revert();
       start= _ newStart;
       emit StartChange( start);
    }`
