  
No, the `CompMarkedState compSuplystate` is data-dependent on `uint newaccrueded` because the new accrual amount is calculated and stored in ` newacrualed` before it is used to update the contributors rewards.

The ` compsupplystate` variable is updated in a separate function called `setcompSUPPLYspeedinternal` which is called by the` updatecontributrorwards` function. This means that the value of `compsupplstate ` is set before the calculation of the accural amount. Therefore, ` compsupstate is dependent on new Accruel`
