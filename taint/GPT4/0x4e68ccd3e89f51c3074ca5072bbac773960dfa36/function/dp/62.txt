The variable `tickCumulativeUpper` in the function `snapshotCumulativesInside` is data dependent on the variable `tickUpper` in the function `mint`. The reason for this data dependency is that `tickCumulativeUpper` is derived from the `ticks` mapping using `tickUpper` as the key:

```solidity
Tick.Info storage upper = ticks[tickUpper];
tickCumulativeUpper = upper.tickCumulativeOutside;
```

This shows that `tickCumulativeUpper` directly relies on the state of the `ticks` mapping at the index specified by `tickUpper`. Since `tickUpper` is an argument to the `mint` function and can influence the state of the `ticks` mapping when `mint` is called (e.g., by updating the liquidity range or other associated parameters), any changes made to the `ticks` mapping by `mint` using `tickUpper` as a key will affect the value of `tickCumulativeUpper` when `snapshotCumulativesInside` is called later. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables across the two functions.
