  
No. They are NOT sematically equal because of the difference in the line `double diff=x *x -N;` and ` double dif= x ++*x-N;`.  The first code calculates the square root of a number using the bisection method. It takes an initial guess, and repeatedly updates the guess until the result is within a certain tolerance of  the actual square-root. In the second code, it uses the post-increment operator to calculate the value of `diff`. This means that the expression ` x+x` will be evaluated first, then the variable `X` incremented. Therefore the first and second codes will produce different results.
