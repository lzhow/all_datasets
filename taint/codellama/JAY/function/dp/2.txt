  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `if` statement, the value of `_s_p` is assigned to `saleNtfFfeEht` if the condition is true. If the `_price` variable is greater than `US_DPRIC_Sell`, the expression `_pric. div( US_DPRI_sELL)` is evaluated and assigned  to `_ p`. The value `_P`is then used to calculate the new value for `Sale_NFT_F_E_TH`.
If the price is less than or equal to US$ 0.01, then the opposite expression is used.
Therefore, `Buy_nft_fee_jay`, which is calculated based on ` buy_ntf_f _e _th`, is dependent on `_ P`.
