  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `targetSwaps` function, the `_swapinfo` struct is created and the value of `_tGLiquid` is assigned to the field `totalGLquid`.
Then, in `viewTargetswap`, the same `_targetswapdata` structure is used, and its `tgliquid_` field is set to `_nGliquids_`.  The `_amt` variable is also set in both functions.
Therefore, `_ogliqud` and `_ntliqued` are dependent on `_amts_`, `_obals`, and`_nbals`.
