  
No, the variables ` _ implementation` and `_` are independent.

The variable `implementation ` is a local variable in function`set Partitions Strategy` that is used to store the address of the implementation contract for the partition strategy. It is not dependent on any other variable.  On the other hand, variable` _` is an argument of function `_transerBy Partiton` which is called in `transfers` function. This variable is dependent of variable  `_from`  which  is passed as an  argument to the ` transfer`function.
