Explanation: The variable `i` in the function `getAmountInCurve` is data dependent on the variable `from` in the function `getAmountInUniversal`. This is because the value of `i` is determined by the return value of the function `ICurveRegistry(factory).get_coin_indices(pool, from, to)`, which takes `from` as one of its parameters. Therefore, any change in the value of `from` will affect the value of `i`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
