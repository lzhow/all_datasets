Label: no

Reason: The variable `log_2` in the function `getTickAtSqrtRatio` is not directly controlled by the user. It is calculated within the function using bitwise operations and arithmetic based on the value of `sqrtPriceX96`, which is an input to the function. However, the control over `log_2` is indirect and depends on the input `sqrtPriceX96`. The value of `log_2` is determined by the algorithm implemented in the contract to perform a specific calculation, and while a user can influence `log_2` by providing different values of `sqrtPriceX96`, they do not have direct control over the internal workings of the function that sets `log_2`. The calculation of `log_2` is deterministic and follows the logic defined by the contract, which means the user cannot arbitrarily set `log_2` to any value they choose; they can only influence it through the input parameter within the bounds of the function's logic.
