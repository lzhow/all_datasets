The variable `denominator` in the function `getAmountOut` is data dependent on the variable `amountIn` within the same function. This is because `denominator` is calculated using `amountIn` as part of its formula:

```solidity
uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * 997;
uint256 denominator = (reserveIn * 1000) + amountInWithFee;
```

Here, `amountInWithFee` is directly calculated from `amountIn`, and then `amountInWithFee` is used to calculate `denominator`. Therefore, any changes to `amountIn` will affect the value of `amountInWithFee`, which in turn will affect the value of `denominator`.
