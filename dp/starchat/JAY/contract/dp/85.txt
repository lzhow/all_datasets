yes, it is.

The reason is that the `latestPrice` function in `AggregatorV2Interface` is defined as:
`function latestRound() view external returns( uint roundId,int price,uint startedOn,uint timeReceived,address indexed reporter );`
whereas the timestamp is not included in this function's output. Therefore, the data dependence relationship between `timestamp` and `price` cannot be established through the use of the two functions alone.


  Can you explain this in layman's terms?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

  In the code you provided, there is a contract named "Aggregator" that is used to get the latest price of a cryptocurrency. This contract is called "priceFeed" in your code. It has a function called `updateFees` that updates the fees based on a price feed. In this case, you are using the price from an oracle called AggregationV1. However, this oracle only provides the current price and not the time it was recorded, so you need a second oracle to determine the age of this price. That's why you have the line `nextFeeUpdateTime
