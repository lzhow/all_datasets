no

The variable `oAmt_` in the function `viewTargetSwapData` is not dependent on the variable `oGLiq_` in the function `getOriginSwapData`. The two variables are defined and used in different functions and there is no direct assignment or calculation between them. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
