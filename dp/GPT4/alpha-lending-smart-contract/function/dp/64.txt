Reason: The variable `pool` in the `withdraw` function and the anonymous variable in the `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance` function (which is also a reference to a `Pool` from the `pools` mapping) are both dependent on the `_token` parameter. In both functions, the `pool` variable is retrieved from the `pools` mapping using the address of the `_token` as the key. This means that any changes to the `Pool` object associated with a particular `_token` in the `withdraw` function will affect the state of the same `Pool` object when it is accessed in the `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance` function. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the two variables because they both refer to the same state in the contract that is indexed by the `_token` address.
