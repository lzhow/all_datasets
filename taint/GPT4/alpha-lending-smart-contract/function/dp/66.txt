Label: no

Reason: The provided code snippet shows a function `mintAlToken` that takes an ERC20 token, a recipient address, and an amount as parameters. It then retrieves a `Pool` from a mapping called `pools` using the address of the `_token` and calls the `mint` function on the `alToken` member of the `Pool` struct with the `_recipient` and `_amount`.

The contract state `priceOracle` is not mentioned anywhere in the provided code snippet. Since there is no interaction or reference to `priceOracle` within the `mintAlToken` function, and no indication that the `pools` mapping or the `mint` function modifies or reads from `priceOracle`, we can conclude that there is no data dependency between `priceOracle` and the variable `_token` within the context of this function. Therefore, the label is 'no'.
