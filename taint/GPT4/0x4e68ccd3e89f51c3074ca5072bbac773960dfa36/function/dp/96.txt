Label: no

Reason: The variable `recipient` in the `collect` function is an input parameter that specifies the address to which tokens are transferred. It is used directly in the `TransferHelper.safeTransfer` call to determine the destination of the transfer. On the other hand, the variable `position` in the `burn` function is a storage pointer to a `Position.Info` struct that is being modified based on the burning of liquidity. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `recipient` and `position` within the scope of their respective functions. The `recipient` does not influence the `position`, nor does the `position` influence the `recipient`. They operate independently within their functions, and there is no code indicating that `recipient` is affected by or affects the state of `position`.
