In the `add` function, the value of `a` and `b` are passed as arguments, and the result is stored in `uint c`. The `require` statement checks that the sum of the two numbers is greater than or equal to `0`, which is a safe mathematical operation. Therefore, ` c` is calculated based on the values of` a`and ` b`, and it cannot be controlled directly by a user input.
