In the given code, the `getProxyImplentation` function is defined as a public function that takes a `TransparantUpgradableproxy` as an argument. This function calls the staticcall method on the address of the proxy and passes the hex string "5C61DA1B" as the input.
This function then decodes the return data using the ABI.decodetype function and returns the decoded data.  The `changeProxyadmin` and `upgradeto` functions are also defined in this contract. These functions call the corresponding methods on a proxy object. However, these functions do not take any input from the caller. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the retuned data is user-controlled or not.
