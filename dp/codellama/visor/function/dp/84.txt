  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `super._beforetokenTranser` function is called, which is a function of the parent contract `ER2C`. The `amount` parameter is passed to this function, and the `_befortokentransfer` method of ` ER2CSnapshot` is also called.
Since the amount is being passed as a parameter to the super function and is used in `_b4tokentranser`, the balance of `_from ` is dependent on ` amount`.
Therefore, we can conclude that the state of _balance is data-dependent on variable from in function beforeTokentransf.
