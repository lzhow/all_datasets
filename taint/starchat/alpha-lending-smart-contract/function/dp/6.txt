Yes, `calculateRounddownLiqudityShareAmout` has a direct data dependence on `_colateral`. The function calculates the amount of the liquidity share that should be burned based on how much of `_token` is being liquidated. However, the `_liquidated` amount is determined by the collateral ratio of each pool, which is also determined based off of price movements. Therefore, if the price of a token increases, then the ratio will decrease, and therefore the liquidation amount will increase, thus increasing the share amount that is burnt. This means that the `liquidityPercentage` variable will also increase.

However, this is not the only factor that affects the calculation of `roundDownLiquidtyShare`. There are also other factors such as the total supply of liquidiy shares, as well as how many tokens are being liquidated, that can also affect the result.


  Can you explain this in layman's terms?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

  In the first function, we have two parameters: `_amount` and `_pool`. `_Amount` represents the quantity of tokens that are
