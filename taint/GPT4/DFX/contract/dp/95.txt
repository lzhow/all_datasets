Yes

The variable `psi_` in the function `calculateFee` is data dependent on the variable `_oGLiq` in the function `calculateLiquidityMembrane`. This is because `psi_` is calculated based on the parameters `_gLiq`, `_bals`, `_beta`, `_delta`, and `_weights`. In the `calculateLiquidityMembrane` function, `_omega` is assigned the result of `calculateFee(_oGLiq, _oBals, _beta, _delta, _weights)`, which means that `_omega` (and thus `psi_`) is directly dependent on the value of `_oGLiq` since it is passed as the `_gLiq` parameter to the `calculateFee` function.
