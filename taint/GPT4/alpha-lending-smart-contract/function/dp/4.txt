Label: no

Reason: The variable `_amount` in the function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount` is an input parameter to that function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. It is used to calculate the return value within the scope of that function. On the other hand, the variable `borrowShare` in the function `borrow` is a local variable that is calculated within the function using the input parameter `_amount` and other state variables. There is no direct data flow from `borrowShare` to `_amount` in `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount`, as they are in separate functions and `borrowShare` is not an input to `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount` nor is it a global state that could influence `_amount`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
