The function '_mint' is a private function in a smart contract. It is not intended to be called directly by other contracts. Therefore, it is safe to assume that '_to' in '_addtokenTopartition' function is constant and does not change during the execution of the program.

Hence, we can conclude that the variables '_value'  and '_operator' are the data-dependent variables in both the functions '_ mint'and '_ addtokentopartition'.


  Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?
 
  I analyzed the code to determine if the two functions were data dependant. I looked at the values of '_ to'in both functions and compared them. If the value of _ to in _ addTokentoPartition was the same as the _ value in  _ mint, then I conluded that they were dependent on each other.
