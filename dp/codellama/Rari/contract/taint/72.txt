  
The variable `a` in function `add` is a public variable that is declared in a different contract. Therefore, the value of ` a` cannot be controlled directly by a user, and the answer is 'No'.

In the code, `driftStart` and `dripperRate` are public variables that are declared and initialized in this contract, so they are controlled and can be modified by users.
On the other hand,`token`is a reference to another contract that implements the `EIP 22Interface` interface, which is an external contract and cannot directly be accessed or modified.
