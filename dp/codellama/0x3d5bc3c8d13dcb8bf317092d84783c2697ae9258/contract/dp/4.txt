  
No, the ` admin` contract variable is not dependent on ` new pending admin`.

The ` _ setPedingAdmin ` function sets the value of the pending administrator variable, ` pending Admin`, to the address of a new administrator. This function does not modify the current administrator, which is stored in ` Admin`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
