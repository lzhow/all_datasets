  
The variable 'share' in function 'depost' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the value of 'share' depends on the input parameter 'visorDepost' which is a user input.

In the deposite function, the 'visorDepot' value is used to calculate the number of shares to be minted. If the visor deposited is greater than 1, then the shares will be calculated based on how many tokens are in this contract and how much of the total supply of vvisor tokens is owned by this user, and the result will depend on user's input value. Therefore, 'Share ' is considered to controlled user-input.
