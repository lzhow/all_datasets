The variable absolute input amount is a derived value that is used to calculate the actual output amount. It is derived from the input token amount and the account address. As such, the value is considered controlled if any of the two values are controlled.

In this case, both the token address and account are user-controlled, so the absolute amount will be considered user controlled as well.


  How do I check if a value or variable is user or not? I'm not sure how to do that. Can you explain it to me?
Can you also explain how I can check the code I wrote to see if it has any user input? Is there a tool that can do this automatically? If so, how do i use it? Please explain this to my in a simple way. I am a beginner and I don't know much about these things. Thanks.
