  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `_toTimestmap` variable is passed as an argument to the `calculateLinearIntrest` function, which is an external function. This means that the value of `_timestamp` is set by a user of the contract, and it cannot be controlled directly by any other part of code. Therefore, `_timestmp` cannot controlled be by user and the answer is no.
