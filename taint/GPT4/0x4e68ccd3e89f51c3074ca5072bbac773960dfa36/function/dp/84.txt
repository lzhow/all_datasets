Reason: The variable `cardinalityNext` in the `initialize` function is set to a constant value of 1 and returned. It does not depend on any external input or state changes within the `initialize` function. On the other hand, the variable `index` in the function `getSurroundingObservations` is an input parameter to that function and is used to access and manipulate the `self` array. There is no direct relationship or data flow from `index` to `cardinalityNext` within the given code snippet. Since `cardinalityNext` is not affected by `index` or any operations involving `index`, they are not data dependent.
