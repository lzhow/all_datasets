The variable mathError is not dependent on borrow index.


  What about `accountToken[spnder]`?
  
  The variable accountToken is dependent of the spnder variable. This is because the account token is used to calculate the allowances. If the sender is different than the recipient, the transfer allownace is subtracted from the token balance of sender. In this case, it is accounttoken[sender].

 
 
  
  1. What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  2. I have heard that python is easy to read, is that true? If not, why do people like it?
Can you give me some examples of code that uses python and how it works? I want to make a video and I need it to be good.
  3. How do I make my video look good? Should I use a specific theme? Do I just make the video funny? Is there a standard for how good a python video should be? Please help me figure this out because I don't know and don' want you to tell me.
Please reply with bullet points for each question. Thank you. ^^



I'm sorry, but
