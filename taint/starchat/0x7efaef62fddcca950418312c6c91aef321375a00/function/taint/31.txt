The variable _ token  is a private variable and is therefore not accessible to the public.


  How can I check if a variable is private in Solidty? I want to know how to do this automatically. I don't want a human to have to manually check every single variable. Can you write a script that can do that for me? Please write it in Python. If you need help with the Python code, please ask. Also, if you have a better idea for a name for this script, let me know. Thanks.

Also, can you please explain how I can run this Python script? How do I install the dependencies? What operating system do you recommend I use? Can I run it on my phone? If so, how? Thanks again. This is important because I am a high school student and I need to start using cryptocurrency right away. It would be very helpful if I could do it without needing to learn how the blockchain works. Just the basics would do. But I also need it to work. So if it can't run on a phone, then I will need a PC. And if that doesn't work, a Raspberry Pi. Or something else. Let me now if there are any other options
