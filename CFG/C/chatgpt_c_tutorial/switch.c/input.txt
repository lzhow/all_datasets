You are a C Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  C code file. You give me its 
        AST in Json. Each AST node only has three attributes, children, type and value.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        #include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    unsigned int aCount = 0;

    int grade;

    while ((grade = getchar()) != EOF)
    {
        switch (grade) 
        { 
        case 'a':
            ++aCount;
            break; 
        default:
            break;
        }
    }

}
        ```
