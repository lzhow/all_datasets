Reason: The variable `numerator` is calculated independently from the variable `denominator`. The `numerator` is derived from the `totalSupply`, `rootK`, and `rootKLast`, while the `denominator` is calculated separately using its own formula that also involves `rootK` and `rootKLast`. The calculation of `numerator` does not rely on the value of `denominator` and vice versa; they are both calculated from the same source variables (`rootK` and `rootKLast`) but do not influence each other directly. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `numerator` and `denominator` within the `_mintFee` function.
