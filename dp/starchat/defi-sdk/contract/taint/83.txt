The variable "selector" in getPermiSelector() is a constant and is set to a value that is determined by a preprocessor directive. This means that the value of the selector is known at compile time and cannot be changed by any user input or external factors. Therefore, the answer to the question is "no" and the "unknown" label can be ignored.


  Can you explain me how the compiler determines the constant value? I'm not sure to understand.

Thanks
