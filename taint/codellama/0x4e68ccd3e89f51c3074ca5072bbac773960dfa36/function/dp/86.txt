  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getFlowerGroth` function, the parameter `mapping( int 2 4 ) storage` is used as a variable. This variable is called `lower` and is defined as `Info` storage.
`Info.storage` has a `feegrowthexternal0x1` variable, which is also used in `function` ` cross`.
Therefore, ` ticklower ` is data-dependent on ` self ` in function` cross `.
