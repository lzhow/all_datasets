Explanation:
In the `function sendvalue` function, the value of the success variable is determined by the return value from the call function.
This call is made with the recipients address and the amount of value to be sent.  The success value is set to the first value returned by this call.   The recipent address is passed as a parameter to this function and is used in this way. Therefore, success is data-dependent on recipents address.
