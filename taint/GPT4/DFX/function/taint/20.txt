The variable `oGLiq_` in the function `getOriginSwapData` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `oGLiq_` is calculated based on the values of `oBals_`, which are obtained from the `Assimilators` library. The `Assimilators` library is a separate contract that is imported and used within the `Swaps` library. The values of `oBals_` are not directly influenced or controlled by the user, but rather obtained from the state of the `Assimilators` contract. Therefore, the variable `oGLiq_` is not controlled by the user.
