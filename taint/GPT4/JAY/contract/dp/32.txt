Reason: The contract state `buyNftFeeJay` is a fixed fee amount set for buying NFTs with the JAY token. It is initialized with a value and can be updated by the `updateFees` function based on the latest price from the `priceFeed`. The variable `erc721TokenAddress` in the function `buyNFTs` is an array of addresses representing the ERC721 tokens that the user wants to buy. The fee `buyNftFeeJay` is used to calculate the total JAY tokens to burn when a user buys NFTs, and it is multiplied by the total number of NFTs being bought. However, the value of `buyNftFeeJay` itself does not depend on the contents of the `erc721TokenAddress` array or any other variable within the `buyNFTs` function. It is a predefined fee that applies regardless of which specific ERC721 tokens are being purchased. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `buyNftFeeJay` and `erc721TokenAddress`.
