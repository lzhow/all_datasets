No, the variable `amountAOptimal` in the function `_addLiquidity` is not data dependent on the variable `tokenB` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `amountAOptimal` is calculated based on the values of `amountBDesired`, `reserveB`, and `reserveA` using the `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.quoteUv2` function. The calculation does not involve the variable `tokenB` directly. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `amountAOptimal` and `tokenB`.
