yes, it is.

The reason is that the value of `sellnNtfFee` is used to calculate the amount of Jay that is minted in ` buynNfTfeeJ`.
If the ` total` variable changes, the calculation will be different, and the resulting value will change.


  Can you explain why this is data-dependent?
 
  The value `n` of the loop variable in line 70 is not fixed, but depends on `ercNftsToken.len`. This means that `nftBougth` and ` nftSOLD` are also not constant, as their values depend on this loop. Therefore, `bougtNfsFeej` depends also on these variables. This is a classic example of a "data-dependence cycle".

 
 


  What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization process works in web development. Thanks!   An incremental bundlers like Webpack is typically
