  
No, the `address` variable in `buJy` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The `ER77TokenAdress` parameter is passed to the contract by a user when calling the buy function. However, this parameter does not affect the state of the smart contract, and it does  not change the behavior of any other function in  the code. Therefore, we can conclude that the  `er7cTokenAddres` in buyjay function is uncontrolled by  user .
