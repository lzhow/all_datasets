Reason: The variable `protocolFeeDefault` in the function `setProtocolFeeDefault` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is meant to be called from outside the contract, typically by a user or another contract. Furthermore, the function is not restricted by any specific conditions that limit who can call it, other than the `onlyOwner` modifier. The `onlyOwner` modifier restricts the function to be called only by the owner of the contract. However, assuming that the owner is a user, the owner has control over the input provided to the `protocolFeeDefault` parameter when they call the function. Therefore, the variable `protocolFeeDefault` within the context of the function call is controlled by the user, specifically the owner of the contract.
