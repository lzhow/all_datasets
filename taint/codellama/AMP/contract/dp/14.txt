  
No, the variables ` recipientsImplemenation` and ` prefix` are independent.

The variable `_recipentImlementation ` is defined in function ` _ callPostTranfer Hooks` as the result of calling the `interfaceAddrs` function with the address of the contract and the string `AMP Tokens Recipients`. This function returns the implementation address for the interface `IAmp Tokes Recipiets` for a given contract address and interface name.  The implementation of this interface is not dependent on any other variable in this function.   The variable  `Prefix` is also defined as a local variable within the `_ callPartionStrategy Operator Hook` method. It is set to the value returned by the  `_get Partion Prefix` static method of  the`PartitonUtils` class. This method returns a bytes 4 value that represents the prefix of a partition. However, this value is only used to determine the name of an interface that is then passed to ` interface Addrs ` to retrieve the implementaion address. Therefore, ` PREFIX` does not depend on ` RECIPEINT IMPLEMENTATION`.
