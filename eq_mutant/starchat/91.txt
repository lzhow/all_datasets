No, these two Java functions are **not** semantic equivalent. Semantic equivalence requires that the output of the program is unchanged when different mutations are applied. In the first function, when `first` has a negative value, it will cause the loop termination condition to always be true. This means that in the mutated function the array will be sorted in reverse order, since the `lower` variable will always increase. Therefore the condition `if ( lower <upper)` will never be satisfied, and the for loop will terminate immediately. While in `mutant code 6` if `bound` starts with `-`, the termination of loop condition will only be reached when all elements are exhausted, causing the results to be the **same**.
