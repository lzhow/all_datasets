Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_balances` in the ERC777 contract is a mapping that keeps track of the token balances of each address. It is indirectly controlled by users through the functions that modify it, such as `send`, `transfer`, `burn`, `operatorSend`, `operatorBurn`, and `transferFrom`. These functions can be called by users to transfer tokens, which will result in changes to the `_balances` mapping. Therefore, the state of `_balances` is indeed controlled by the users' actions.
