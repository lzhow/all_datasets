Explanation:
In the `Address` library, the `_verifycallResult` function takes in three parameters: `success`, `retdata`, and `error_message`. The `verify_call_result` is called in `static_function_Call` and the return value is assigned to the local variable `_ret_data`.
Since the data parameter is passed to `address.functionCall`, it is data-dependent on `addr`. Therefore, `yes`
