Yes, the variable `_liquidity` in the function `viewLiquidity` is data dependent on the variable `curve` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `_liquidity` is calculated based on the value of `curve.assets[i].addr`, which is a member of the `curve` variable. Therefore, any change in the `curve` variable will affect the value of `_liquidity`.
