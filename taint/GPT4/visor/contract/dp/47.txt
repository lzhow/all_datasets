The variable `account` in the function `isContract` is not data dependent on the variable `target` in the function `functionCall`. In Solidity, data dependency implies that the value of one variable is derived from or influenced by the value of another. In this case, `account` and `target` are function parameters of two separate functions. There is no code within the provided Solidity library that establishes a connection between the two variables. Each function operates independently, and the value of `account` is not influenced by the value of `target` or vice versa. The functions do not share state, nor do they call each other or pass these variables between them in the given code snippet.
