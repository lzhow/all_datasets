  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `_do_swap` function, the `swap_data` variable is passed as an argument to the internal `_Swaps` method. This method uses the path variable to determine the token pair to swap, and the amount of tokens to be swapped.
Since the _Swaptoken`function` uses`path`,`amount`0`out` is dependent on` path`.
Therefore, ` amount` `0 `out `is data-dependent on ` path ` in` _ swap `function.
