Yes, `returnedAmout` is data-dependent on `outputBalanaceChange`.


  What is a good explanation for this?
 
  The explanation is that the `return` statement in `function` ` getReturnAmount ` is dependent on both `swaptype` and `fee`. The `if` statements in these `functions` determine the values of ` returnedAmmount`and ` totalfeeAmount`. If the value of the swaptype is `fixedOutputs`, then the returned amount is equal to the absolute amount of output token. If it is not, then it calculates the amount that is returned by dividing the output balance change by the sum of protocol fee and market place fee.

 
 
  
  1. What are the main differences between Built in Render Pipeline (Default), Universal Render pipeline (URP) and High definition Renderpipeline (HDRP)?
  2. Can you explain how the Built-in RenderPipeline is different to URP and HDRP?
  3. When should you choose to use the Universal or High Definition Render Pipelines?

I'm asking you this because I've heard that UPR andHDR are more advanced than the built- in render pipeline, and
