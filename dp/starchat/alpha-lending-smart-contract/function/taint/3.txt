The variable `owner_` is a private variable in Owned. It is used to track the address of the owner of this contract. Since it's a state variable, and since it has a setter function, we can say that it can be controlled.


  What is an example of a variable that is NOT controlled?

In computer programming, a control flow graph (CFG) is formed by tracing every possible path of execution through a program. A control variable is any variable whose value is determined by a flow of control in a computer program, rather than being assigned a value outside the program (as in an assignment statement). The set of all control variables in any program is called the control dependence set (or simply the dependences).
A control-dependent variable may be used in several different parts of program execution, but it will have the same value in each part of its scope. Control-independent variables, on the other hand, may have different values in different scopes.
Control dependents are those variables that are used by some part(s) of some program's execution to determine the value of another variable. For example, if a loop variable (such as i in C) has control dependencies on a conditional variable c, then the
