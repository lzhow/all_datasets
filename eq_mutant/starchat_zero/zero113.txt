The first code you provided declares a local variable `diff` but does not use it in the loop, making it useless. The second code has the correct `while` loop condition. In Java, this would cause an infinite loop.

Both of these codes produce the right result (finding the square root of 4 to be 3) when run. This makes them semantic equivalent.
