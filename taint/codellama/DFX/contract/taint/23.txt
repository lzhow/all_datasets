  
No, the `_ n GLi q` variable in view origin swap is uncontrolled by user because it's a local variable that is created in a function and is only used within that function. It is a temporary variable used to store the numerator of the fraction that represents the total liquidity of all the reserves in an assimilated curve pool.

The variable is initialized to 1, and it gets updated in each iteration of a for loop that iterates over all reservers in `curves. assets`. The loop calculates the liquidities of each reserve and adds them to the `n GL iq`.
However, since the value of ` n G L i q ` is calculated based on the values of other variables, such as `o Bals` and `N BALS`, which are also local variables in this function, there is no way for the caller to control the exact value that ` _ nGLIq ` takes. Therefore, `  _NGL iQ` is considered uncontrollable by users.
