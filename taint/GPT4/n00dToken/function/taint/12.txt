Label: no

Reason: The variable `_defaultOperators` is a private mapping defined in the `ERC777` contract which maps an address to a boolean indicating whether it is a default operator or not. Default operators are set when the contract is deployed and are typically addresses that have special permissions or roles within the contract's ecosystem. The function `constructor` of the `ERC777` contract initializes the `_defaultOperators` mapping with the addresses provided in the `defaultOperators_` parameter. Since this initialization happens only once when the contract is deployed and cannot be altered by users afterwards, the state of `_defaultOperators` is not controlled by the users but by the contract deployer or the logic defined within the contract. After deployment, users can only interact with this variable through the functions provided by the contract, such as `authorizeOperator` and `revokeOperator`, which modify the `_operators` mapping, not the `_defaultOperators` mapping directly.
