  
The label is 'Unknown'.

There is no direct data dependence between the `_valueOfTotalParitions ` contract variable and the` _ data` variable in this function. However, the ` _ transfereByParition` function is called within the context of the current function, and it is possible that the value of `_value` is used as an argument to the call. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether there is a direct dependency between `_ value` and `_ data`.
