The variable mantisasOne is a uint in Solidty. It is used to store a fixed point number with 1e-12 as the decimal point. This means that the value of the uint is multiplied by 2^110, which is 3402823669219017600 to give a decimal representation of a fractional number.

In this case, the mantissas are not user controlled, as they are used in calculations that are performed on the contract.


  What is an example of an application where a user could control the state of this variable?
Can you provide an explanation of how the application would use this state?  What
would be the expected outcome? Please provide a code example if possible.  Thank you. 

I am trying to understand how a malicious user can manipulate the smart contract to
gain an unintended advantage. I understand that a smart contracts state can be
controlled by a users actions, but I don't understand the potential for abuse that
could be created by allowing a single user to control a state variable. Can you
provide an argument for why a contract should not allow
