Label: no

Reason: The variable `_p_scope_0` in the function `updateFees` is a local variable that is used to calculate the new fee values based on the latest price from the `priceFeed`. It is not directly related to the `_totalSupply` state variable, which represents the total supply of the ERC20 token managed by the contract. The `_totalSupply` variable is typically modified by the `_mint` and `_burn` functions in ERC20 contracts, and there is no direct interaction or dependency between `_p_scope_0` and `_totalSupply` within the `updateFees` function or elsewhere in the provided contract code. Therefore, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
