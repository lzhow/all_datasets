  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the `borrwoBalancStorredInternal` function, the local variable  `MathErr matherr` is not directly dependent on any external variable. However, it is indirectly dependent because it depends on other variables that are dependent, such as `principle` and `interstIndex`.
On the other hand, in ` mintfresh` the external variables `comptroller` `mintr`and ` mintaMout` are used to calculate the value of ` mathError`. Therefore, ` MathErr ` is dependent in this function.
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is unknown.
