  
No, the amount variable in get Buy Jay No NFT function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The get buy Jay no Nft function takes an amount as a parameter and returns the number of Jays that can be bought with that amount of Ether. This function does not allow the caller to specify the value of the ` amount` variable, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user input.
