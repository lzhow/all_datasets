  
No, the `_deciamls` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a constant value that is set in constructor.

The reason is that the value of `_diemals ` is determined by a hardcoded value in ` constructor` function, which is `1` in this case. This means that `_ decims` will always have the same value and cannot be changed by any user input. Therefore, `_ decimal` cannot  be considered as a variable controlled directly by users.
