Explanation: Based on the given code snippet, it is not clear whether the contract state `curveFactory` is data dependent on the variable `_swapData` in the function `targetSwap`. The code does not show any direct interaction or assignment between these two entities. Therefore, without further information about the implementation of the `Swaps.targetSwap` function or the contract state `curveFactory`, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship between them.
