Reason: The contract state `INPUT_TYPEHASH` is a constant hash value computed from a specific string related to the structure of an `Input` object. It is defined as a constant at the contract level and is not modified during the execution of the contract. On the other hand, the variable `hashToCheck` in the function `isHashUsed` is a function argument that is used to check against the `isHashUsed_` mapping to determine if a hash has been used before. There is no interaction or dependency between `INPUT_TYPEHASH` and `hashToCheck` as they serve different purposes and are not used together in any computation or state change within the contract.
