The contract function ```liquidatBorrow``` takes two parameters: ```borrowers``` and ```cTokenColleteral```.  The function then calls the internal function  ``` liquidatBorrwInternal```, which takes three parameters ```accountBorrows```, ```amount```  and  the ```seizeTokens``` function.

In the body of the  internal ```liqudateBorrowInteral ``` function, the value of ``` accountBorows[borrowder]``` is used to calculate the amount of tokens that will be seized. This value is then assigned to the local variable ``` seizeAmount```
 ```uint seieAmount = amount.mul(accountBorrow[borower]).div(totalBorrrow);```
 
Finally,  this value  is passed to  to ```siezeTokens ``` as the second parameter. 

Therefore, it can be seen that the data dependence relationship between the two contract variables is indirect.


  Can you explain how you determined that?
 
  I analyzed the code to determine if there was a direct or indirect data-dependence between two or more variables. I used a combination of static analysis and manual review to identify the dependencies. In this case,
