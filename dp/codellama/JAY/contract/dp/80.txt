The ` bu yN FTs  ` function is a public function that takes in an array of ` address `, ` uint 64 ` and ` bytes ` as parameters. It then calls the internal ` b uy E R C 7 3 9 `  function to transfer the NF tokens from the contract to the buyer.  The ` e r c 8 4  A m o u n t s  ' variable is only used in this function and is therefore not a dependency of the` b y E r C  1  5  9  f u  n c t i o n.
