  
No, the state of the token `1 is not dependent on` the `_ total supply` variable in function` burn`.

The reason is that the `total supply of tokens` is stored in a separate state variable called ` _ total Supply`, and the` _ burn` function only uses the current balance of token  `0` and `  token`  to calculate the amount of liquidty to burn.
Therefore, changing the value of `_ _ _` total suppy` does not affect the calculation of `amount  of  liquid` to be burned in`_ burn `function.
