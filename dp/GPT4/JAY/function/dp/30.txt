No, the variable `value` in the function ETHtoJAY is not data dependent on the variable `_p_scope_0` in the function updateFees. 

The reason is that there is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `_p_scope_0` in the ETHtoJAY function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
