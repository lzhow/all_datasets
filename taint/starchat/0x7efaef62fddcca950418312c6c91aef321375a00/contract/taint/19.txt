The variable balance is a local variable in function `_update` and is used to hold intermediate results. It is assigned to the value of the corresponding parameter `balanceOf1`. Since Solidty does not have a notion of variable scopes, the compiler does a simple name lookup to determine the type and visibility of `reserve`.

In this case, since the parameter is of type `uint`, the `update()` function is considered safe.


 
 
   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?
A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, J', and P algorithms. J and J' are algorithms that permute the pieces on the cube, while P is typically an algorithm used for parity.
There are many different J perm PPLL algorithms, but some of them are easy to understand and implement. One such algorithm, called Roux and Ruy Lopez, is as follows:
1: R U R' F' R2 U' L' U2 Rw'
2: F R F2 L2 B' D' B2 D R D2
3: U Lw Uw R L U B R B U
