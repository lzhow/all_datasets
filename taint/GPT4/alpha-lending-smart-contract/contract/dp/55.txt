Label: no

Reason: The variable `_recipient` in the function `mintAlToken` is used to specify the address that will receive the minted tokens. It is a parameter of the `mintAlToken` function and is used within the scope of that function to call the `mint` function on the `alToken` object.

On the other hand, the function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmountExternal` does not take a `_recipient` parameter, nor does it reference or modify any state that would be influenced by the `_recipient` variable from `mintAlToken`. It is a view function that calculates and returns a value based on the parameters `_token` and `_amount`, and it does not interact with the `_recipient` variable in any way.

Since there is no interaction or shared state between `_recipient` in `mintAlToken` and any variable in `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmountExternal`, there is no data dependency relationship between them.
