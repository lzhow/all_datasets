Reason: The variable `value` in the function `safeTransferFrom` is used to specify the amount of tokens to be transferred from one address to another. It is passed as an argument to the `abi.encodeWithSelector` function along with the `token.transferFrom.selector` and the `from` and `to` addresses to construct the `data` bytes array that represents the encoded function call.

The function `_callOptionalReturn` takes the `data` bytes array as an argument and uses it to make a low-level call to the token contract. The `data` variable in `_callOptionalReturn` is used to interact with the token contract and does not depend on the `value` variable directly. Instead, `data` contains the encoded information of the `value` along with other arguments.

The data dependency would imply that the value of one variable is computed based on the value of another. In this case, `value` is an independent input to the `safeTransferFrom` function and is used to construct `data`, but once `data` is constructed, it does not rely on `value` anymore. The `data` is simply passed to `_callOptionalReturn` and used for the contract call. There is no computation or modification of `value` within `_callOptionalReturn` based on `data`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `value` in `safeTransferFrom` and `data` in `_callOptionalReturn`.
