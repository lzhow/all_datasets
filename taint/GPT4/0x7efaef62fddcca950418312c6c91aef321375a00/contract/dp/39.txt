The variable `_reserve1` in the function `_update` is data dependent on the variable `balance1` in the function `burn`. In the `burn` function, `balance1` is calculated as the balance of `token1` held by the contract minus any amount that is being burned. This value is then passed to the `_update` function, where it is used to update the `reserve1` state variable. The `_update` function takes `balance1` as an argument and assigns it to `reserve1` after performing some checks and calculations. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `balance1` in `burn` and `_reserve1` in `_update`.
