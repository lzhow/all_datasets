  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the `mulExp` function, the local variable  `a` is passed as an argument to the internal function call `Exp`, which creates a new `Math.Exp memory` object with the value of `m.m_a`. The `b` argument is also passed to `exp`, creating a second `math.exp memory object` with value `mb`. These two objects are then multiplied together using the multiplication operator, resulting in a single `Mat.Math memory ` object that is returned.
  The variable doubleScalledProduct is not directly dependent on ` a` or ` b` in ` mul Exp`.
   The function sub is a pure function that takes two arguments, `uint a`, ` uintb`, and a string `errorMessage`. It returns a uint. It does not have any local variables.  It is unclear whether the variables ` doubleScaleProduct ` and ` m ` in sub are related to each other. Therefore, we label the relationship as ' Unknown'.
