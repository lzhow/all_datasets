The contract state `owner_` is not data dependent on the variable `absoluteInputAmount` in the function `emitExecuted`. The `owner_` state variable is typically used to store the address of the contract owner and is managed by the `Ownable` contract, which is a common OpenZeppelin contract that manages ownership and access control. The `absoluteInputAmount` variable, on the other hand, is a local variable within the `emitExecuted` function that represents the absolute amount of input tokens involved in a transaction. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the `owner_` state and the `absoluteInputAmount` variable within the `emitExecuted` function or elsewhere in the provided code snippet. The `owner_` state is likely to be modified only by ownership transfer functions, while `absoluteInputAmount` is calculated and used within the context of a specific transaction and does not influence the ownership state.
