Yes

The variable `data` in the function `decodeI32` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `decodeI64` because `decodeI64` calls `decodeI32` within its function body. When `decodeI64` is called, it internally calls `decodeI32` twice to construct the 64-bit integer from two 32-bit integers. The `data` variable passed to `decodeI64` is the same `data` that is subsequently passed to `decodeI32`, and the state of `data.offset` is modified by `decodeI32` during its execution. This means that the output of `decodeI32` (and thus the state of the `data` variable within it) directly affects the computation and final result of `decodeI64`.
