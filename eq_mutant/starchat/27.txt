No, these are *not* semantic equivalent. Semantic equivalence typically means that the code has the exact same behavior when run with the identical inputs, and differentiates between two similar code snippets is not a reliable means of determining if those snippets are functionally equivalent as different code may have entirely different performance characteristics and behaviors based on factors such as compiler optimizations, runtime environment, or other factors.
