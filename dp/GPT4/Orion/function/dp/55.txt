Explanation: The variable `pool` in the function `getAmountOutCurve` is data dependent on the variable `x` in the same function. This is because the value of `pool` is assigned the result of the function `pairForCurve(factory, from, to)`, and the arguments passed to this function include `from` and `to`, which are dependent on the value of `x`. Therefore, any change in the value of `x` will result in a change in the value of `pool`, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
