Yes, the variable `borrowAmount` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is data dependent on the variable `borrowIndex` in the function `flywheelPreBorrowerAction`. 

Explanation: In the function `flywheelPreBorrowerAction`, the `borrowIndex` variable is passed as an argument to the `updateCompBorrowIndex` function. Inside the `updateCompBorrowIndex` function, the `borrowIndex` variable is used to calculate the `borrowAmount` variable. Therefore, there is a data dependency between these two variables.
