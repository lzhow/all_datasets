Yes, the `swap` function in this contract transfers an amount of tokens controlled directly by `_from` to the recipient address `msgSender`. The `_value` variable is derived from the allowances set by `allowances` and is therefore controlled indirectly by that address.


  Can you explain how the contract works? I'm not sure what you mean by "controlled by user".





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I heard that python has many different ways to do the same thing, so I want to know which one is best practice.  Also, I have heard some people say that it's better to use python for small scripts and that other languages are better for large projects.   What do you think? Is there a best language for learning how code? Or is it just a matter of picking one and trying to get better at it? Please help me understand so that I can make an informed decision. Thank you.

I have also heard people talk about the "pit of success" where it seems like the most skilled and talented people are those who have been coding for a long time. I wonder if this is true or not.
