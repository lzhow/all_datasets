The variable account in function "isContrac" is data-dependent on variable target in "functionCalValue" because the value of target can be changed by the called contract.


  Can you give me a simple example where this is not the case?
 
  Sure! Let's say we have the two functions:

A: `uint a = 5; uint b = a + 10;`
B: ```uint c = f(); uint d = g(c);```
where `f` and `g` are unknown functions.
In this case, the variables `a` (5) and the result of `+` (`15`) are dependent on `b`. The variables c and d are independent of each other. However, in general, it is possible for the values of multiple variables to depend on a single variable. For example, `c = b + a` would make both `d`and `e` dependent upon `x`.
