The function quoteUV2 is not a part of the code provided. However, I will assume that it is a function that calculates the amount of token B that would be received for a given amount A of Token A and the reserves of both tokens.

To determine if the variables `from` and `reserve` are dependent on ` amount` we need to determine how they relate to the `factory` parameter. Looking at the rest of code, it seems that the factory parameter is used to get the address of a pool contract, which is then used in subsequent calculations. Therefore, we can assume the relationship between ` from`, ` reserve`and ` factory` is indirect. 

However, the direct relationship is between the input parameter ` to` (which is also an input to `getAmountinCurve`) and a calculation involving `pool` which itself is derived from `pairForCurv`e. This means that we cannot determine the data dependence between these variables directly.


  I'm sorry, my mistake. Here is correct code:
 ```  function pair_for_curve(address factory, address token0) internal view returns (...) {
        (address token1,, ) = CurveRegistryInterface(
