   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and serving of web content works under the hood. Thanks!



  An incremental bundlers job is to take all the files that make up a web application and combine them into a single file that can be served to a user's browser. This allows for faster page loads and less overhead when a new user visits your site.

When you build a website using frameworks like React or Angular, you typically have many files, each of which contains code that is specific to that part of the application. An example of this is your JavaScript files which contain your React components, or your CSS files for styling. 

An incremental bundle takes these files and combines them together into one or more bundles that are served together to your users. These bundles can then be cached
