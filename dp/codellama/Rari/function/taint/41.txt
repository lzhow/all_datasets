  
No, the ` new Accrual` variable in update Contribution Rate is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created in a function and is only accessible within that function. It is also not a state variable, so it cannot be modified by any external actor. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled internally by this contract.

The reason for this is that the value of `NewAccumulated` is calculated based on the current block number and the contributors' comp speeds stored in `compContibutorSpeed`. This calculation is performed by calling the internal function `updateContributionRates`, which is called by other functions in this smart contract, such as `claimRwards`. Therefore the calculation of the new accumulated value is internal to this function, and it does not depend on any user input.
