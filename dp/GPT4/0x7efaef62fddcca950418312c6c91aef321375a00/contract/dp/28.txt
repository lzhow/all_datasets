The variable `_totalSupply` in the function `burn` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve0` in the function `burn`. The reason for this is that `_totalSupply` is used to calculate the amount of tokens to be burned (`amount0` and `amount1`) based on the liquidity provided by the caller of the function. The calculation of `amount0` and `amount1` uses `_totalSupply` in conjunction with `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` to determine the proportion of the pool's total supply that the liquidity represents. This proportion is then used to calculate the actual token amounts to be burned and sent to the address `to`. The dependency is established through the following lines of code within the `burn` function:

```solidity
uint _totalSupply = totalSupply; // _totalSupply is assigned the current total supply of the contract
amount0 = liquidity.mul(balance0) / _totalSupply; // amount0 is calculated using _totalSupply
amount1 = liquidity.mul(balance1) / _totalSupply; // amount1 is also calculated using _totalSupply
```

Since `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` are used to calculate the balances `balance0` and `balance1` before the burn operation, and these balances are then used in conjunction with `_totalSupply` to determine `amount0` and `amount1`, there is a clear data dependency between `_totalSupply` and `_reserve0` within the context of the `burn` function.
