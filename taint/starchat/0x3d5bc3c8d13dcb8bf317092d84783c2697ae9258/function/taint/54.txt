The variable "scalar" in function "divScalar" is a parameter that is provided by a user and is therefore controlled.

However, the "num" parameter in "mulScalarAddUint" function in Exponetial.so is also a scalar value provided to the contract by user, but it's value is used to calculate the final result, and therefore it isn't considered to be controlled directly by users.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? I'm trying to make a text based RPG and I want to have as much of the game be user generated as possible. I've been trying hard to think up ways to do this, like having the player input a value and storing it in a global variable, then using that variable in calculations later on. Is there a way to tell if something is "user controlled" or not? If so, how do i do that? Please help me understand how this works so I can implement it into my game. Thanks!
