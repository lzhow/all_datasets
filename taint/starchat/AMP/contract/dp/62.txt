The variable _ tokenHolder in function `isoperator` is data-dependent on variable `value`_ in `_removetokenfrompartition` because the `_isoperato`r function checks if the`_operator`_ address is equal to the` _ _holder` address or if it is in`_authorizedoperator[_ _Holder]`. The`_removetokenfro mpartitio`n function decrements the balance of the token holder and the total supply of tokens. If the removed token balance is  zero, then the partition is removed from the list of partitions of `_from`. If `_partition`is not the default partition, and if there are no more tokens in that partition for `_ _From`, then `_ partition` will be removedfrom the array of total partitions.
