  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `if` statement checks if `feeto` is not equal to zero. If it is, then the code inside the block is executed. This block includes the calculation of `liqudity` and the `_ mint` function.
`numerato`r is calculated inside this block, and it depends on `rootk` which is also calculated in this same block. `Rootklast`is also used in calculating ` numerato`.
Therefore, `Numerator `is data-dependent on`denomino` because it uses the same variables as `Denominato`, which are ` rootk `and ` Rootklas`.
