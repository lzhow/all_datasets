The answer is no.

In the `mintAllowed` function, `ctoken` and `supplyCaps[]` are both state variables, and neither is modified in this function. Therefore, there is not a direct data dependence relationship between `ctoken` or `supplCaps []`and ` minAmount`.
However, the `_SetMarketSupplCap`function modifies the state variable` supplycaps []`. Therefore there may be a indirect data-dependence between the two functions.


  How can I check if there are indirect dependencies between my contract's variables?
 
  You can use a tool like Mythril to check for indirect variable dependencies in your Solidiy smart contract. MythX is another option. Both of these tools can help you identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues in smart contracts. Additionally, you can also use static code analysis tools like SonarQube to perform a deeper analysis of your code. These tools will help identify issues like unused variables and dead code, as well as potential security vulnerabilites. Finally, it's important to note that these checks are just a starting point, but they can be an effective way to identify some potential issues. It's always a good idea to
