  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `uint245` variable is assigned the value of `amount. mul( 1ether ).div ( 0.001 )` and the result is then converted to a ` uint 22` using the` uint` function.
Then, in line 3, ` basevalue` is set to ` result` .
Therefore,` base value` depends on ` amount` , which is a function parameter.
