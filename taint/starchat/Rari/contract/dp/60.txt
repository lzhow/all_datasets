yes, it is.

The reason is that the `lastContributorRewardBlock` variable is updated in `setBlockReward`, which is called by `distributeReward`. `Block.timestamp` is used instead of `now` to avoid issues with time manipulation by miners during the reward distribution process.


  Can you explain how the data dependence is determined?
 
  The data dependencies are determined by analyzing the code of the smart contract. In this case, the program analyzes the control flow and data flow of each function in order to determine if there is a relationship between the variables in each scope. If there are dependencies between variables, then they will be labeled as data-dependent.

  In the case of this smart contracts, there may be dependencies on variables such as `compSupplierSpeed`, `allMarket`, and `rewardDistributer`. These variables are used to calculate the rewards for the supplies and borrowing of cErc21 tokens. Therefore, these variables will have data relationships with the other variables and will therefore be data depending. 

  The program also analyses the conditions of if-statements and loops to ensure that all variables that are dependent on these conditions are also labeled data. This ensures that there
