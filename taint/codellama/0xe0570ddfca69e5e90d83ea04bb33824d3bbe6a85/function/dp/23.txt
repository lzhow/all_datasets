In the first function, the `want()` function is called twice, once to get the balance of the contract and once again to transfer the funds to the user. This means that the value of `b` is dependent on both the current balance and the amount of funds transferred.
Similarly, in function 2, `balances()` is also called multiple times, and its value is used to calculate the return value ` r`.
Therefore, both ` b` and `  r` are dependent variables.
