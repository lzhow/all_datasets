  
No, the variables `_operater` and `_token` are independent in function `mInt`. The variable ` _operatpr` is a parameter of the `_ mint` function, and the `to _` variable is an internal variable of `_addtokenToParition` that is called by `_ mInt` . Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.

The reason for this is that the value of `operator _ ` is determined by the caller of function` _ mint`, and it is not affected by any other variables in `_ addTokentoPariton`. Similarly, ` to _ _`, is also an independent variable that determines the behavior of`_addtokentoParion`, but it does not depend on any external variables. Therefore there are no dependencies between these two functions.
