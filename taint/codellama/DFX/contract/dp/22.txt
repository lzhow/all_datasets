In the `getTargetswapdata` function, the `_bal` variable is assigned the value of `Assililatros.ViewNumarairebalance` which is a function that returns the balance of the assimilater.
Then, in `ViewTargetswapedata`, the same `_assil` is used to get the amount and balance.  The `_amount` and `_Bal` are then used in a calculation.   The variable _amount is then subtracted from the _Bal. This means that the calculation is dependent on _Assi.
