No, the variable `success2` in the function `sell` is not data dependent on the variable `startedAt` in the function `getLatestPrice`. 

The reason is that there is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of the variable `startedAt` in the function `getLatestPrice` that affects the variable `success2` in the function `sell`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
