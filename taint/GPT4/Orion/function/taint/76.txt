Explanation: The variable `N_COINS` in the function `get_D` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the value of `xp.length`, which is the length of the `xp` array passed as an argument to the function. The length of the array is determined by the caller of the function and is not controlled by the user within the function itself.
