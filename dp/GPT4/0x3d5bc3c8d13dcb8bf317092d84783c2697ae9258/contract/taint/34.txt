Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `cToken` in the function `getUnderlyingPrice` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. Since external functions can be called by any user or contract outside of the contract that contains the function, the value of `cToken` is indeed controlled by the user who calls the function. The user can pass any `CToken` contract address that they choose when they invoke `getUnderlyingPrice`.
