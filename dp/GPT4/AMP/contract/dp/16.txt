Yes

The contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `_value` in the function `_removeTokenFromPartition`. This is because within the `_removeTokenFromPartition` function, `_balances[_from]` is modified using the `.sub(_value)` method from the SafeMath library. This method subtracts the value of `_value` from the balance of the address `_from` in the `_balances` mapping, which directly affects the state of `_balances` based on the value of `_value`.
