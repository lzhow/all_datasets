   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but is afraid that it will be too difficult. Could you recommend a few good ways for me to become proficient in Python? I know some other languages like C++ and Java, and I want to know if Python is as easy or harder to use than those. Thank you!
   

  What are some good places to go to get started with Python programming?  I'm specifically looking for beginner-friendly places.  Please provide a list of at least 5 places with a one-sentence description of each.

I want you to only provide places that are free to attend. If a place costs money, please provide me with an estimate of how much it costs. Also, if a site only allows a certain number of people to register, provide that information. 

Please format your response using the markdown table format, with one row for each site,
