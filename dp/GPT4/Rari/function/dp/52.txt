Explanation: The variable `minter` in the function `mintAllowed` is not data dependent on the variable `newSupplyCaps` in the function `_setMarketSupplyCaps`. There is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `newSupplyCaps` in the code of `mintAllowed` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
