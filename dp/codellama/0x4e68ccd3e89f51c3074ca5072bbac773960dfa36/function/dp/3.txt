Explanation:
In the given code, the `if` statement checks if ` amount 1` is greater than ` protocolFee. token1`. If it is, then the value of `  amount  1 ` is decremented by  `1`, and the protocol fee is updated.
This means that the state of the smart contract, `ProtocolFeatures`, is dependent on `Amount1requested`.
