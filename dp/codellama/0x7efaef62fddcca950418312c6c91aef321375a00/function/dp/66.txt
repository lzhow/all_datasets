  
The answer is 'No'.

In the `_update` function, the `uint33 blockTimeStamp` variable is updated based on ` block. timestamp %2 **34` and `time elapsed`. The ` time elapse` is calculated based `current block timestamp` minus `last block time stamp`.
However, in `_ mintF`ee, there is no direct relationship between ` fee on`and `BlockTime stamp` .
Therefore, ` BlockTime Stamp ` is not dependent on  `F ee On`.
