Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `index` in the function `isWhitelisted` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function, but there is no indication in the provided code snippet that the user has control over its value. The value of `index` is determined by the caller of the function, which could be a user or another contract. Without further context or information, it is not possible to determine if the variable is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label is "unknown".
