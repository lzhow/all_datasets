yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_symbol` variable is used in two places:
1. In the `name()` function, which is called by the inherited `IER2C2Metadata` interface. This means that `this._symbol()` is a function call that depends on `msg.sender`.
2. As the value of the private `_name` field. Since this field is not modified after construction, this means the entire contract state is dependent on this value.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  The reason why the symbol_ variable in constructor is data-dependent on amount in _Burn function is because the _Symbol variable stores the string value that represents the token symbol. When the contract is deployed, the constructor function sets the initial value for the '_symbol' variable. However, after the deployment, there is no way to change the name of a token after it has been deployed. Therefore, any function that references the'symbol_' variable must be dependent upon the amount variable, as it will be affected by changes to '_totalsupply' in '_burn' function. 

In other words, if the total supply of tokens is changed, then the reference to 'amount
