Label: yes

Reason: The variable `tokenAmount` within the `hash` function is of type `TokenAmount`, which is a struct that likely represents an amount of tokens and associated data. This variable is passed as an argument to the `hash` function, which is called within other functions that are marked as `public` or `external`. These functions can be invoked by anyone interacting with the contract, including users. Since users can call these functions and provide the `tokenAmount` data, it is controlled by the user.
