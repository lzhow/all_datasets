Label: yes

Reason: The variable `userData` in the function `setUserUseAsCollateral` refers to a specific user's pool data for a given token, which is accessed via `userPoolData[msg.sender][address(_token)]`. This same mapping, `userPoolData`, is accessed in the function `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance` to retrieve `userBorrowShares` for the same user and token combination: `userPoolData[_user][address(_token)].borrowShares`. Since both variables are accessing and potentially modifying the state of the same user's data for a specific token within the `userPoolData` mapping, there is a data dependency relationship between `userData` and the data accessed in `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance`. Changes made to `userData.disableUseAsCollateral` in `setUserUseAsCollateral` could affect the conditions or outcomes of operations in `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance`, such as the calculation of the compounded borrow balance, which may depend on whether the collateral is enabled or not.
