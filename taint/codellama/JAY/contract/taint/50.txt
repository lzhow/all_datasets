  
No, the ` id` variable in function `buyerc 751` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be changed by users.

The ` buyerc 57` function is an internal function, which means that it cannot be called from outside the contract. Therefore, any changes made to the local variables in this function will not affect the state of the smart contract, and the value of `  id ` will remain the same.
