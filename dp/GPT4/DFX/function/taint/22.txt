Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `curve` in the function `viewLiquidity` is passed as a parameter to the function. Without further information about how this parameter is obtained or modified before being passed to the function, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label is "unknown".
