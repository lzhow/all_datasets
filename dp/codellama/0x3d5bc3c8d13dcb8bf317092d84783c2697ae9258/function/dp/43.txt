In the ` mulScale` function, the value of ` scaleM antissa ` is calculated by multiplying `a` and `scalar`. The value ` a ` comes from the input parameter of the same name, and the parameter ` scalar ` also comes directly from an input. Therefore, ` scal edM an tissa  ` depends on ` b ` in ` m u lExp 3 ` because `  b  `.
However, it is not clear whether `m u  l Exp 2 ` uses the result of this function. If it does, then `s c a l e dM a n t i s s a  ' is data-dependent on` b `. However, if it doesn't, or if the data is modified in between, this dependency is broken.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether the two are dependent or not.
