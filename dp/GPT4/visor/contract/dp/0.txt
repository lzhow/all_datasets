yes

The contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `mint`. The reason is that within the `mint` function, the `_mint` internal function is called, which in turn modifies the `_balances` mapping for the `account` specified. The `amount` variable is added to the current balance of the `account` in the `_balances` mapping, which establishes a direct data dependency between `_balances` and `amount`.
