They are syntactically equal, meaning they execute the exact same function regardless of whether or not they contain certain programming errors, but they do not have exactly the sam e meaning. In the first code snippet, the purpose of the program is to calculate an employee's salary based on their annual salary. The program takes the user's annual salar as input, and then determines the employee bonus based off of a set of different rules and conditions.
In the second code block, there is a typo which is causing the calculation to be incorrect. Specifically, on line 19, where the value of `i` is being substracted from 2M instead of being added to it. This could result in the `if` statement evaluating to `true` regardless if `annual salary <= 4M`, resulting in a bonus of 0 being applied to every salary regardless, leading to the incorrect output of calculating the bonus correctly.
