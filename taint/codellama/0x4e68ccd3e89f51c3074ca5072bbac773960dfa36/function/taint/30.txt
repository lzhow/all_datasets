  
The variable 'inv' in function 'mulDiv' is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the value of 'denomintor' can be controlled directly by a user, and the 'twos' variable is calculated using the bitwise AND operation with the denominatior, which can also be influenced by user input.
Therefore, the calculation of the inverse of denominatoir can not be guaranteed to be secure.
