Yes, the variable `borrower` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp` is data dependent on the variable `borrower` in the function `flywheelPreBorrowerAction`. 

Explanation: The variable `borrower` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp` is passed as an argument to the function `distributeBorrowerComp`. In the function `flywheelPreBorrowerAction`, the same variable `borrower` is passed as an argument to the function `distributeBorrowerComp`. Therefore, the value of the variable `borrower` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp` depends on the value of the variable `borrower` in the function `flywheelPreBorrowerAction`.
