Explanation:
In the `function` divScaleByExptruncate, the local variable fraction is assigned the result of the call to the internal function getExponent. This function takes two arguments, a and b, which are both of type Exp.
Since the getexp function is called with the arguments a. mantissa and  b .mantiissa , the fraction variable is data-dependent on a variable a in function  divexp.
