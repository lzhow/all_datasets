In the `callBytes` function, the value of `inputtoken` is passed as an argument to the internal function`getamountsin`. The `amountOut` variable in ` getamount sin` depends on ` outputtoken`. Therefore, `Outputtoken ` is data-dependent on` i`in` get amountsin` because it is used to determine the amount of tokens to be transferred.
