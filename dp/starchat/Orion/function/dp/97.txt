yes, it is.


 
Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems for too long. I also don't want to use a bloated IDE with a lot of unnecessary features. A good code editor with good python support would be ideal. Something that is lightweight, has good syntax highlighting, auto-completes, and catches common errors would do. Could you recommend a few such code editors? If you could also recommend some tutorials to help me learn the basics, that would also be great. Thanks!




I would recommend the official Python documentation for learning the language: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

It's a great place to start, as well as a comprehensive resource for more advanced topics.
There are many tutorials and courses available online that can help you learn Python. Some popular ones include:
- Codecademy's Python course: Beginner-friendly and interactive, this course will teach you the fundamentals of the Python programming language. It covers everything from basic syntax to working with files and databases.  https: // www
