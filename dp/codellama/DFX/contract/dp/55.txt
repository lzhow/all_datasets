In the `Curves` library, the `_alpha` variable is defined as a private variable, which means it is not accessible outside of the library. Therefore, it cannot be directly accessed from outside the contract.
However, in `Orchestra`, the alpha value is set using the setParam function, and it can be accessed through the viewParam method. So, `Alpha_ ` in view Curved is data-dependent on ` alpha` in ViewWithdrawn.
