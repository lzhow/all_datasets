No. The variable `amountA` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the `amountADesired` and the reserves of `tokenA` and `tokenB`. The user provides the `amountADesired` as an input, but the final value of `amountA` is determined by the contract's internal calculations. Therefore, the user does not have direct control over the value of `amountA`.
