Both codes seem to have a valid syntax, but as I cannot compile and execute them, I am not able to say for sure if both codes do the exact same thing.

Are you sure that these are the original files and that there isn't anything else that might be causing this error?
Can you confirm that you are compiling and executing them correctly and can actually see the output they produce? If not, please double check that your code is correct.
