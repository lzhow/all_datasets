The variable swaptype is a swap type enum that is used to determine the swap behavior. It is set by a user and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? I have read that you can use a technique called "control-flow integrity" to prove that a certain variable or value is only controlled or modified by certain parts of the code. How would I go about doing that with this code? Can you give me an example of how I could use control-flor integrity to verify that swaptye is indeed user-controlled? Please provide a step-by-step explanation. I am a bit confused about how to apply this technique to my code, and any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I am also wondering if you could provide me with a list of all the variables in this contract and whether or not they are user or program controlled, along with an explanation of why you believe they should or should not be. This would help me greatly in understanding the contract better. If you are able to provide this information, that would also be great. 

Thank you for your help. Your assistance is greatly appreaciated.
