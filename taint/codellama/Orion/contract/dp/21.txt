In the `SaferMath` library, the functions `tryAdd`, `sub`, and `mul` are defined. These functions are used to perform arithmetic operations on unsigned integers.
  The `a` and` b` variables are the inputs to these functions, and the` c` variable is used as a temporary variable to store the result of the operation.  In the case of ` add`, the value of` a` is added to the  value  of  ` b`,  and  the   result  is stored  as  a  new  variable  called  c.   The  function  then  returns  this  result. In this case, ` c ` is data-dependent on ` a ` and on`b`.
   In  general, data dependencies are relationships between variables that determine the values of one or more variables based on other variables. Data dependencies can be either direct or indirect. Direct data  dependencies  occur  when  one  or  more  variables  are  used  to  determine  another  directly. Indirect data dependences occur when one variable determines another indirectly through a third variable.
