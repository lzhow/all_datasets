There is no direct data dependence between the two functions. However, there is a possibility that the `cancelAccountSignture` function could be called from within the context of the`getReturneAmountss`function, in which case the value of ` marketPlaceFess` could potentially be used in ` cancelAccounSignatures`.
However, this is not a direct dependency, and the dependency is only implied by the fact that ` getRetunedAmounss ` could call ` cancellAccountsSignaturess`.
