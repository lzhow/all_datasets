Sure, here are my findings:

1. Yes, these two code snippets are considered semantic equivalent since they both have exactly the sam eoutput when run with the exact same inputs. This is due to the fact that both of these codes perform the correct operations on the input variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, which leads to exactly identical outputs. 

2. No, both these code snippes have compiler errors when compiled. In the first snippet, `abs()` is not defined for the `t` variable used in the if-statement on line 9, while the second snippet does not have this error. Additionally, even if this function were defined, it would not be clear what the meaning of the code would be if `f()` was run on inputs such as `(-1, 5, -7)` since `1` would always be returned in this case, which would violate the constraints specified in `main()`.
In summary, neither of this code pair are truly semantic equvalent and cannot be considered equal in a mathematical sense.
