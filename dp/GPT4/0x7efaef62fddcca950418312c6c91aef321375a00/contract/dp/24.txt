The variable `liquidity` in the function `_mintFee` is data dependent on the variable `amount0` in the function `mint`. In the `mint` function, `amount0` is calculated based on the difference between the current balance of `token0` and the stored `reserve0`. This `amount0` is then used to calculate `liquidity` when the total supply is not zero:

```solidity
liquidity = Math.min(amount0.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve0, amount1.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve1);
```

The `liquidity` calculated in the `mint` function is then passed to the `_mint` function, which is called within `mint`:

```solidity
_mint(to, liquidity);
```

The `_mint` function internally calls `_mintFee` if the `feeOn` flag is true:

```solidity
bool feeOn = _mintFee(_reserve0, _reserve1);
```

Within `_mintFee`, the `liquidity` variable is potentially modified if certain conditions are met, specifically if there is a fee to be minted:

```solidity
if (liquidity > 0) _mint(feeTo, liquidity);
```

Therefore, the `liquidity` in `_mintFee` is indirectly dependent on the `amount0` in `mint` because the calculation of `liquidity` uses `amount0`, and the resulting `liquidity` may be used in `_mintFee` to mint additional liquidity tokens if fees are enabled.
