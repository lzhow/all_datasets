The contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `_mint`. This is because the `amount` variable directly influences the value that is added to `_balances[account]` through the statement `_balances[account] = _balances[account].add(amount);`. The `.add` function is used to safely add the `amount` to the current balance of the `account`, which means that the new balance stored in `_balances` for the `account` is calculated based on the input `amount`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `_balances` and `amount`.
