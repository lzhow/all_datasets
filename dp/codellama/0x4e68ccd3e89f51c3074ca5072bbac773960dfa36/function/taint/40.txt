The variable 'blocktimestamp' is a state variable in a struct called 'Obseration'. The struct is defined in line 3 of the code. It is initialized in lines 4-5 of code, and it has a private access modifier. Therefore, the value of 'Blocktimestamp is set by a function in this contract, but it cannot be controlled directly by an external user, as it does not have a public accessor.
