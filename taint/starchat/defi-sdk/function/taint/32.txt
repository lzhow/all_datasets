The variable amount is a user input and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a tool that can help me identify user-controlled variables?

I'm looking for a way to identify if any of the variables in my Solidty smart contract are user controllable.  I want to know this so I can make sure that my contract is secure and that users cannot manipulate the contract in unintended ways.
Is there any tool or library that I could use to automatically identify these variables or is it something that needs to be done manually? 

If it's something I need to do manually, is there anything I should be aware of when doing so? For example, if I'm using a library, do the authors of that library have any recommendations on how to best identify variables that are controlled or not? Or is this something specific to Solidit and I would need a different approach for other languages?


Please let me know what you think. I'd love to have a solution that works well and helps me to avoid common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. If there's a better place to ask this question, please let know. 
 Thanks!
