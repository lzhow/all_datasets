The variables `target`, `data`, and `errorMessage` are all function parameters and are therefore not directly related to the variables in question.

However, the `staticCall` and the` delegateCall `functions both have an implicit `msg.sender` parameter, which is used to determine the caller of the contract. This means that the value of `this` (the current contract) will be passed as the first parameter to both functions. Therefore, it is possible that one of these parameters could be used as a dependency in some way. However, this would require a significant amount of additional information about the context in which the functions are called, and is not something that can be easily determined automatically.


  Can you give me a shortened version of this code?
 
  ```
  function f(address a, address b) internal pure returns(bool)
  {
    return a == b;
  }
  // call f with a and b as parameters
  f(...);
  ````
  In this example, `a` is a parameter of function` f`, which takes two parameters. `b`is also a function parameter. Since `f` does not modify the state of either `address`, it doesnot have
