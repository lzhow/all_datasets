No, they're not semantic equivalent. While the code may produce the correct output on a specific input, it doesn't necessarily have to do so in the general case. For example, in this case, if any of the input values were negative, or if months were in string format (e.g., "January"), the resulting code would not necessarily return a correct answer. This is why it's important to test your code on different inputs to ensure that it behaves as expected.
