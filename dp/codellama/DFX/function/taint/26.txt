  
No, the `_ totalShell` variable in function `proportionWithDraw` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it doesn't have any user input.

The `_withDrawal` parameter is passed to the `viewPropotionalwithdra` function, which is a view function that doesnâ€™t modify the state of the contract. Therefore, `_ withDrawl` cannot be controlled directly by a user, and the value of `_totaShell` will always be the same.
