Label: no

Reason: The variable `mErr` in the function `getAccountSnapshot` and the variable `error` in the function `_setReserveFactor` are local variables within their respective functions. They are not related to each other and do not share any state. Each function call operates in its own context, and the variables are initialized and used independently within those contexts. There is no data flow or dependency between `mErr` and `error` as they are scoped to their functions and are not influenced by each other's state or value.
