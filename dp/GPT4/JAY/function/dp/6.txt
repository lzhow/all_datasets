Explanation: The variable `success2` in the function `sell` is data dependent on the variable `eth` in the same function. This can be observed from the line `(bool success2, ) = dev.call{value: eth.div(33)}("");` where the value of `eth` is used to calculate the amount of ether transferred to the `dev` address. Any change in the value of `eth` will affect the value of `success2`, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
