Yes

The contract state `totalSupplyByPartition` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `swap`. The reason for this is that within the `swap` function, the `_mint` function is called with `amount` as one of its arguments. The `_mint` function internally calls `_addTokenToPartition`, which modifies the `totalSupplyByPartition` mapping by increasing the total supply for the `defaultPartition` by the value of `amount`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between the `amount` variable and the `totalSupplyByPartition` state, as the value of `amount` directly influences the change in `totalSupplyByPartition`.
