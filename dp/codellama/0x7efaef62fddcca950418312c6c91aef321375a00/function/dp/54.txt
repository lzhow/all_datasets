  
No, the variables `_ reserves1 ` and ` amount 1  ` are independent.

The reason is that the `_ reserve1 _` variable is defined in a different scope than the `balances` function. It is a local variable in `getReserve` and is not accessible outside of that function's scope. Therefore, it is independent of the` amount` variables in other functions.
