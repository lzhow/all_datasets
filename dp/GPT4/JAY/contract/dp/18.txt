Yes

The variable `_p_scope_0` in the function `updateFees` is data dependent on the variable `price` in the same function. The reason for this is that `_p_scope_0` is calculated based on the value of `price` after it is converted from `int256` to `uint256` and multiplied by `1 * 10**10`. The calculation of `_p_scope_0` directly uses the `price` variable to determine its value, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
