In the constructor function, the `EIP-721` constructor is called with the arguments `name` and `verison`. The `hashed_name_` variable is initialized with a hash of the concatenation of `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(version, name))`. Therefore, `_hash_edname ` is data-dependent on ` version` because it is derived from `versio`n.
