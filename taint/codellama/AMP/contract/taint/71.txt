  
No, the `_ authorized Operator` variable in this function does not control the contract. It is a mapping that stores the relationship between the operator and the token holder. This mapping is used to determine whether an operator is authorised to perform certain actions on behalf of a tokenholder.

The reason for this is that the mapping's key is an address, which is determined by a user' s action. Therefore, this mapping does control user data.
