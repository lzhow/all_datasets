  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `SaferMath` library, the functions `add`, `mul`, and `div` are defined with the same signature, which includes the variables `a` and` b`. The `require` statement in these functions checks whether the result of the operation is greater than or equal to the first operand, and if not, it reverts the transaction.
Therefore, in each of these three functions, ` a` is data-dependent on ` b`, because the value of `c` (the result) depends on both `  a `and ` ` .
Similarly, for the` sub` function, since the return value depends directly on` a`, the data dependence relationship between ` and b` exists.
