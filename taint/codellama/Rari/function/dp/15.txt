  
No, the variables `redemption` and `borrowing` are independent.

The variable`vars `in the ` redemptive` function is a local variable that is defined within the scope of the` redenemption `function. It is not accessible outside of this function, and it is therefore not dependent on any external variables.  On the other hand,the variable  ` allowed`in  the  function  is ` repaid` is an external variable, which is accessible from outside the local scope. Therefore, it can be modified by other functions, making it a potential source of data dependence. However, in this case, there is no evidence of a direct data connection between the two functions.
