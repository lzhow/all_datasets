  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `target.cal`l function is called with the argument `value` and ` data`. The `success` variable is assigned the return value of the call, which is a tuple of two values: a boolean indicating whether the transaction was successful, and a bytes array containing the data returned by the called contract.
Since the value ` retu`nddata is returned from the cal`led function and is used as an argument in another function call in ` _`verify`Call`Result, it is data-dependent on `da`ta.
