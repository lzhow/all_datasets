   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

Here are some steps you can follow to get started with Python:

1. Choose a development environment: You can write Python code on any text editor or IDE, such as Notepad, Sublime Text, or PyCharm. However, to run and test your code, you'll need a Python interpreter. Popular Python interpreters include CPython, IronPython and PyPy.

2. Get familiar with basic syntax: Python has many similarities to other programming languages, but there are also some differences to be aware of. For example, Python uses zero-based indexing, and uses the # symbol to denote a comment, whereas some other languages like C++ and Java use  based indexing and use // for comments. Additionally, there is no requirement to use semicolons to end statements, although they can be used for readibility.
