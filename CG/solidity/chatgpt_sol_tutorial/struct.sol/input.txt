You are a Solidtiy Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a Solidtiy code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has two attributes, type and value.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.9.0;
contract S {
    struct V { 
        uint w;
        bool t;
        address d;
        uint h;
    }
}
        ```
