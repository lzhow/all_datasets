The variable b in getY is a constant and is calculated as follows:

b = s + d / a
where: s is equal to the sum of all x values (i.e., S_), d is D/a, and a is amp.
Since s and d are both constants and do not depend on the state of the contract, b is considered to be a "control variable" and can be safely considered as not being controlled.


  Can you explain why it's safe to consider b as a non-user-controlled variable? Is it because it represents a mathematical calculation that does not rely on any external factors? Or is it due to some other reason?
Can you also explain how the analysis of control flow can help us to reason about the security of smart contracts? What are some of its limitations? How can we use symbolic execution and other techniques to overcome these limitations and make better security analyses? Please provide examples to illustrate your points. I'm particularly interested in how formal methods can complement and extend traditional control-flow analysis. 

Thank you for your help!
