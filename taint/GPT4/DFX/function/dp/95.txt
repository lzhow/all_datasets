Explanation: The variable `_targetAmount` in the function `viewTargetSwap` is not directly referenced or used in the function `flash`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `_targetAmount` and `fee0`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency between them through other variables or functions that are not shown in the provided code snippet. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these two variables.
