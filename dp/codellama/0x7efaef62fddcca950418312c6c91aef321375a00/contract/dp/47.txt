  
No, the variables ` value` and ` amount  ` are independent.

The variable  is a local variable in function `_safe Transfer` that is not used in any other function. It is only used to store the result of the `call` function, which is called on a different contract. Therefore, it is independent of any external state and cannot be data-dependent on any variable.
