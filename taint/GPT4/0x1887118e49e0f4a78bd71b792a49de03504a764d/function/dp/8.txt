Label: no

Reason: The variable `_oracles` in the constructor function is an input parameter that is used to initialize the `oracles` mapping with the corresponding `underlyings` as keys. The variable `i` in the `add` function is a loop counter used to iterate over the `underlyings` array and update the `oracles` mapping with new values from the `_oracles` input parameter of the `add` function. There is no data dependency between `_oracles` in the constructor and `i` in the `add` function because they are used in separate contexts and for different instances of data. The variable `i` does not influence the data in `_oracles` in the constructor, nor does the data in `_oracles` in the constructor influence the value of `i` in the `add` function. Each function operates independently with its own scope and input parameters.
