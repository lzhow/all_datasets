Label: no

Reason: The variable `data` in the function `functionStaticCall` and the variable `target` in the function `functionDelegateCall` are parameters of two different functions. They are scoped to their respective functions and there is no direct relationship or dependency between them within the context of the provided code. Each function operates independently, and the variables are not used to modify, influence, or determine the value of one another. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
