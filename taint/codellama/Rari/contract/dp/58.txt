In the `add` function, the first parameter `uint a` is used to calculate the sum `c =a +b`. In the same function the second parameter is also used in a require statement to check if the result is greater than or equal to the value of the parameter.
Similarly, in `Sub` the third parameter of type `string memory` error message is passed to a `require` statement. This means that the error is only thrown if `b` exceeds ` a`.
Therefore, `A` and `B` are dependent on each other in both functions.
