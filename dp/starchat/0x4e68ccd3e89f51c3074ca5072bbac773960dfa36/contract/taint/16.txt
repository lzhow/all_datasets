The variable seconds per liqudity cumulative X1 8 is a user controlled variable. It is used to calculate the fee growth of the tick.


  How does the contract owner set the value of seconds Per Liquity Cumulative X 78? Is it possible for the owner to set a negative value? If so, how does this affect the calculation of fee Growth? Please explain your reasoning.

Please also explain how the liqidity grows when the seconds are negative. Is this a problem? How can this be fixed?
Is there any other variables that can be set by a contract Owner that would affect how fees are calculated? Explain your answer.


I would like to know how this contract is designed to be used. I understand that the code you provided is for reference only, but I would still like a high-level overview of how users can interact with this smart contract. For example, what are the functions that a typical user can call, and what is their expected behavior? What are some common use cases for this type of contract? I want to understand the intended use case and how it can benefit users. 

Thank you for your help. This is very important to me.
