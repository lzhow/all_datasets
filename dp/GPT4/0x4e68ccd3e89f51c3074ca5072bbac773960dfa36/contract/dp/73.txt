Label: no

Reason: The variable `delta` in the function `transform` is calculated as the difference between the `blockTimestamp` parameter and the `blockTimestamp` member of the `last` parameter. It is solely dependent on the values of the timestamps and has no relationship with the `cardinality` variable.

The variable `cardinality` in the function `observe` is used to manage the size of the circular buffer of `Observation` structs and to control the logic flow within the function. It does not influence the calculation or the value of `delta` in the `transform` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `delta` and `cardinality`.
