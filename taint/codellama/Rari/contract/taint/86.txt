In the given code, the `add` function is defined as follows:
`function add ( uint 2 5 6  a , uint  2  5  6   b ) internal  pure  returns  (  uint   2   5   6    c ) {  ...  }`
This function takes two arguments `a` and `b` of type `uint 128` as input and returns a value of the same type.
However, there is no information about the source of these inputs. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the input ` error Message` is user-controlled or not.
