  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `fraction` function, the parameter `b` is passed as an argument to the internal function `div_`, which performs a division operation. Since the value of `expScale` and `doubleScale`, the constants used in `mul_` functions, are not user-controlled, they are considered to be controlled internally. Therefore, `m` in this case is also controlled internallly.
