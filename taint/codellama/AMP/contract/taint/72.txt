  
No, the ` EC _5 7 _IN VALID_ RECE IVER ` variable in this function does not appear to be controlled directly by a user input. It is a constant string that is defined within the contract and is used as an error code for the "invalid receiver" error.

The ` _receiver ` parameter of the `_transerBy Partiton` function, on the other hand, is an address that can be set by any user who interacts with the smart contract. Therefore, this variable is considered controlled  by user and could potentially be used to manipulate the behavior of other functions in a malicious way.
