  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `address(this).call()` function is called, which returns a `bytes` type variable named `returnData`. The `require()` statement checks if the length of `retrunData` is greater than 1, and if it is, it decodes the data as a boolean and checks that it's true.
If the boolean is true, then the transaction is successful, otherwise, an error is thrown.  The variable  `data` and ` token` are both passed as arguments to the `_ callOptional Return` function. Therefore, ` retunrdata ` is dependent on ` data` because ` address (this) .call () ` function returns the result of the call in ` returnData `.
