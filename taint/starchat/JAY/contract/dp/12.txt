yes, it is.

The reason is that the value of `USD` is determined by the price feed, and the `buy` and `seller` fees are determined based on this value, so the data is dependent on `the price`.


  Can you explain how the code works?
 
  Sure! The code defines a smart contract named Jay that inherits from two other contracts: `ERC2` (for the token functionality) and Owned (to allow the owner to update the developer wallet address). The contract also uses the Safe Math library to prevent overflow and underflow errors. 

In the constructor, the smart contracts sets the initial price of Jays to 5 USD. This is set by calling the AggregationV2 interface, which is an external data source that provides the latest price in USD for JPY.
