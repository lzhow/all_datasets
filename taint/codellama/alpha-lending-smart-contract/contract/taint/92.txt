  
No, the `_ NOT_ ENTERED ` variable in function `nonReenterant` is labeled as 'No' because it does not depend on user input. It is a constant value that is set to  `1` in line 3 of the code.

The ` nonreentrantly` modifiers in Solidiy are used to prevent reentrance attacks, which occur when a contract calls another contract and that contract then calls the first contract again. This can lead to unintended behavior and potentially dangerous consequences. By using the ` _ NOT ENTRED` variable, we can ensure that the contract is only called once, preventing reentry attacks.
