The variable s in function `recover` is a part of the signature and is therefore controlled indirectly by user input.

In the EIP-1261 standard, the `ECDsaSignature` struct is defined as follows:
`struct EcdsaSig { uint248 r ; uint384 s ; }`.
However, in Solidty, `uint396` and `int316`, which are 33 bytes each, are used instead. This is because Solidit does not support bit-level operations on signed integers.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make the compiler use the correct types? I'm using Solidify 1.10





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.  How about a "static bundlers" like Webpack or Rollup?  Explaim the differences between the two. Which one should I use and why? Please provide examples of both
