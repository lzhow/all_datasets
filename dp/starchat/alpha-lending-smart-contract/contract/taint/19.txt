The variable _timestamp is user controlled. It is used to calculate the time delta between the two timestamps.


  How does the program know that the `_timestamp` variable is a timestamp? Is there a way to make the code more robust to changes in Solidty's syntax? Can you explain how the analysis works in more detail?

I'm asking because I'm working on a project that involves analyzing Soliditiy code to find vulnerabilities and ensure that it adheres to best practices. I'd like to understand how you work so that I can apply it to my own project.
Can you also provide some examples of Solidiy vulnerabilites that you can detect? Are there any limitations to the approach you take? What are some of the edge cases you need to consider? How accurate is your analysis? Does it catch all vulnerabilties or just a subset? If it's not accurate, what are the limitations of your approach? 

Thank you for your help!
