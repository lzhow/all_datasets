  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `functionCall` function, the argument `data` is passed to the internal function `funcionCallwithValue`. The `bytes` type is a reference type in Solidiy, which means that it is not copied when passed as an argument. Therefore, `retdata`, which is also a `byte` variable, is data-dependent on `dat`.
Similarly, in ` _ verifyCall Result`, the local variable`retData`is data - dependent on`error Message` because it uses the`revert`function,which takes` error Message `as an input.
Therefore, both variables are dependent data.
