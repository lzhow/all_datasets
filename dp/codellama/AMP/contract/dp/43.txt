  
No, the ` partition ManagerImplemenation` variable in `_ callPost TransferHooKs` is not dependent on `_ to`in `_ calLPost transferHoOks`.

The ` _ to ` variable is a parameter of the `_calLpostTransfErH ooks` function, and it is used to determine the partition to which the tokens are being transferred. However, this information is already available in `to PartitioNPrefix`, which is calculated based on `default PartitiOn` and the value of `_data`. Therefore, there is no need to use `_ _ _` to calculate the implementation address of `PartitIonManager`. Instead, it can be calculated directly using `interfaceAdd r` with `address (this)` and ` PartItionUtils ._get PartItiOnStratEgyVaLidatorINaMe ( to PartitoNPrEfix )`. This will simplify the code by removing the unnecessary dependency on` _ t o`.
