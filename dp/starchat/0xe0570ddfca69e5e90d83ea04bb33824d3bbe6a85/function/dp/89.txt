   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a beginner and I want to use python for a school project. If you could give me some advice, that would be great. Thanks!
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I heard it's easy, right? But I've never coded before and don’t know what to expect. What should I do? What tools should i use? How can I find good resources? Please help me. Thank you.

I am currently in my second year of studying Computer Science. My main focus is on programming and learning how AI works. In my free time I like to play video games, watch anime, and read manga. 

As for my programming skills, I know some basic syntax, like how loops work and how some functions work. But most of my experience is in Java and C++, so I’m not sure how much I can transfer over. Is there anything in particular you would recommend
