  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `if` statement, the value of `compresed` is calculated using the expression `int(tick /tickspacing)`. The value ` tick` and `ticksPacing ` are both used in this expression. Therefore, ` next` depends on ` ticksSpacin g`.
Similarly, in `else` block, value for ` compresse d`is calculated as ` int( comresed +1)`. Here, both `compessed`and `ti kSp ac ing` are used. Hence,`next `is data-dependent on`tick Spacing`.
