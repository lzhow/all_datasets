In the ` functionfunctionCallwithValue` function, the` data` variable is passed as an argument to the low level call function. This means that the value of ` data ` is dependent on ` retdata `, as it is used as input to a lowlevel function call.
Similarly, in `  functionstaticCall`, the  `dat`a variable  is also passed to  thelow- level function  call, which means it  depends on  ret data.
