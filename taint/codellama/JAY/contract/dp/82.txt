  
No, the variables ` amount` and ` value` are independent.

The variable amount is a local variable in function  `buyerc 751` that is not dependent on any other variable. On the other hand, variable  value is an argument of the ` J A Y to E T H` function, which is also a function. Therefore, it is independent of other variables.
