  
No, the `_ status` variable in this function `nonReenterant` is a private variable that is used to track the reentrance status of the contract. It is set to `_NOT ENTERED` in constructor and is updated to ` _ ENtered` when the `require` statement is executed. This variable is internal to this contract and cannot be controlled directly by a user, so the answer is 'No'.
