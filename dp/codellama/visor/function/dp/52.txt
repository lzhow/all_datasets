In the `SaferDecreasAllowence` function, the value of ` newAllownce` is calculated by subtracting `value` from the current allowence of the token, which is obtained by calling the allow function of IErc2O token with the address of this contract and the spendee address as arguments.
Therefore, ` token` and `spender` are both data-dependent on ` value` because they both depend on it to calculate their values.
