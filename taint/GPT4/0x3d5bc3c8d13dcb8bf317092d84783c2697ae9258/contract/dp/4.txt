Label: no

Reason: In the function `_setPendingAdmin`, the contract state `admin` is not modified or assigned any value based on the variable `newPendingAdmin`. The only operation performed with `newPendingAdmin` is to assign it to the contract state `pendingAdmin`. The `admin` state is only used in a comparison to check if the `msg.sender` is the current `admin`, which is a control flow dependency, not a data dependency. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `admin` and `newPendingAdmin` within the `_setPendingAdmin` function.
