No, the variable `compAccrued_` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `src` in the function `flywheelPreTransferAction`. 

The reason is that there is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `src` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
