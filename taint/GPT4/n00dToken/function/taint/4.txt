Label: No

Reason: The variable `_defaultOperatorsArray` is set during the deployment of the contract and is not modified by any function that allows for arbitrary user control. It is initialized in the constructor of the `ERC777` contract and is only set once. The constructor does not provide a mechanism for users to modify this array after the contract has been deployed. Therefore, `_defaultOperatorsArray` is not controlled by the user.
