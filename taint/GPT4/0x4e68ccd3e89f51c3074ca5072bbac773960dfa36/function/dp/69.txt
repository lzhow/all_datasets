Label: no

Reason: The variable `secondsPerLiquidityOutsideLowerX128` in the function `snapshotCumulativesInside` is a local variable that is assigned a value from the `ticks` mapping based on the `tickLower` index. It is used to calculate the return values within the scope of the `snapshotCumulativesInside` function.

On the other hand, the variable `step` in the function `swap` is a local struct instance of `StepComputations` used within the `swap` function to perform calculations related to the swap operation. The `step` variable is used to store intermediate values during the swap calculation and does not interact with the `snapshotCumulativesInside` function or its variables.

Since `secondsPerLiquidityOutsideLowerX128` and `step` are local to their respective functions and there is no shared state or cross-function interaction that would create a data dependency between them, they are not data dependent.
