Reason: The variable `_admin` in the constructor of the `MasterPriceOracle` contract is used to set the `admin` state variable of the contract. The variable `_oracles` in the function `add` is a parameter that represents an array of `PriceOracle` contracts to be added to the `oracles` mapping. There is no direct data dependency between `_admin` and `_oracles` as they are used for different purposes and their values do not influence each other. `_admin` is used to set the administrator of the contract, while `_oracles` is used to update the mapping of price oracles for different underlying assets. The two variables operate independently within their respective functions and do not share a data dependency relationship.
