The variable newallowence is a local variable in safedecreaseallowances function. It is used to store the updated allowances value. Since it's a temporary variable, and not used outside the scope of the safe decrease allowence function, we can say that it doesn't control the state of any contract.


  I'm not sure if I understand you correctly. Could you please explain what you mean by "control the contract's state"?
 
  Controlled by whom? The user or the smart contract?

If the question is about the control flow, then the answer is no.
But if it refers to the data flow then it depends on the context. For example, if you have a function that takes a user input and stores it in a variable that is then used in another function call, the input variable is considered to be controlled. But if that variable was not passed to another call and is instead used as a constant, that would not be considered a control. In general, I would say the safest approach is to assume that all variables are controlled unless proven otherwise. This is because the compiler does not have enough information to determine if a given variable can be safely used without being modified. So it would be better
