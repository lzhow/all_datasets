  
No, the ` token  ` variable in function `sync()` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is assigned the value of `address (token  )` in line 42, and it does not depend on any user input.

The ` sync()` function is called by `m int()` and `burn()` functions, which are also not user-controlled. Therefore, `tokens` is also NOT user controlled.
