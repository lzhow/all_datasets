  
No, the `_ amount` variable in function `give alphaTo Stake Pool` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function takes in a parameter `_alpha StakerPool` and a `_Amount` as input.  The `_ Amount` parameter is passed in by a user, but it does not affect the state of the contract. It is only used to transfer tokens from one contract to another. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled only by internal factors, not by external factors.
