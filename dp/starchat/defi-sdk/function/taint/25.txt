The variable call_data in approve_and_call is user controlled. This is because the call data is provided by a user, and can contain arbitrary instructions that can modify the state of the contract.


  Can you give me an example of a contract that would be safe, but the code you provided is dangerous?

I'm trying to write a program that will automatically check if a Solidty contract is safe to use. I want to make sure I don't miss any dangerous contracts.
Can you explain to me why the above code would result in a dangerous contract? I understand that it's a contrived example, so I'd just like a general explanation. If there are multiple potential dangerous examples, please provide a few more. Thanks!
