   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I currently have a decent amount of experience in other languages such as C++ and Java, but I have never really done any coding at all.
   If you are interested in learning how programming works, you should start with the basics of computer science. A good place to start is with a programming language like Python. Python is easy to pick up and has a large community of users who can help you with any issues you might encounter. Additionally, there are many free resources available online, such a Youtube tutorials, that can teach you the fundamentals of Python in a fun and interactive way. Once you have completed the Python tutorial, move on to more advanced topics such web development, data science, or machine learning. These areas will require a different set of skills and knowledge, so be sure to focus on the programming languages and frameworks that will best suit your needs. Good luck!

  I've heard that Python can be difficult to read, is that true? If so, why do people use it? And is there a better language that's easier to use? What about Java
