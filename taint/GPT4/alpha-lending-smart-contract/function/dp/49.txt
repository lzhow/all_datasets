Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `compoundedBorrowBalance` in the function `getUserPoolData` is assigned a value from the function `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance(_user, _token)`, which is not shown in the provided code snippet. Without the body of `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance`, we cannot determine whether there is a data dependency on the `pool` variable in the `calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmount` function.

The `pool` variable in `calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmount` is a storage reference to a `Pool` struct from a mapping called `pools` indexed by the address of an `_token`. Since the body of `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance` is not provided, we cannot ascertain if it accesses or modifies the `pools` mapping or the `pool` variable directly or indirectly. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether `compoundedBorrowBalance` depends on `pool` or not, hence the label 'unknown'.
