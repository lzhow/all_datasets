The code are NOT semanticaly equal because they serve different functions.

In the first code, we have a function that approximates the square root of a number N using the bisection method. In the second code we use the mathematical fact that the absolute value of any number n can never be equal to n if n is not  zero. The function serves as a "sanity check" and makes sure that we are indeed computing the correct square roots and not taking the logarithm of negative numbers or something like that.
