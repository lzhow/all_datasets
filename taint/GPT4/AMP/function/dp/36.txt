The answer is no.

In the `_calPretransferHooks` function, the `senderImplemenation` variable is assigned the value of the address of `AMP_TOKENS_SENER`. This contract does not have any functions or state variables that are called `to`.
However, in `_postTransferHook` the recipient implementation is called on `_from`. Since `_value` is a parameter to this function and `_data` and `operator_data`, which are also parameters, are used in both functions, it is possible that the values of `_operator` or `_partition` could be changed between the two calls, which could cause the functions to behave incorrectly.


  How can I prove that this is not the case?
 
  You can prove this by showing that there is some path in your code where the variables are changed in such a way that they no longer satisfy the conditions of data dependence. This could include changing the state of a contract, calling a function that changes the contract's state, or modifying the memory of another function. If you can show that such changes can occur, then you have proven that data dependencies exist between these variables. However, if you cannot show such behavior, you may
