  
No, the variables ` recipentImplemenation` and `_ to Partion` are independent.

The variable` recipienImlementation ` is assigned the result of the `interfaceAddrs` function, which takes two arguments: the address of a contract and a string. In this case, it is called with the `_ _ to` variable as the first argument and the string "AMP Tokens Recipent" as its second argument. This means that the value of `recepient Implementation ` depends on `_ __ to`, but it does not depend on` _ _ __ _ Partiton`.
