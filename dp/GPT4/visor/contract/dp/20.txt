The contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `burn`. This is because the `burn` function modifies the `_balances` mapping by subtracting the `amount` from the balance of the `account` specified. The relevant line in the `burn` function is:

```solidity
_balances[account] = _balances[account].sub(amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance");
```

Here, the `.sub` function from the `SafeMath` library is used to safely subtract the `amount` from the current balance of the `account` in `_balances`. If the subtraction is successful, the new balance is updated in the `_balances` mapping, establishing a direct data dependency between `_balances` and `amount`.
