   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
   
    An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web pages by combining multiple files into a single file. These files are then served to users as a smaller number of files, reducing the number and size of requests made to servers.

    There are several incremental bundle tools available for use in web development. Some of these tools include:

    - Webpack
    - Rollup
    These tools work by analyzing the dependencies between the files in a project and generating a graph of how these files relate to each other. They then use this information to generate an optimized bundle of all the project files. Tools like Webpack allow developers to configure how they want the bundles to be generated
