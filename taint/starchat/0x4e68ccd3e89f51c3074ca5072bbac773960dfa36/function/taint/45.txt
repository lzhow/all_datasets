The variable self in function `update` is a struct type and is declared as a storage variable in a mapping. Since mappings are not supported in inline assembly, the compiler cannot track the changes made to the struct members. Hence, `mapping(address => mapping())` cannot be used as the storage type for `struct Info`.

To solve this issue, you can use a different data structure such as an array or a tuple to store the information. Alternatively, if you are using Solidty version 8 or above, a new data type called `StorageReference` can be introduced to solve the issue.


  Can you give me an example of how to use the array datastructure instead? I'm not sure how that would look like in Solidiy. Can I just replace the mapping with an Array? And how would I do that? Can't believe I've never done that before. I feel like an idiot. But I really need to get this right. Thanks in advance!
