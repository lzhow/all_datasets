The variable pendingowner_ is a contract variable that is set by calling the setpendingowner function. This function is only callable by an owner, and the owner is passed as a parameter to the constructor. Therefore, the only way to set the pending Owner is through the contract constructor, which is therefore the place where the control flow of the program is established.
