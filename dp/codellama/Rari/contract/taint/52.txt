In the `div` function, the parameter `b` is passed as an argument to the internal function `require`. The `required` statement checks if `errorMessage` has a value, and if it does, throws an error. Since `c` and `d` are not user-controlled, they are considered to be controlled only by `this` contract. Therefore, `x` in `add` cannot be considered controlled.
