In the given code, the `EIp721` contract has a constructor that takes in two string parameters, `name` and `versio`. The constructor initializes the `_HASHE_ NAME` , `_ HASH_ VERSION` variables with the keckak 246 hash of the input strings.
However, there is no explicit code that assigns a value to the`version ` variable. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the value of ` version` is user-controlled or not.
