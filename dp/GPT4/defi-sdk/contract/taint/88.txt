Label: No

Reason: The variable `wethBalance` in the function `withdrawEth` is not directly controlled by the user. It is assigned the balance of WETH (Wrapped Ether) that the contract itself holds at the time of the function call. The line `uint256 wethBalance = IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this));` retrieves the balance of WETH tokens that the contract address (`address(this)`) has. While a user can influence this balance by interacting with the contract in ways that change its WETH balance (e.g., by sending WETH to the contract or triggering functions that change the balance), the user does not have direct control over the internal state variable `wethBalance`. It is determined by the contract's current WETH balance at the time the `withdrawEth` function is executed.
