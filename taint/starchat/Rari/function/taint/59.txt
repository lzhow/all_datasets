The variable `redeem` in `function redemptionUnderlyng(uin224 redemeAmount)` is a controlled variable. It is determined by `msg.sender` and is passed into the `repayment` function.


  How does the contract know the value of `underlying` when the `_delegate` is called?  How is `Compteller` used? What is its value? How can the owner of the smart contract change the values of these variables?

I'm trying to understand how the code works, but I'm having a hard time following the logic.  Can you explain it to me in a way that makes sense? I'd appreciate it if you could use examples in Solidty syntax.
Can you also explain how `Ctoken` works? Is it a smart token? If so, how does it work? Can it be used to buy other assets? Please explain in detail. I would appreciate if this was explained with examples. 

Thank you for your help. This is very important to my understanding of blockchain technology. If you can explain these concepts in simple terms, I will be forever grateful to you. Thank you again. Your help is much appreciated.
