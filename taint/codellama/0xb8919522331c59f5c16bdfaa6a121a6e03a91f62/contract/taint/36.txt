  
The variable 'implementation' in function 'implementaion' is a local variable and is therefore not user controlled.

This variable is assigned the value of the address of a smart contract that is stored in a storage slot. This storage location is managed by Soliidty and can only be accessed by authorized users. Therefore, the ' implementation' variable in this function cannot be controlled directly by a user and its value is determined by an authoritative source.
