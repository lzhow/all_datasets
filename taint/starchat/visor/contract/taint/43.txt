The variable a in function `add` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a can be influenced by other variables and functions in smart contract. For example, if a is used in a mathematical operation, then the result of that operation can affect the final value assigned to a. Therefore, in general, we cannot say for sure whether a variable is directly controlled or not.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract and their corresponding labels?  Also, can you explain how the labels are determined?

Can you also give an example of how a contract could be classified as "yes", "no", or "unknown"?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problems for weeks on end. I also want to do this for a living. please help




I would recommend the official Python documentation, which can always be found at https://docs.python.org/3/. It is very well written and covers a lot of ground regarding Python.
