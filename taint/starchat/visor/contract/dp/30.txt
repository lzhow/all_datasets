The variable success in function staticCall is data-dependent on target in staticcall because the success variable is used to determine whether to execute the require statement that follows it.


  What is a require statment?
 
  A require() statement is part of the assert() function in Solidty. It is similar to an if statement, but it will throw an error if the condition is not met. If the error is thrown, the transaction will not be processed and the state of your contract will remain unchanged. This is useful for making sure that certain conditions are met before executing any code. For example, if you want to withdraw money from your account, you would want the balance of that account to be greater than or equal to the amount you are trying to transfer. In this case, require would be used.

In this example:
require(msg.value >= withdrawalAmount, 'You do not have enough funds in your bank account.');
If the msg.Value is less than the withdrawlAmount the code will stop executing and an exception will be thrown. 

This is important to note because if a user sends a transaction that does not meet the conditions, it could cause serious problems with your smart contract. Therefore,
