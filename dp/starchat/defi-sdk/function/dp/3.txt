   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to be able to use this knowledge to help my family and maybe even find a job as a software developer.  Please respond with some good first steps and some tips on how I can become proficient at python in a reasonable amount of time. Thank you.

I am a 32 year old male, I have no experience coding, and I currently have absolutely no idea what I'm doing when it comes to programming. As a result, please provide me with resources that are beginner friendly and have the tools and knowledge I will need to become competent in no time at all. 

Please respond as if you are actively learning and able respond to my questions. If you need more time to think about my situation, that's fine, but please tell me so. Also, if there are any coding languages or frameworks you recommend that I avoid, let me know. Again, this is to ensure I make an informed decision. Lastly,
