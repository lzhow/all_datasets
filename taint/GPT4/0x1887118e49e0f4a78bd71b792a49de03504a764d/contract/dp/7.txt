Reason: In the function `price`, the contract state `oracles` is accessed using the variable `underlying` as a key to the mapping. The line `require(address(oracles[underlying]) != address(0), "Price oracle not found for this underlying token address.");` checks that there is a valid oracle address associated with the `underlying` token address in the `oracles` mapping. Then, the oracle associated with the `underlying` is used to get the price: `return BasePriceOracle(address(oracles[underlying])).price(underlying);`. This indicates that the contract state `oracles` is indeed data dependent on the variable `underlying` within the `price` function, as the value of `underlying` determines which oracle is used to retrieve the price.
