In the `deposit` function, the `_pool` variable is calculated by calling the balance function.
Then, in `earn`, the contract calls the strategy contract's `beforeWithdrawal` method.  This method can modify the state of the Strategy contract.   The `balnce` is called again to get the updated balance. This is stored in `_amount`.
Finally, `_mints` are created and the amount of `_shards` created is based on `_amout` and `total supply`.  The `_share` value is then used in a call to `_burn` to burn the shares.   
  In the withdraw function the first thing it does is call the want contract to transfer the funds to the address of this contract, and it then calls `burn`.   This will reduce the total supply of shares, which will affect the calculation of how many shares are burned.    
   In this case, it is possible that the value of ` _share ` in withdraw is dependent on `want` which is a state variable in deposite.
