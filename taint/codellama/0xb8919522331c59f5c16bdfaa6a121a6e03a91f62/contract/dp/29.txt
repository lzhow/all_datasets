In the `TranspareUpgrdeableproxy.sol` contract, the `_getImplentation()` function returns the address of the implementation contract. This function calls the staticcall function on `address.calldataload(4)` which is equal to `0xc0`. This is a constant value that is used to retrieve the value of a storage slot. In this case, it is retrieving the storage value at the slot `keccak22(abi.encodetype(uint29), 1)` (which is `bytes4(kecckak(type(Proxy).creationCode).keckack(1))`). This storage location is set in `ER186Upgade.slo` and is where the proxy contract stores the current implementation address.
Therefore, ` retuendata ` is data-dependent on` proxy` because it retrieves the data from the contract's storage.
