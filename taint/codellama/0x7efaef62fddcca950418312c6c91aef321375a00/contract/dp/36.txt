  
No, the `mbalancesOf ` contract is not dependent on `_ reserves0`. The `_ mintsF` function only uses the `_ reserve  ` variable to calculate the liquidty minted, and the balance of the token is only used to update the total supply of tokens.

The reason is that the minting function is called after the transfer of funds from the caller to the pair contract, so the updated balance is already reflected in ` balanceof`.
Additionally, ` _ minsF ` function does not use the current balance to determine the amount of liquidities to mint, it uses a fixed formula to compute the number of liqudities based on `reserves` and `total supply`. Therefore, there is no need to use ` balances` to get the latest balance.
