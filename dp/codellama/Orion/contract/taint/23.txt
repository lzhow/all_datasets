  
The variable curbal is a local variable in function `_doSwaopTokes`. It is initialized to the balance of the token at the address `initialtransfersource` before the transfer is made. It can be controlled or not by user depends on the value of `supportFfee` and the `amountin` variable.

If `suppportingfe` is true, then the amount of tokens transferred is equal to `IErc2.0 (input) .balancOf (initial transfer source)` minus ` cur balance`. This means that the cur bal can only be changed by a transfer of input tokens to initial transfer address. Therefore, the current balance is under the control of user if `input` token is also under user control.  If `suporttingfees`is false, ` amountin ` is used to calculate the new balance. This can also be under control by users if they have control over the input token. In this case, both ` input`and ` initialtransfersource` are under users control, and `currentbal` can therefore be considered under their control as well. However, if only `initaltransfsersource `is underuser control and not `inpout`, then ` currentbal ` can still be influenced by other users.
