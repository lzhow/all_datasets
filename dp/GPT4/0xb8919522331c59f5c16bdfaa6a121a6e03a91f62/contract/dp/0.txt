Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the code size of the address `account` passed to the function. It is assigned a value based on the result of the `extcodesize` operation on the `account` address. On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` is an address on which a static call is performed. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the `size` variable and the `target` variable within the scope of their respective functions. The `size` variable is local to the `isContract` function and is not influenced by, nor does it influence, the `target` variable in the `functionStaticCall` function. Each function operates independently, and their local variables do not interact with each other.
