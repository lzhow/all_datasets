Reason: The variable `tickCumulative` in the function `_updatePosition` is used to store the cumulative tick value at a specific point in time, which is obtained from the `observations.observeSingle` function call. This value is used within the `_updatePosition` function to update the state of the position and is not influenced by external variables outside of its scope.

On the other hand, the variable `delta` in the function `swap` is a local variable used to calculate a portion of the fee amount that is to be subtracted based on the `feeProtocol`. The `delta` variable is used within the `swap` function to adjust the fee amount and protocol fee, and it does not interact with or influence the `tickCumulative` variable in the `_updatePosition` function.

Since there is no code path where `delta` affects the value of `tickCumulative`, there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables.
