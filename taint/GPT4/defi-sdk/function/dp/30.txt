The variable `amount` in the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount` is directly assigned from the `tokenAmount.amount` field, which is a property of the `tokenAmount` parameter passed to the function. This establishes a direct data dependency relationship between `amount` and `tokenAmount`, as the value of `amount` is determined by the value of `tokenAmount.amount`.
