Label: no

Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the code size of the address `account` that is passed to the function. It is assigned a value based on the result of the `extcodesize` operation on the `account` address. On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionCall` represents the address of the contract being called. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `size` and `target` within the scope of their respective functions. The value of `size` is determined independently of the value of `target`, and vice versa. Each function operates in isolation with respect to these variables, and the value of one does not influence or depend on the value of the other within the given code context.
