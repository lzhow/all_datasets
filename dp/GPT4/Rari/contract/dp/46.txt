Explanation: The contract state `dripped` is data dependent on the variable `dripTotal_` in the function `drip`. This can be seen from the line `uint drippedNext_ = add(dripped_, toDrip_, "tautological");` where the value of `dripped_` is used to calculate the new value of `drippedNext_` by adding `toDrip_`. Since `toDrip_` is calculated based on the value of `dripTotal_`, any change in `dripTotal_` will affect the value of `drippedNext_` and consequently the contract state `dripped`.
