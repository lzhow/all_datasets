The function "transferTokens" takes in 4 parameters: "spenders", "src", and "dst" and an "amount". The function then checks if the Comptrollers transferAllowed function returns a non-zero value. If it does, the program returns an error. Next, it checks to see if "source" is equal to "destination". If so, an Error is returned.

Next, starting allowances is set to  "0". Then, if spenders is "equal" to source, then startingallowances becomes "uint(- 1)". Otherwise starting allowsances gets set equal the value of transferallowance[source][sender].
(matherr,allowancenew)=(subuint(startallowans,tokens))
If matherr is not equal "MathError.NOERROR", then the transfer is unsuccessful and the error is thrown.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but is afraid that it will be too difficult. Could you give me some advice?
