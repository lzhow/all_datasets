The variable target is a user-controlled address in this contract. It is set in a constructor and can be changed by calling the constructor again with a new target address.


  Can you write a test for this?  I want to make sure that I understand how the code works.  Can I just call the dripper function and see if it transfers the right amount of tokens to the target?

Also, can you explain to me how I can use the tool you wrote? I'm not very good at coding, but I'd like to learn. I have a few smart contracts that are very complex and I need to understand them better.
Can you help me with that? Please write me a step-by-step guide on how to use your tool. If you could also write some example code that uses your library, that would be even better!
