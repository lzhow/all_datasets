Label: no

Reason: The contract state `expScale` is not present in the provided Solidity contract code, and therefore it cannot have a data dependency relationship with the variable `blockNumber` in the function `updateContributorRewards`. The function `updateContributorRewards` updates the rewards for a contributor based on the number of blocks that have passed since the last update and the contributor's speed, but it does not reference or depend on a state variable named `expScale`. Since `expScale` is not part of the contract's state variables or used within the function in question, there is no data dependency between `expScale` and `blockNumber`.
