  
The variable call data is a bytes type variable in function `approve and call` in contract `SimpleCall` . It is passed as an argument to the `function call with value` function in `Address` library. This function is used to make a call to another contract with a specified amount of Ether.

Since the call is made with the value of the input token, the amount is determined by `Base` contract. Therefore, `amount` is also controlled.
