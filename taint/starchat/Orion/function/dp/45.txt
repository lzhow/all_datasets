   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all the time because I keep making mistakes and the code does not work. I want to create something useful instead of just following tutorials. What should I do? I have heard that you only need to focus on one thing at a time and to keep practicing. Is that really true? How do I know when I'm ready? What are some good ways to stay motivated? Please help me and give me some tips on how I can learn to program in Python. Thank you.

I am a 26 year old male, I was born in Germany and I currently live in Switzerland. My first language is German. In my free time I like to go for a walk, to read a book or listen to music. If you need anything else, just ask.
