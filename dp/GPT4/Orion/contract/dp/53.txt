The variable `toAuto` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is assigned the value of `address(this)` or `swapData.to` based on the condition `isLastWETH || swapData.curFactoryType == FactoryType.CURVE`. 

The variable `reserveOutput` in the function `_swap` is used to calculate the `amountOut` and is passed as an argument to the `pair.swap` function.

There is no direct assignment or calculation between the two variables. Therefore, it is not clear if there is a data dependency relationship between `toAuto` and `reserveOutput`.
