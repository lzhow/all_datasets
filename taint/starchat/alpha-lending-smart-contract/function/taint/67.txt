An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to the server during development. It does this by bundl ingtogether all the files that are required to run a web page into a single file that can be served to a user's browser. This makes it easier for the browser to load the page and render it to users, as it only needs to make a request for a small numberof files rather than a large number. An incremental bundle is created by watching the filesystem for changes to files, and bunding only the changed files into the final bundle. When a change is detected, only that file is re-bundled, ratherthan the entire application. Incremental bundlers are commonly used in
