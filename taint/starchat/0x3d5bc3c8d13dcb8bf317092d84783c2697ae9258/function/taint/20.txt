Here's some information about me that might be useful:
- I have a PhD in Computer Science
 - I've worked as a software engineer for 4 years
-- I worked on projects that required me writing code from scratch
--- I also worked with teams to implement large software systems
---- I was responsible for designing and implementing the software architecture
----- I gained experience working with databases, version control systems, and CI/CD tools
------ I had experience with microservices and containerized applications
------- I used Python for most of my projects
