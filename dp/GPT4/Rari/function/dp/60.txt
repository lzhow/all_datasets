No, the variable `mintAmount` in the function `mintAllowed` is not data dependent on the variable `assets` in the function `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternal`.

Explanation: 
In the function `mintAllowed`, the variable `mintAmount` is used to calculate `nextTotalUnderlyingSupply`, which is then compared with `supplyCap`. There is no direct or indirect reference to the variable `assets` in this calculation.

Therefore, there is no data dependency between `mintAmount` and `assets`.
