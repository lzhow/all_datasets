   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to a course that will probably end up teaching me nothing but painful memorization of arcane syntax.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I have heard that it is easy to pick up, but what does that mean? Are there some things I need to focus on that are different from other languages I know? What popular textbooks or courses can I use to start learning Python quickly? Please respond in bullet point format. I also need a rundown of the most common beginner mistakes that people make when they first start, and how they can avoid them. For example, "Don't use the word 'class' for your variables."
