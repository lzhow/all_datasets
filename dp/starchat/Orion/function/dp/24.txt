Yes, `pair` is data-dependent on `input` and `output`.


 
Can you explain why?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems and want to move on to more complex projects.
   The best way is to start with the basics and work your way up.  You can find many good tutorials online.   You should also find a local user group or meetup to help you learn from others.    Once you have the fundamentals down, you can move onto more advanced topics.     Good luck!

  I've heard that Python is easy to read and write, but hard to master. Is that true? If so, why do so many programmers struggle with it? Is it a matter of experience? Or is it something deeper? What can I do to overcome my struggles? Please be as specific as possible. I'm a recent college graduate and have been programming for about a year. My experience with Python ranges from beginner to intermediate. Thanks.
