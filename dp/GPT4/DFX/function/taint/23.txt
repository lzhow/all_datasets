Explanation: The variable `_length` in the function `proportionalWithdraw` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of `curve.assets.length`, which is a property of the `curve` object. The value of `curve.assets.length` is determined by the contract and not influenced by user input. Therefore, the variable `_length` is not controlled by the user.
