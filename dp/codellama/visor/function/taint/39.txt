  
The variable 'newowner' in function 'transfoerOwership' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the new owner is set by a user input.

In the code, the 'owner ' variable is assigned to the address of the sender of a transaction. This means that only the current owner of this contract can transfer ownership to a new address. Therefore, only a trusted user can set the value of ' newowner'.
