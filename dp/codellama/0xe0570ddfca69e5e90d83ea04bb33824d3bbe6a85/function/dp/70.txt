  
No, the state variable `_entered` is not dependent on ` r` because it is a local variable and is only used in a conditional statement. It is also not used to calculate the value of `b` or `want()`. Therefore, it does not affect the data flow of the program.

The data dependence relationship between ` _enter` and ` b` can be determined by analyzing the code. In this case, `  _ enter` does depend on  `bal`  because ` bal` affects the conditional expression in which `enter ` is used. However, this does  not mean that ` enter ` depends on any other variable.
