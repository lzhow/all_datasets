  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. How does it work? Explain it to me at a level a novice could understand.
  3. Why would I want to use one? Give me some use cases.

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers for short is used to optimize the performance of web application. It is commonly used in development to improve the speed of page loads and reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent to the user. An incremental bundle only includes the changes made to a web page since the last time the bundle was generated. This makes it very efficient for large web projects that take a long time to build.
