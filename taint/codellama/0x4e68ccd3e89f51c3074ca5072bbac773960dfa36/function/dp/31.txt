  
No, the variables ` flipUpper ` and ` amount Specified ` are independent.

The variable  `fipUpper ​​` is defined in function `_updatePostion` and is used to determine whether the liquidities of the ticker are flicked. It is not directly related to the `liqudity` variable in `function _swap`.
On the other hand, `amoutSpecifed`is defined and used in`function_swap` to calculate the amount of liquidty to be added or removed from the pool. However, it is also not related directly to `tick` or `ticks` variables in `_ updatePosition`.
