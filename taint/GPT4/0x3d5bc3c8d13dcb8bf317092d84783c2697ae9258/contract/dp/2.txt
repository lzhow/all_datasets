yes

In the function `_setPendingImplementation`, the contract state `pendingComptrollerImplementation` is directly assigned the value of the variable `newPendingImplementation`. This establishes a data dependency relationship between the two, as the state of `pendingComptrollerImplementation` is dependent on the value passed to `newPendingImplementation` when the function is called. Here is the relevant line of code:

```solidity
pendingComptrollerImplementation = newPendingImplementation;
```

This line shows that the value of `newPendingImplementation` is used to update the state variable `pendingComptrollerImplementation`, hence the label 'yes' for data dependency.
