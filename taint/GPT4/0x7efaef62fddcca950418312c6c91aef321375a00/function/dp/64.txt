Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `_safeTransfer`, the variable `to` is used as an argument in the `abi.encodeWithSelector` function call, which is then used as part of the data sent in the `token.call` method. The `token` variable represents the address of the token contract being interacted with, and the `call` method is used to invoke a function on that contract. The `to` variable is part of the data payload that specifies the recipient of the token transfer. Since the execution of the `token.call` depends on both the `token` contract address and the `to` address being passed correctly, there is a data dependency between `to` and `token`. The success of the token transfer, and thus the execution of the `_safeTransfer` function, is contingent upon the relationship between these two variables.
