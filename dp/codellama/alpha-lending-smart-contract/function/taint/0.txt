The variable 'latestAlphMultplier' is a mapping that maps an address to a uint 24. It is created in line 10 and is used to store the latest alpha multiplier for each address. This variable is set by calling the 'receiveAlpha' function, which is called by a trusted contract, and it does not allow any user input. Therefore, the value of 'lastestAlphaMultipler' cannot be controlled directly by any users.
