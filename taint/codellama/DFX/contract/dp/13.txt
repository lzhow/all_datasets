  
No, the `_ swapInfo ` variable in ` target Swapp` is not dependent on `_ o` variable.

The `_SwappInfo_` structure is defined in a separate library called `Swaps.Sol`, and it is used to store information about the swap operation. It is created in both `originSwapped` and `Target Swapped`, but it does not depend on any variables in those functions. Therefore, it cannot be considered data-dependent on those variables.
