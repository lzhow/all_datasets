  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `for` loop of the first `function` ` calculate Trade`, the value of `outputAmount_` is calculated based on `omega` and `psi`. The value ` prev Amount`is calculated as ` outputAmount _` before the calculation of`output Amoun t_`. Therefore, `preAmount `is data-dependent on`omega `and`psi `, which are also data dependencies of `_ oGL iq`.
