Reason: The variable `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` in the function `snapshotCumulativesInside` is calculated based on the current state of the contract, specifically the `observations` and the slot0 state, which includes the current tick, observation index, liquidity, and observation cardinality. It is used to calculate the seconds per liquidity inside a specific tick range.

On the other hand, the variable `amount1Int` in the function `burn` is a result of modifying a position's liquidity by burning a specified amount. It represents the change in token amounts due to the burn operation and is used to update the `tokensOwed1` state of a position.

There is no direct data dependency between `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` and `amount1Int` as they are calculated independently based on different inputs and serve different purposes within the contract. The former is related to the observation of the contract's state over time, while the latter is related to the adjustment of a position's liquidity and owed tokens.
