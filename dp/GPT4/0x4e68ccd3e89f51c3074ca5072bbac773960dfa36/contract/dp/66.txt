Reason: The variable `lower` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is a storage reference to a `Tick.Info` struct corresponding to the `tickLower` index in the `self` mapping. It is used to access the properties of the `Tick.Info` struct for the lower tick, such as `feeGrowthOutside0X128` and `feeGrowthOutside1X128`.

The variable `feeGrowthAbove1X128` is a local variable within the same function that is calculated based on the `tickUpper` index in the `self` mapping and the `tickCurrent` value. It represents the fee growth above the upper tick.

Since `lower` and `feeGrowthAbove1X128` are derived from different and independent entries in the `self` mapping (`tickLower` and `tickUpper`, respectively) and their values are not influenced by each other's state or calculations within the `getFeeGrowthInside` function, they do not have a data dependency relationship. The calculation of one does not affect the value or state of the other.
