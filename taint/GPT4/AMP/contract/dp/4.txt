Reason: The variable `senderImplementation` in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` is assigned a value based on the `_from` parameter, which represents the address from which tokens are being transferred. It is used to retrieve the address of the contract that implements the `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER` interface for the `_from` address. This is done through the `interfaceAddr` function call, which is independent of the `_toPartition` variable.

On the other hand, the variable `_toPartition` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` represents the partition to which tokens are being transferred. It is used to determine the partition-specific logic and to invoke hooks related to the destination partition.

Since `senderImplementation` is determined solely by the `_from` address and is not influenced by the destination partition (`_toPartition`), and `_toPartition` is used for logic related to the destination of the transfer and does not influence the sender implementation, there is no data dependency relationship between `senderImplementation` and `_toPartition`. They are used in different contexts within their respective functions and do not rely on each other's values.
