In the function `mulDiv`, the variable `result` is calculated based on the value of `prod0` and `prod1`. Specifically, `prod0` is modified based on the value of `prod1` in the following line:

```solidity
prod0 |= prod1 * twos;
```

This line of code uses the bitwise OR assignment operator (`|=`) to combine `prod0` with the result of `prod1 * twos`. The value of `prod1` directly influences the final value of `prod0`, which is then used to calculate `result` in the line:

```solidity
result = prod0 * inv;
```

Since `result` is computed using `prod0` after it has been modified by an operation involving `prod1`, there is a data dependency relationship between `result` and `prod1`. Therefore, any changes to `prod1` will affect the computation of `result`.
