Yes

The variable `proxy` in the function `getProxyAdmin` is used to perform a static call to the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract instance. The result of this call is then decoded to obtain the admin address, which is stored in the variable that is returned by the function. Therefore, the returned variable (which represents the admin address) is data dependent on the `proxy` variable because the value it holds is directly retrieved from the `proxy` contract instance.
