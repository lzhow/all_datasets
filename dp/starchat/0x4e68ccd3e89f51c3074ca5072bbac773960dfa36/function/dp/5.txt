   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all the time and not being able to apply what I have learned. I want to create something useful, but I don't know where to start. Some courses are very long and complicated, while others are too basic. What would you recommend? I also donâ€™t know what tools I should use. Should I use visual studio code with the python extension? Or should I switch to an IDE like Pycharm? Which one should i choose? And should python be my first language or should it be the last? Please help me!
   

  What are some good first projects I could do with Python? What IDE should be used? Should it just be a simple calculator or could it do more? Could it connect to a database? How could I make a GUI? Is there a website that could help with this? If so, what is it? Can you give me a list of 10 useful websites? Finally, how could a beginner make sure they have all of the necessary tools to do
