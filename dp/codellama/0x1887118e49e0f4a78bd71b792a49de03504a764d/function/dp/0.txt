  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the constructor function, the `admin` variable is assigned the value of `_admin`, and the`can AdminOverWrite`variable is set to the boolean value `_ can Admin Overwrite`. The `oracless` array is initialized with the values of the `_oracle`array, and each element of `underlying` is used as a key to access the corresponding element in `oracle`.
Because the assignment of`admin =_admin;` and ` can adminOver write = canadminoverwrite;` are performed in sequence, ` admin` and` can adminsOver Write` are dependent on` _ admin `and`_canadminOverwrites`, respectively.
Therefore, we can conclude that the state of contract `CanAdmin Over Write `is data-dependent on variable` `_Can Admin overwrit`in the construction function.
