   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python was created in  the late 80s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Van Rosson was a Dutch programmer who worked for the National Research Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science in The Netherland (NWO), and worked on new programming languages for science, number crunching and graphical user interfaces. Guidovision was one of the first Python books published, and it was later selected as the cover of both the New Yorker and the Washington Post's magazine."
