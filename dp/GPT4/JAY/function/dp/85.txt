Explanation: 

The variable `success` in the function `buyNFTs` is not directly dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `amount` in the calculation or condition related to `success`. However, there might be an indirect dependency between these variables if the `buyERC1155` function, which is called within `buyNFTs`, modifies the state of the contract in a way that affects the execution of `buyJayWithERC1155` and consequently the value of `success`. Without further information about the implementation of `buyERC1155`, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
