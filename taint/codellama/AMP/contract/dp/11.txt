  
No, the ` swap Token` contract is not dependent on `_ swap token address_`. The `Swap Token ` contract address is passed as an argument to the constructor, but it is stored in a different variable, ` _ swaptoken_`, and is used to initialize the `_Swaptoken_ ` variable.

The `total supply` of the token is also initialized in this function, and it depends on `default partition` and `granuarity`.
