   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python was created in 1989 by Guido van Rossum. He worked for the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Netherlands, and later for Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in The Netherland. Van Rossaum was a Dutch programmer, who wrote the BBC microcomputer game Boulevard Mystery, for which Python was designed as an easy-to-use language.[1] VanRossuman's goal was to create a language that was easy to read and write, as well as powerful and efficient. Python is used in a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing to artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is free and open-source software and has a large community of contributors.
 
  The best way is to start with a book or video tutorial.
