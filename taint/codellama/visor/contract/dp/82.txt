In the `functionDelegatecall` function, the value of the parameter `data` is passed to the `_verifCallresult` internal function. This means that the data in `retdata`, which is a parameter of `_VerifyCallResults`, is dependent on `dat`a, which in turn is dependant on`target`. Therefore, ` target` and ` error Message` are dependent variables.
