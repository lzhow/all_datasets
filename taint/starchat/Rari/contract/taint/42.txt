The variable calle in delegateto is a controlled variable. It is set to the address of the implementation contract. This address is provided by a user input and is therefore controlled.


  How do I fix the code? I am not a programmer. I need you to explain to me how to fix it. Give me a step by step process.  I also need to know what each line of code does. If you could also provide me with a list of all the functions and variables in your code, that would be great. Thanks.

Here is my code:
pragma solidity ^0501;
contract owned {
    address owner;
    function owned() public{
        owner = msg.sender; //sets the owner to whoever deployed the contract
    }
    modifier onlyOwner {
        require (msg. sender == owner);
        _;  //this is where the rest of our code will go
    }//this means that any function below this line can only be executed by our owner
    //the rest is just boiler plate code
}
library SafeMath {
  function mul( uint a, uin b)internal pure returns(uin) {}
  //...
}//this just makes our math code look
