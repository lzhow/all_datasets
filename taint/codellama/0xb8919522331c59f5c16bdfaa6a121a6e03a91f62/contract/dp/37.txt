The variable recipients in function SendValue is not dependent on variable in FunctionStaticcall. This is because the recipent variable is a parameter of the sendvalue function, and the FunctionstaticCall function does not have any parameters. Therefore, the data in recipents is independent of any data passed to the functions.
