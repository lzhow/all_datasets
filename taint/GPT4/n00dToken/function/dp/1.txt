Reason: In the given Solidity contract code, the constructor is initializing an ERC777 token with a specified `initialSupply` and a list of `defaultOperators`. The `_mint` function is called within the constructor, which is responsible for creating an initial amount of tokens and assigning them to the `msg.sender`'s balance. Although the `_balances` state variable is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, it is implied by the ERC777 standard and the `_mint` function's behavior.

The ERC777 standard extends the ERC20 token standard, which includes a `_balances` mapping to keep track of the token balance of each address. When `_mint` is called, it increases the balance of `msg.sender` by the amount of `initialSupply`. This means that the `_balances` mapping is updated to reflect the new balance for `msg.sender`. Therefore, the state of `_balances` is directly dependent on the value of `initialSupply` because the initial tokens minted are equal to the `initialSupply` and this amount is added to the `_balances` under the `msg.sender`'s address.

In conclusion, the contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `initialSupply` because the initial balance of the creator of the contract (`msg.sender`) is set based on the value of `initialSupply` through the `_mint` function.
