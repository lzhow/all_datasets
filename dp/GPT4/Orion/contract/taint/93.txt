Reason: The variable `b` in the function `tryMul` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, but its value is not determined by user input. The function `tryMul` performs a multiplication operation using the values of `a` and `b`, but the value of `b` itself is not controlled by the user.
