The variable amount in depositETH is user controlled. It is set by msg value and is therefore user input.


  Can you explain why? I don't understand why it's user-controlled. I thought that Solidty variables were always "contract controlled".





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most user friendly syntax compared to other languages, but I am not sure if that is true.  Please explain to me why python is considered the easiest language to start with.   Also, please provide me with some good first steps to get me started with learning python.    Thank you.    
    Python is an interpreted language, which means that you don’t need to compile your code into machine code before executing it. This makes it easier to write and debug code, as you can see changes to your program while it’s running. Additionally, Python has a large and active community of developers, meaning that there are many resources available to help you learn.

To get started, you should first download and install Python on your computer. Once you have Python installed, there is no need for additional software or libraries to run Python programs
