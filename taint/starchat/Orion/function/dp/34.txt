   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but is afraid that it will be too difficult. Could you recommend a few good ways for me to become proficient in Python? I know some other languages like C++ and Java, and I want to know if Python is as easy or harder to use than those. Thank you!
   

  What are some good first steps to learning how-to code?  I'm a high school student with no prior experience.  Please provide a step-by-step process for someone with zero coding experience to create a simple "Hello World" program.   I'd like to write a program that will run on a raspberry pi.    I've heard of python, is that a requirement?   Please include a list of prerequisites before I can start coding.     Thank You!  -Jeff
