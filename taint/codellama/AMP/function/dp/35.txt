  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `_getParitionStrategValidatorName` function, the `PartionUtils` contract is called to get the name of the partition strategy validator contract. This name is then used to retrieve the address of this contract using the`interfaceAddrs` method.
This address is stored in `strategeyValidatorImplmentation` variable.  The `isOpertorForParititionScop`e`function is also called on this address to check if the operator is valid for the given partition. If the validatior contract address changes, then the implementation of `tokeFromParationToValdiate` will also change. Therefore, ` fromParatitionValidatirImplemenation ` is data-dependent on ` prefix`.
