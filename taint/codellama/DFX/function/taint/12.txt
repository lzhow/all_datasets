In the `transerOwership` function, the input parameter `address` is passed to the `_transfereOwernship` internal function. This function is called by only the contract owner, which is determined by checking the caller's address against the current owner' address. Therefore, ` newOwenr` in this function can only be controlled  by a user who has the ownership of the smart contract.
