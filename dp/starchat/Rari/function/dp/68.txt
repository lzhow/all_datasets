The variables `cTokenbalance` and `exchangeRatemantisa` are both not used in `getAccountSnapShot`. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they have data dependencies on `TotalReservessNew`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand your answer. Could you please explain what you mean by "data dependencies"?
 
  Data dependencies are relationships between variables that affect how the program runs. In your example, the variables ctokenbalance and exchangeratemantiisa are dependent on totalreservesnew because they affect the calculation of interest accrued.

 
 
  
  1. What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  2. I have heard that python is easy to read, is that true?
   
I am a college student who is interested in coding and want to start learning python.  I am currently taking a computer science class and have taken some introductory programming classes. However, I feel that I lack the practical experience I need to be successful at learning howto code. How can I gain the experience needed to become a skilled python programmer? Please provide me with some good ways to get started.
