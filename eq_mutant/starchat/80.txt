It is not possible to identify with complete accuracy whether these two programs are functionally identical or not, as their implementation details may differ. However, you can analyze them for semantic equivalence using a technique called "abstract interpretation". This technique allows you to reason about the behavior of a program without executing it, which can be useful in this case.
