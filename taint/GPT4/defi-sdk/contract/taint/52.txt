Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `safeApproveMax` is an argument to the function, and its value is determined by the caller of the function. In the context of smart contracts, "the user" typically refers to an external entity interacting with the contract. However, without additional context about how `safeApproveMax` is called within the contract or by external contracts, it is not possible to definitively classify whether `amount` is controlled by the user. It could be set by the user if they are calling this function directly, or it could be determined by the contract logic itself in which case it would not be user-controlled. Therefore, the control over `amount` is unknown based on the given code snippet alone.
