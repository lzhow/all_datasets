Yes

The contract state `balanceOf` is data dependent on the variable `_token1` in the function `burn`. The reason for this is that within the `burn` function, `_token1` is used to determine the address of the second token in the pair. The balance of this token for the contract address (`address(this)`) is then retrieved and used to calculate the amount of token1 that the user is entitled to when burning their liquidity tokens. This amount is subsequently subtracted from the `balanceOf` mapping for the contract address when `_safeTransfer` is called to transfer the token1 amount to the user's address (`to`). Thus, the state of `balanceOf` is directly affected by the value of `_token1` through the balance and transfer operations within the `burn` function.
