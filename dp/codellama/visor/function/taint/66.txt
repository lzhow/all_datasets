The variable _ currentSnapshotID is a private variable in a contract, and it cannot be controlled directly by a user because it can only be modified by calling the _ snapshot() function, which is an internal function. Therefore, the value of _ _CurrentSnapshot ID is determined by internal logic and cannot directly be influenced by users.
