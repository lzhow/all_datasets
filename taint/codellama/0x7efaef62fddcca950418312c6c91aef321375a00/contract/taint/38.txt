  
No, the `_ total Supply ` variable in mint function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created in function scope and is only accessible within the mint() function.

The `_m int()` function creates a new instance of the `PanCakEER C2O` contract and initializes it with the total supply of liquidty tokens. This total suppy is determined by calculating the minimum liquidtiy required to be minted based on the reserves of token  and the current total liquiditiy supply.  The `_ m int() ` function does not take any input from the caller, so the value of `_totalsupply is` not directly controlledby theuser.
