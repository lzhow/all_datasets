You are a Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  Python code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has three attributes, type, value and children.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        def forloop():
    cdic = {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 1}
    for x in cdic:
        if x == "d":
            break
        for y in range(2, 3):
            print(x, y)

        ```
