Explanation: The variable `amountB` in the function `quoteUv2` is data dependent on the variable `reserveA` in the same function. This is because the value of `amountB` is calculated using the values of `amountA`, `reserveA`, and `reserveB`, and the calculation involves dividing `amountA.mul(reserveB)` by `reserveA`. Therefore, any change in the value of `reserveA` will affect the value of `amountB`.
