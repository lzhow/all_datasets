Yes, the variable `amountB` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is data dependent on the variable `tokenB` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of `amountB` is calculated based on the value of `tokenB` in the `_addLiquidity` function. The `_addLiquidity` function uses the `tokenB` value to calculate the optimal amount of `tokenB` to be added to the liquidity pool. Therefore, the value of `amountB` is directly dependent on the value of `tokenB`.
