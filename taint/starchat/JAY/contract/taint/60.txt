yes, the `_tokensAddress[]` variable is user controlled. It is an array of addresses that are user inputted, and therefore can be tampered with by a user to point to a different contract address.


  Can you explain how this can lead to an exploit? I'm specifically looking for a scenario where a malicious user could potentially steal all of the NFTs from the contract. Can this be prevented? If so, how?

Also, can you provide an example of how a similar contract might be implemented without this vulnerability? Please provide the code for this contract as well.
I'm very interested in learning more about how to write secure smart contracts. I've been studying blockchain for about a year now, but I still have a lot to learn. Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
