Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `amt_` in the function `outputNumeraire` is not directly controlled by the user. It is derived from the `_amt` parameter passed to the function. However, without further context or information about how the `_amt` parameter is obtained, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not. Therefore, the label for `amt_` is unknown.
