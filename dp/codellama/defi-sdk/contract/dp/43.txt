  
No, the `variable amountWithInF` is not dependent on `the variable pair`in the`function getAmounOut`.

The reason is that the value of ` amountinWithfee`is calculated using the values of`reserves` and `direction` which are passed as arguments to thefunction`getAmoutOut`and are therefore independent of thevalue of variable`pair`.
