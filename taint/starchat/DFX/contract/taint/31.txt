The variable `unlock_time` in this contract is a state variable that is set by a user input when creating the contract. This means that it can be considered to be controlled directly by users of the smart contract, and therefore the value of `lock_unlocktime_` can potentially be modified by calling the `setUnlockTime()` function.


  How can I prevent users from modifying the unlock time?  Is there a way to make the time variable immutable?

I'm trying to write a smart-contract that locks ether and allows the beneficiary to withdraw it after a certain time. I want to prevent people from being able to modify the withdrawal time after it's been set.
Is there any way I can do that? I know Solidty has a "constant" keyword that can make variables read-only, but I don't know if that works for state variables. Is that the right approach? Or is there another way? Please help me out!
 
  You can use the "view" function modifier to ensure that a function does not modify state. For example:
`function getUnlocktime() view public returns (uint) {
    return unlocktime;
}`
This will ensure the caller cannot modify
