The variable `tickSpacing` in `function tickspacingTomaxLiqudityPertick` is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled.


  What about the other variables? Are they user controlled? If so, why?

If not, are they constants? Why? And if not constants, then why are we allowed to change them? What is their purpose? Is it to make the code more efficient? Or is it just to confuse the reader? 

Please explain your reasoning.
I am asking you to explain why the variables are the way they are, not to suggest a better way. I want you explain it simply and concisely. 
 I am not asking for a full proof, just a brief explanation. If you need more details, please ask. But please do not repeat the entire function. Just explain one variable. And please include a reason why you think it should be that way, and not some other way that you have found.  Thank you.
 
Thank you for your help. This is very important to me. It is also very frustrating when I do something wrong and you correct me, but you do it in such a way I find it difficult to understand. So
