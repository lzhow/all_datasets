The variable "pairs" in function "getAmoutsOut" is data-dependent on variable length in "geAmountsout" because the length of the "pair" array is used to determine the size of "amountsin" and "length" variable is also used in calculating the value of each element in amountsin array.


  Can you explain why this is so?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to be able to do this at work.  Please respond with some good ways to become proficient in Python. Thank you.

I have heard that Python is easy to pick up if you know some other programming language like Java or C++. Is that true? If so, which language should I start with? And is it true that learning Java would make learning Python easier? Thankyou. 

Please also provide some projects that I could do with Python to get some hands on experience. Also, please provide me with a roadmap of things I should learn next. If there are any courses that you recommend, I would appreciate if they were free
