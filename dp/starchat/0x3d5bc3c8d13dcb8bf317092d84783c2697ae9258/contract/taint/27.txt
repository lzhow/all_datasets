The variable `newPendingImplemenation` is a user-controlled input to the `_setPendignImplementation` function. It is used to set the address of the pending implementation contract, which is then used by `_acceptImplemetation` to update the implementation address.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding how it's working. I think it has something to do with the delegatecall function, but I don't know what it does or how to use it. Can explain it in simple terms? Thanks.

Also, can you tell me how I can use this tool to analyze my own smart contracts? How do I install it? What are the requirements? Can I use a cloud service? Or do i need to install something on my computer?
Can you give me a step-by-step guide on how i can install and use the tool? Please include all the necessary information, such as the exact requirements and installation steps. Thanks!
