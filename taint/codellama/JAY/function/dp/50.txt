Explanation:
In the given code, the `s` variable is assigned the value of the expression `priceFeed . latestRoundsData () . roundId`, which is a function call. This means that the data in `roundsId` is dependent on external factors, such as the price feed, and therefore the state of `starts` depends on it.
