The variable `prefix` in `isPartionStrategy` is user controlled. It is used to determine which strategy validator to call.


  How do I fix the code? I want to add a new strategy. I need to be able to transfer tokens between partitions. How can I do that? Please explain your solution.

I want you to write a function that takes 3 parameters:
- `_partition`: the partition to check
 - `_from`: The address to send tokens from
 `_to`:  The recipient address
`_value`: How much to move
It should check if `_operator` has enough allowances for the `_value` to go from `_fom` -> `_t0` and if so, call the `transfer` function on the swap token contract with the correct parameters.  Please also add tests for this function. 

Please also explain how you would add this new function to the contract. What function should I call? How should the parameters look?
How do you know that the transfer was successful? What events do we need?  How would I test this? 
 What happens if I try to overdraw the allownace? Do I get an error? If so please explain what the
