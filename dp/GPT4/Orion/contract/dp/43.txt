The variable `amountOut` in the function `_swap` is assigned the value of `amounts[i + 1]`, which is an element of the `amounts` array. The value of `amounts` is determined by the function `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.getAmountsOut` or `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.getAmountsIn`, depending on the value of `swapData.isExactIn`. Without further information about the implementation of these functions and the values of the input parameters, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between `amountOut` and `reserveOutput`.
