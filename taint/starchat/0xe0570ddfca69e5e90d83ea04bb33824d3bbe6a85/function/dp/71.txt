The contract variable `_shares` is not used in this function, so it is irrelevant for determining if `_share` has a dependency on ` r`.

However, the internal Solidty function `_burn` does use the `_shahres` variable, which means that `_ shares` would be considered a dependent variable.
In this case, ` _share ` would have to be included in a memory or storage variable in order to maintain the data dependence relationship between the two.


  Can you explain how to do that?
 
  Sure! Here's how you can determine if a contract's state is data-dependent on a variable:

1. Identify the relevant contract and function. In this example, it's the `ERC20.sol` contract, and the withdraw function in particular.

2. Determine the scope of the variables. This includes the local variables, parameters, contract storage variables (if any), and global variables in Solidit.y. For example:
- The local variable _ shares is relevant to the ERC223. Withdraw function and is therefore relevant.  The function does not use _ symbol, but it does modify the balance of msg. sender. Therefore, symbol is
