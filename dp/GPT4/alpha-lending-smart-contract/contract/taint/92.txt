Label: no

Reason: The variable `_NOT_ENTERED` is a private constant within the `ReentrancyGuard` contract, which means its value is set at compile time and cannot be changed thereafter. It is not exposed to any function that allows for user interaction to modify its value. Since it is a constant, its value is hardcoded into the contract and does not change during the lifetime of the contract on the blockchain. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
