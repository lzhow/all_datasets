yes, the `_status` variable in `nonReentrency` modifier is a state variable that is used to track whether the modifier has been entered or not. Since it's declared as a private variable, and is only modified in one function, there is nothing the users can do to manipulate its value. Therefore, we can safely assume that it can be considered as not being controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was five. Thanks!





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-Pert P LL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, or LL moves. J and P algorithms are generally considered easier than LL algorithms, as they require fewer turns to solve the cube.
J Pert is short for Jâ€™s Pseudolegal Algorithm. It is based on the idea that a J algorithm can always be transformed into a P algorithm by adding a few more moves, so the P part of the algorithm actually solves the puzzle. This is because the only way to get into an illegal
