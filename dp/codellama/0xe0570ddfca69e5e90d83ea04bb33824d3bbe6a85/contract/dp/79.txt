  
No, the `appovalDelay ` contract variable is data-independent of the `_ token` variable in function`in CaseTokesGetStruck`.

The ` approvaleDelay  ` variable stores the delay period for the proposal of a new strategy, which is a constant value set at the time of deployment. It is independent of any variable or state in any function.
On the other hand, `_tokens` is an argument passed to function  in Case Tokens Get Stuck, and it is used to determine the amount of tokens to transfer. However, this variable does not affect the value of ` appoval Delay  `.
Therefore, ` in case tokens get stuck` function doesnot depend on ` _tokesn` and ` aproval Delaye`.
