Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `position` in the function `get` is determined by the input parameters `owner`, `tickLower`, and `tickUpper`, which are provided by the user when they call the function. The `owner` parameter is typically the address of the user interacting with the contract, and `tickLower` and `tickUpper` are bounds chosen by the user for their position within a liquidity pool. The combination of these parameters is used to compute a unique key via `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, tickLower, tickUpper))`, which is then used to access the user's `Position.Info` from the `self` mapping. Since the user has control over the inputs that determine the value of `position`, it is labeled as 'yes'.
