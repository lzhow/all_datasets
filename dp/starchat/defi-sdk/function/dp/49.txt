Yes, the `lenght` variable is data-dependent on `pair` because it is used to loop through the array `paires`.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I heard it's easy, what do I need? What IDE should I use? Are there any libraries I should know about? Can you recommend a book or a course I could take? Please be as specific as possible. I'm not asking for a full tutorial, just pointers to the most useful resources. Thank you!
 

  Python is an interpreted language, which means that you don’t need to compile your code before executing it. This makes it easier to write and debug code, as you can see changes immediately without having to re-run the entire program. However, this also means it can be slower to run than compiled languages like C++ or Java.

  If you’re just starting out with programming, I would recommend using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or Visual Studio
