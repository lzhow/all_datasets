Explanation: The variable `assetAddress` in the function `baseUnitToDecimal` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as a parameter to the function. The value of `assetAddress` is determined by the caller of the function, which could be the user or another contract. Without further context, it is not possible to determine if the user has control over the value of `assetAddress`.
