Explanation: The variable `borrowIndex` in the function `setCompBorrowSpeedInternal` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the value of `cToken.borrowIndex()`, which is a function call to the `borrowIndex()` function of the `cToken` contract. The value of `borrowIndex` is determined by the implementation of the `borrowIndex()` function in the `cToken` contract and is not controlled by the user.
