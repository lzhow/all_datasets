  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the ER2C token contract, the `approval` function is used to allow a spending contract to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner. This function takes three arguments: `owner`, `recipent`, and `amount`. The `sender` and the `_msg.sender()` are the same, which means that the spends are controlled and approved by user, so the answer is yes.
