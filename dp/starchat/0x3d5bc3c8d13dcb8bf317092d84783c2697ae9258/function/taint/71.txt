Can you explain to me how the code works? I'm not very good at maths





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples? Can you name a few popular ones? Explain them to my in an easy to understand manner. I am a complete beginner when it comes to this topic. Thank you.  I want you to explain it in a way that is understandable to someone with little to no experience with these things. If you could also provide some code examples that would be amazing. Thanks again. This is for a university assignment.
