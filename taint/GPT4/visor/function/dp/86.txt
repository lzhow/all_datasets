Reason: In the Solidity function `safeDecreaseAllowance`, the variable `spender` is used as an argument in the call to `token.allowance(address(this), spender)` and subsequently in the call to `_callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, newAllowance))`. The variable `value` is used to calculate `newAllowance` by subtracting it from the result of `token.allowance(address(this), spender)`. Since `newAllowance` is dependent on `value` and `spender` is used in the context where `newAllowance` is also used, there is a data dependency between `spender` and `value`. The value of `newAllowance` is computed based on the `value` and is then used in a function call that also includes `spender`. Therefore, any changes to `value` will affect the computation of `newAllowance`, which is directly related to the actions performed with `spender`.
