Explanation: 

The variable `sqrtPX96` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, which means its value is determined by the caller of the function. Without further context, it is not possible to determine if the value of `sqrtPX96` is controlled by the user or not.
