These two programs are functionally equivalent. While the original program assigns the variable a to b and b to c, when the patch program is applied, it decrements a and assigns it to t, which is then assigned to a. After this, t is assigned back to the respective b or c. Therefore the functionality of the program doesn't change. 

However, this might not be true in all scenarios, and as such, comparing the "semantics" of two source codes should be considered when analyzing them for equivalence.
