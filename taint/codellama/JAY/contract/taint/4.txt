  
No, the `_totalsupply ` variable in this function is uncontrolled by user input. It is a constant value that is set in a constructor and cannot be changed by any user action.

The `_ totalsuply  ` value is calculated by dividing the total supply of the contract by its current balance. This value does not change based on user actions and is therefore not under the control of any individual user or entity.
