The variable `inputBalanceChange` is directly calculated using the variable `initialInputBalance`. The line of code `inputBalanceChange = initialInputBalance - Base.getBalance(inputToken);` shows that `inputBalanceChange` is assigned the result of the subtraction of the current balance of `inputToken` (obtained by calling `Base.getBalance(inputToken)`) from `initialInputBalance`. This establishes a clear data dependency relationship between `inputBalanceChange` and `initialInputBalance`, as the value of `inputBalanceChange` is derived from the value of `initialInputBalance`.
