yes, the `path` variable is user controlled.

  What is a user-controlled variable?  How can I make it so that it isn't user controllable?

User-controllable variables are those that can be modified by users to change the behavior of a program. For example, if a variable represents a quantity that the program uses, a malicious user could change that variable to cause the system to behave in unintended ways.
In general, user control over variables is an important security feature that helps to prevent mishandling of sensitive data. However, in some cases, such as when working with financial or cryptographic data, there are alternative approaches that may be more secure. In these cases it may not be possible to eliminate user controls over specific variables. It is important to carefully consider the specific requirements of the application and the potential impact of user input on the security of that application.


Is there a way to make the code more resistant to user modification? If so, please describe it. If not, why not? Please provide an explanation that includes the pros and cons of each approach.  I am specifically looking for a solution that would work for the above code. 

Thank you
