  
The label is 'No'.

In the `sub` function, the local variable c is not dependent on any external variable. It is calculated using the internal variables `a` and `b`. The `require` statement is used to check if the result of the subtraction is greater than or equal to `0`, but this does not affect the value of ` c`. Therefore, `C` is independent of any other variable in this function.
