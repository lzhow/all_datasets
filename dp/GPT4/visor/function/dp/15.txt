The variable `low` in the function `findUpperBound` is data dependent on the variable `mid` because the value of `low` is directly affected by the value of `mid` within the while loop. Specifically, `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1` in the else branch of the if statement within the loop. This means that the value of `mid` directly influences the subsequent value of `low` as the loop iterates.
