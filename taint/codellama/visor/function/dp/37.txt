  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `while` loop of the first function, the value of `high` is dependent on `mid`, which is calculated using the average of low and high. Therefore, `middle` depends on both `Low` and `High`.
Similarly, in function 2, both the values of high and low are dependent variables.
Therefore, low is data-dependent on array in both functions.
