The variable new_admin in function `change_admi` is a user-controlled variable. It is set to a new value by a call to the `set_new_adm` function in `master_price_oracle.py`. This function is only callable by an address that is stored in a variable named `admin`.

In the case of the Master Price Oracle, the value of `can_overwrite_admins` does not matter, as it can only be set once in its constructor.
This means that the only way to change the address of admin is to call the set_nwe_a_dmin function, which requires a signature from the current admin address.


  Can you explain how the signature is checked?  What is being signed? What are the requirements for the new admin to be able to sign? Is it the hash of a message? If so, what message is it? How is that message created? Can the message be changed to allow the previous admin (or anyone) to take control of this contract?
Can you also explain what the can_overwite_ admins variable is for? Why does it not have any effect on the security of your contract if it's set incorrectly?
