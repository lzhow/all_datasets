In the `isContract` function, the local variable `size` is assigned the value of `extcodesiz(address)`, which is a built-in function that returns the size of the code at the given address. This function does not depend on any other variable or state in this function.
On the other hand, in ` functioncall`, the parameter `target` and the return value `data` are both passed to the internal function`functioncallwithvalue`, which also returns a value. However, this value is not used in any way in`iscontract`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
