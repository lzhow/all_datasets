The variable _curveToburn is a parameter of the emergenctWithdraw function. It represents the number of curves that the owner wants to burn. Since it's a uint, the value is set by a user and is therefore controlled.


 
Please explain why





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and serving of web content works under the hood. Thanks!



  An incremental bundlers like Webpack is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application. This allows for faster loading times since the browser only has to make one request to download all of these files instead of making multiple requests for each file. Additionally, an incremental bundle can be optimized further by only rebuilding parts of a project that have changed since last build.

Webpack is often used in combination with a module bundlere like Browserify or Rollup. These module bundleers allow for more fine grained control over the way the code in a application is organized and packaged.
