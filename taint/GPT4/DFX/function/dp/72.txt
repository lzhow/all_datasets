Explanation: The variable `amount` in the function `depositWithWhitelist` is not directly dependent on the variable `_deadline` in the function `deposit`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `_deadline` in the code snippet provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency relationship between `amount` and `_deadline` based on the given code.
