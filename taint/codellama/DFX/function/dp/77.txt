  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `require` statement checks if the difference between the next utilization and the previous utilizations is greater than or equal to `0` or `max_diff`. The `diff_` variable is calculated as the subtraction of `_next_util` and `_prev_utility`.
Since the `_maxDiff` is not used in any calculation, it is independent of the value of ` _ diff`. Therefore, `Max_Diff_ ` is data-dependent on `_ diff_`.
