In the `exitMarked` function, the contract calls the internal function `_exitCToken`. This function sets the value of the global variable `_cTkn` to the address of `ctoken`.
Then, in `redeeemBorroweVerif`y, it calls `_reedeem` which sets `_borroewr` equal to `borrowr`.  `_repBorr` is set to `_pAyer` and `_bOrrwer` are set equal.
Therefore, `CToken` depends on `Payer`.
