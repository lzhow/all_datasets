  
No, the `variable amountOptimial` is not dependent on ` variable token B` because the value of ` amount Optimal ` is calculated based on other variables such as `reserves` and `desired amounts` which are independent of the token `B`.

The function `OrinMultiPollLibrary` calculates the optimal amount of token A to be added to the liquidty pool based only on its own reserves and the desired amount, without taking into account the reserver of Token B. Therefore, `Amount Optimized` does not depend on Token ` B`.
