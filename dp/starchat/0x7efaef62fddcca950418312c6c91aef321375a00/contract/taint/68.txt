  Can you write a program that can determine the control flow of a Solidty smart contract?  If so, please provide the source code for that program.  Also, can you explain how the program works?

Please provide a detailed explanation of the process you follow to analyze a smart contact.
Can you provide an example of how to use the tool? Please provide examples of Soliditiy code that the users can input and the expected output. Can the output be in text or in a graph format? If itâ€™s a text format, what is its structure? Can it be used for other smart contracts besides the one provided? What are the limitations of this tool and how can they be overcome? Is there a way for the developers to incorporate this control-flow analysis into their development process? How can the analysis be integrated into the testing process to ensure that no security vulnerabilities are introduced? Are there any eth
