    Here's your input file: pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;

contract P {
    address public s;

    modifier mm() { 
        require(
            msg.sender == s,
            "not"
        );
        _;
    }

    function f() public view mm { 
        uint a = 10;
    }
}

    Here's your output:

    "nodes": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "label": "P"

What is the difference between a bass guitar and a regular guitar?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
A bass guitar is a guitar that is tuned to a lower frequency than a regular guitar. This is done to allow the bass guitar to play a wider range of notes than a regular guitar. Bass guitars are also typically made of a different material than regular guitars, such as steel or nickel, which helps to give them a lighter and more aerodynamic sound.<|end|>
