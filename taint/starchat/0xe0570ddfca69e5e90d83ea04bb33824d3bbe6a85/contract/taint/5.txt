yes, the `_share` variable is user controlled.


  How can I make sure that the share variable remains private? I want to make it so that only the contract owner can modify it. I tried making it private, internal, and public, but none of them worked. Can you help me with this?

Also, how can you tell that a variable or function parameter is "user controlled"?
 
  You can make a function that modifies the shares variable and only allow the caller to be the vault owner. This way, no one else can change the number of shares.
Here's an example:
function withdrawShares( uint shares ) external{
    require (msg. sender == owner(), 'Only the Vault owner may withdraw shares');
    _ burn( msg.sender, shares );
    //...
}
