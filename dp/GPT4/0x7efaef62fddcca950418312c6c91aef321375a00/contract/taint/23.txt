Reason: The variable `_reserve1` in the function `_update` is a private variable that is assigned the value of the contract's reserve balance for token1. It is updated based on the contract's balance of token1, which changes as a result of liquidity provision, burning, and swapping operations that are performed through the contract's functions. While users can indirectly affect `_reserve1` by interacting with the contract's functions that result in these operations, they do not have direct control over the variable itself. The update to `_reserve1` is handled internally by the contract's logic in a controlled manner, ensuring that it reflects the actual reserve balance after any transaction. Therefore, `_reserve1` is not directly controlled by the user.
