The function `_transfer` has two parameters that are passed to it: `_from` and `_to`. The function also has a local variable `value`.

`_from`: This parameter is passed into the `_approve` function, which is called before the transfer. This means that the value of `_allowances[from][msg.senders]` is used in this calculation.
`to`: The `_balances` mapping is updated based on this parameter. If the `to` parameter equals `msgSender`, then the balance of the current account is decreased.
