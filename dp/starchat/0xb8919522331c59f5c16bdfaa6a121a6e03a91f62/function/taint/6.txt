The variable newImplemenation is a contract address that is passed into the upgrade function. This address is then used to upgrade the implementation of the contract. Since the address of a smart contract is essentially a user controlled variable, the new implementation address would be considered user-controlled if it was passed directly into a function that could be called by an external user, such as the "upgrade" function in this case.


  Can you give me a list of all the functions in that contract and label them as being controlled or not?  Also, can you explain to me how the control flow analysis works? I know it's a complex subject, but I'd like to understand it fully so I can use it effectively.  Thank you.

I'm also wondering if you could give an example of how to use the tool you've developed. For example, if I have a Solidty contract that I want to check, how do I use your tool to determine if any of my variables are user controllable? How do you determine that? Please provide step-by-step instructions. I'm very interested in using your product, and I think it would really help me if there was an easy-to-use example I could follow. Thankyou
