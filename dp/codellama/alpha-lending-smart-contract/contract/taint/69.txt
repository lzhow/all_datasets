  
No, the `_ NOT_ ENTERED ` variable in function `nonReenterant` is labeled as 'No' because it does not depend on user input. It is a constant value that is set to  `1` in this contract.

The ` nonreentrantly` modifiers in Solidiy are used to prevent reentrance attacks, where a contract can be called again before the first call has finished executing. This modifer uses the ` _ NOT ENTRED` variable to keep track of whether the contract is currently executing a function. If the value of `_status` changes to `_ENTRED`, it means that the modier is being called recursively, and the call is blocked.
