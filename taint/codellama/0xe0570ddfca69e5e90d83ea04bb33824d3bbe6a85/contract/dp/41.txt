  
No, the variables `_ withdraw` and ` r` are independent.

The variable` _ withdraw `is calculated based on` r `in the previous line, but it is a separate variable that is used to withdraw the funds from` want `contained in` strategy`. The variable is only used in this function and is never used again, so it does not have any impact on any other variable or state. Therefore, it can be considered independent of the other variables and states in `BeefVaulV 6`.
