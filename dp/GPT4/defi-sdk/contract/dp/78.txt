Yes

The variable `protocolFeeSignature` in the function `execute` is data dependent on the variable `swapType` in the function `getReturnedAmounts`. The reason for this is that `protocolFeeSignature` is used in `validateProtocolFeeSignature` to validate the protocol fee details, which indirectly affects the calculation of the protocol fee amount in `getReturnedAmounts` through the `swapDescription.protocolFee` that is passed along. The `swapType` determines how the returned amounts are calculated, including the protocol fee amount. Since `execute` calls `getReturnedAmounts` and passes `swapDescription` which contains `swapType`, and the protocol fee amount is influenced by the validation of `protocolFeeSignature`, there is a data dependency between these two variables.
