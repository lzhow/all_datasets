  
No, the `_ diff` variable in function `withDraw` is uncontrolled by user because it's calculated based on the balance of the token in this contract and the amount of tokens that can be withdrawn.

The `_withdra`w variable is calculated by subtracting the current balance from `b`, which is a variable that stores the total amount that is available to be transferred. This calculation is done in a way that ensures that the value of `_ withdraw` will never exceed the available balance. Therefore, `_ _ diff `is not a user-control variable.
