Explanation: The variable `_x` in the function `get_y` is not directly dependent on the variable `result` in the function `baseUnitToCurveDecimal`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `result` in the code snippet provided. However, it is possible that the value of `result` indirectly affects the value of `_x` through the `amp` parameter passed to the `get_y` function. Without further information about the relationship between `result` and `amp`, it is not possible to determine the data dependency between `_x` and `result` with certainty.
