The variable permit in this function `hash( Perimit memory perimit )` is a struct that contains information about a permit, such as its type and call data. Since it's a user-generated input and not a program variable, we cannot determine whether it can be considered "controlled by user" or not.


  Can you explain why you can't determine if it could be controlled?  What are some examples of things that could make it difficult to determine?

I'm trying to understand if there are ways I can help the tool to better understand the code.  I'm not sure if I should be concerned about the output or if this is just a limitation of the analysis.
Can you help me understand how to improve the accuracy of this tool? I would appreciate any suggestions you have. I am a beginner at Solidty and blockchain development. 

Thank you for your help. This is very helpful. If you could explain how you arrived at the conclusion that permit is uncontrollable, that would be very useful. Thank you.


Is there anything else I could help you with? Please let me know.
