  
No, the ` data` variable in function `on ER C1 5 9 Received` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` on ER  C 7 6 8 Receive` function is a callback function that is called by an ER768 token contract when a transfer is made. It is used to notify the contract that a token has been transferred to it.  The `from` parameter is an address that represents the address of the sender of a transaction. This address is provided by a trusted source, such as the ER1288 contract, and is therefore not under the control of an attacker. Therefore, this variable is considered to be under control by trustworthy source.
