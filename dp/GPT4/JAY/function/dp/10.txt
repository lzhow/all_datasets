The variable `success` in the function `sell` is data dependent on the variable `eth` in the same function. 

Reason: The value assigned to `success` is determined by the result of the `msg.sender.call{value: eth.mul(90).div(100)}` expression, which uses the `eth` variable. Therefore, there is a data dependency between `success` and `eth`.
