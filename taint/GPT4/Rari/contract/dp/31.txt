No. The variable `cToken` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `cTokens` in the function `claimRewards`. 

The reason is that the variable `cToken` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is a local variable that is passed as an argument to the function. Its value is determined by the caller of the function and is not influenced by the variable `cTokens` in the function `claimRewards`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
