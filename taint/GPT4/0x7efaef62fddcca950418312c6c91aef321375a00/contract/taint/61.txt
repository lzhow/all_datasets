Reason: The variable `_token1` in the function `burn` is assigned the value of the state variable `token1`, which is set during the initialization of the contract and represents the address of one of the tokens in the pair. The initialization function `initialize` can only be called once by the factory contract (which is typically a trusted entity that creates liquidity pairs), and not by an arbitrary user. Therefore, `_token1` is not controlled by the user but rather by the contract's initialization logic.
