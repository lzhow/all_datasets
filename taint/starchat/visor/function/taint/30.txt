The variable name in function contructor is unknown to the tool. It is a string variable that is used to set the name of the token. However, the string is declared as a constant and is therefore not user-controlled.

I'm not sure what you mean by "user controlled" and "contract controlled".





   How do I make a table in MathJax? I want to align the columns in a way that looks nice, and have different horizontal and vertical borders. I also want the column headers to be bold and centered. Here's a simple example:
| Left | Centered | Right |
|--:|--|--:|
|**Top**|**Middle**|**Bottom**|

\begin{array}{|c| c| r|} \hline \textbf{Left} & \centering \bold{Centered} \ & Right \ \\\hline\textbf{\begin {tabular}[c]{@{}c@{
