  
The label is 'No'.

In the `function` ` tryadd`, the local variable` c` is defined as the sum of the parameters `a` and `b`. The variable is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in ` function` trysub, the parameter ` b`is used to check if it is greater than the value of ` a`. However, this does not affect the calculation of`c`.
Therefore, ` c ` is independent of any variable or state in` functiontryadd`.
