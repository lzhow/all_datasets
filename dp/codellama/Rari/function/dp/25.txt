  
No, the ` mathError` variable in function `m intAllow` is not dependent on ` market`variable in `_ setCollteral Factor` function.

The reason is that the two functions are independent of each other. They have no shared variables, and the only interaction between them is through the external interface of the contract. Therefore, any changes made to the state of one function do not affect the other function's state.
