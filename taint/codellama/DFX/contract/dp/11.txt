  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `delegate` function, the `_data` parameter is passed to the callee contract, which is an instance of `IAsimltr`. The `abi.encodingWithSeletor` method is used to encode the data with the selector of the method to be called, in this case, `iAssmlt.viewrawAmountLPratio.seletcor`.
When the delegate function is called in `Assmilatros.getrate`, the encoded data is decoded and passed as an argument to `intakrawandgetbalance` and `outputraw`. In these functions, `_amount` is data-dependent on `_amt` because it is calculated using the value of `_ammount` passed in as a parameter.
Therefore, since the functions `getrawamountlpratio`and ` outputraw` are called with `_amout` as their argument, it can be concluded that `amunt_ ` in` viewrawamounlrat`is data dependend on` _quoateweight`in`view rawamountLprat`.
