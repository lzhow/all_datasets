Explanation: The variable `pool` in the function `pairForCurve` is data dependent on the variable `from` in the function `getAmountOutCurve` because the value of `from` is passed as an argument to the `pairForCurve` function, and the return value of `pairForCurve` is assigned to the variable `pool` in the `getAmountOutCurve` function. Therefore, any changes in the value of `from` will affect the value of `pool`.
