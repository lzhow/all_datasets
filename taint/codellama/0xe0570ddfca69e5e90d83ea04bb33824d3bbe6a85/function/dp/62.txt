In this case, the relationship between the `_allowedances ` contract variable and the `want()` function is not immediately apparent. However, we can infer that there is a potential data dependence between these two entities based on their names and their usage in context.
  The `_allownances()` contract function appears to be responsible for managing the allowances of the smart contract, which suggests that it may be used to determine the amount of tokens that can be transferred from one address to another. On the other hand, ` want()` is likely to represent the total amount that the user has deposited into the system.  Based on this information, it is possible that `_ allowedances ()` is data-dependent on ` ` because it relies on information about the current state of ` `. However , it's important to note that this is only a speculation, and a more thorough analysis of both the codebase and its documentation would be required to confirm this relationship definitively.
