  
No, the ` last` variable in observe single is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created in a function and it can't be modified by any external user or smart contract.

The ` observe` function is a view function, which means that it does not modify the state of the contract, and therefore, any local variables created within the scope of this function are not accessible from outside the smart contact.
