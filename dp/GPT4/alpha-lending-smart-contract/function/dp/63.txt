Reason: The variable `_fromTimestamp` in the function `calculateLinearInterest` is an independent parameter that is passed to the function and is used to calculate the linear interest within that function's scope. It is not influenced by any external state or variables outside of its function.

On the other hand, the variable `totalLiquidity` in the function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityShareAmount` is calculated within that function by calling `getTotalLiquidity(_token)`, which is likely to be dependent on the state of the `pools` mapping and the `_token` parameter passed to the function.

Since `_fromTimestamp` and `totalLiquidity` are used in separate functions and there is no indication that the value of `_fromTimestamp` is derived from or affects the calculation of `totalLiquidity`, there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables. They operate independently within their respective function scopes.
