Reason: The variable `_totalSupply` in the function `totalSupply` represents the total number of tokens in circulation for the contract. It is a state variable that is modified by functions that mint or burn tokens (e.g., `_mint` function).

On the other hand, the variable `_subtractedValue` in the function `decreaseAllowanceByPartition` is a parameter that represents the amount by which the allowance for a spender to spend tokens on behalf of an owner is decreased for a specific partition. This variable is used to adjust the allowance in the `_allowedByPartition` mapping, which tracks how much a spender is allowed to spend from an owner's balance in a specific partition.

The `_totalSupply` variable is not directly modified by the `decreaseAllowanceByPartition` function, nor does it rely on the value of `_subtractedValue`. The `decreaseAllowanceByPartition` function only affects the allowances set for token transfers between addresses and does not impact the total supply of tokens.

Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_totalSupply` and `_subtractedValue`.
