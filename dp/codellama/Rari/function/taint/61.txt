  
The variable 'a' in function 'mulScaler' is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the 'Exp' type is defined in this contract, and the type of the parameter 'm' of function'mulExp()'is also ' Exp'. Therefore, the value of ' a' can be controlled directly by a user, which is a potential security vulnerability.
