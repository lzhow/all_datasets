yes

In the provided Solidity function `sub`, the variable `z` is directly calculated from the expression `x - y`, which means that the value of `z` is dependent on the value of `y`. The `require` statement also includes a comparison that involves `y`, but the primary data dependency comes from the assignment `z = x - y`. Therefore, `z` is data dependent on `y`.
