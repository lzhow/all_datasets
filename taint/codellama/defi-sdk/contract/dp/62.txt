  
No, the ` marketPlaceFfeAmount ` variable in function  `execute` is not dependent on ` amount ` in ` handleEthInput` function.

The ` execute ` function is a public function that takes in several parameters, including ` input `, ` output ` and ` swap Description ` as inputs. It also has ` account Signatures `  and  'protocol Ffe Signatues ' as input parameters.  The `account Signatur`e is used to verify the signature of the account that is making the transaction. This signature is then used in  the  function 'validateAnd Expire Account Signatu`re to validate the signatur.e
  On the other hand,  th`handleEThInput `function is an internal function of `Router` contract that handles the input of Ether (ETC) . It takes 2 parameters `token` and`amount`. The function first checks if the amount is greater than the msg value. If it is, it reverts with an error message. Then it calls the safeTranserFrom function to transfer the ETC from the caller to the contract. Finally,it returns the absolute input amount.   The  variable  amount in this function does not affect the value of  market place fee amount  which is calculated in another function called `getReturnAmount`.
   Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
