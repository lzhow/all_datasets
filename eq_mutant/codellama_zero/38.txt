  
No. They are different. In the original code, `diff =x *x -N` calculates the difference between the square of `N`, and `mResult` stores the result of the squared root. However, in the mutated code ` diff=x/x-N`. This will cause the program to calculate the reciprocal of a number, which is not the correct way to find the root of an equation. Therefore the output of these two programs will be different, and they will have different meanings.
