yes, the factory state is data-dependent on amounts.

The function calls _getSwapOutputAmount, which in turn calls getAmount0 and getAmout1. These functions use the amounts array, so the state of the factories is dependent on it.


  Can you explain why this is so?
 
  The function call _swapsTokens calls the _Swap function, and the swap function uses the amount array. This means that the value of factory is determined by the values in amounts and therefore the entire contract is state dependent upon the array amounts

 
 
  
  1997: The Masters Tournament was held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.
