  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_swap` function, the `pair` variable is created using the factory address, `input`, and `output` variables.
`input` is assigned the value of `path`[`i`] in a for loop, which is a parameter of the add liquidty function.  `i <  path .length-1`
So, if `tokensA` and`tokeB` are passed as parameters to the`add liquid`function, then ` token A` will be passed to ` path` as ` tokensA`, ` toke B` to` path ` as` tokensB`, then`token A ` will become` token  AOr W E T H`in the for-loop. Therefore,`path [i]` will have the same value as the parameter`tokentA`.
Therefore, in this case, yes, it is data-dependent.
