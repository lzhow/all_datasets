  
The variable 'from' in withdraw function of the contract is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the withdrawal function takes in an address as an argument, which is then used to transfer tokens from the smart contract to the specified address. This means that the address of whoever is calling the `withdraw` function can be controlled and manipulated by a malicious user, potentially leading to a loss of funds or other security issues.
