  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `execute` function, the variables `output`, `swapDescription`, and `account` are passed as arguments to the internal function call `handleInput`. The `token` variable is also used in this function.
However, in `getAbosluteInputAmout`, the only variable used is `amount`.
Therefore, `absoluteInputAmmount` is data-dependent on `msg` and the other variables in`execute`.
