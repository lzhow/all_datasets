yes, it is.

The reason is that the `buyNFT` function calls the internal ` buyerc223` and `buyeRC775` functions, which in turn call the `_mint` method of the contract, changing the value of `nftSOLD`.


  Can you explain why this is data-dependent?
 
  The reason why `ERC2981` is considered data dependant is because it allows the owner of a smart contract to set a royalty fee for all future sales of their NFTs. This means that if the price of an NTF changes, the royalty fee will need be updated to reflect this change.

 
   How does the data in `priceFeed` change when the ETH/USD price changes?  Is it updated by the smartcontract owner? Or is it a separate oracle that is updated independently?
Can you provide a link to the documentation for the AggregationV2 contract? I want to understand how it works.  I am not familiar with it.
