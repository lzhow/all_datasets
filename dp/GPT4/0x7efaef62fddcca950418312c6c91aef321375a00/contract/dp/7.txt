The variable `rootKLast` in the function `_mintFee` is data dependent on the variable `balance1` in the function `mint`. The reason for this is that `rootKLast` is calculated based on the value of `kLast`, which is updated in the `mint` function. The `kLast` variable represents the product of the reserves (`reserve0` and `reserve1`) before the mint operation. During the `mint` function, `balance1` is used to calculate the new liquidity that is being added to the pool, which in turn affects the reserve (`reserve1`) after the mint operation. If a fee is on, `kLast` is updated to be the product of the updated reserves, which includes the new `balance1`. Therefore, changes to `balance1` during the minting process will affect the reserves and consequently the `kLast` value, which is used to calculate `rootKLast` in the `_mintFee` function. Thus, there is a data dependency relationship between `rootKLast` and `balance1`.
