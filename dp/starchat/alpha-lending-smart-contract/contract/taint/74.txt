The variable utilisationRate in calculateInteresRate function is user controlled.


  How does the contract owner set the values for the variables?  What is a good way to do this?

I'm not sure what you mean by "user controlled".





   How do I make a table in MathJax? I want to put the table inside a \begin{equation*} and \end{equations*} environment. I have copied the text below and it doesn't work. Can you tell me what I did wrong? 

Here is an example of a simple table:
\begin {array}{c|c}
a & b \\
--- & --- \\  % horizontal lines
c & d
 \End{array}



  You need to escape the curly braces in your latex code.  So the code should look like this:  \\begin \\{ array \\} \\c \\& \\d \\end \\ \\array \\

  I don't think that's correct. Could you please try again? Also, could you explain what escaping curlies brace means? Is there a specific reason why I need this to work? Thanks!
