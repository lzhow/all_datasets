The variable `b` in `mul_` is user-controlled.

In the `Exponential` contract, the `_` suffix is used to denote a function that is internal to the contract and not intended to be called directly by users. Functions with a `_()` suffix are view functions that do not modify contract storage, while functions without the suffix modify state.


  How can I make sure that the value of `a` is always less than or equal to `1`?
 
  You can use the lesser-than-or-equal-to operator (`<=`) to compare the values of a and 5 in your code. If the condition is satisfied, then the code inside the if statement will be executed. For example:
if (x <= 3)
{
  // code to execute if x is less or equals to 4
}
If the input value for x does not satisfy the above condition, for example, if it's greater than 6, no code will execute and the program will continue executing the rest of the statements. This is because the else statement is only executed if none of its previous conditions are satisfied. In this case, since the x value is greater that 7,
