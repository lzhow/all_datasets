  
No, the ` oldpendingadmin` variable in function `_setpengingadmin()` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created and destroyed within the scope of the `_ setpenguingAdmin()` function.

The ` _ setPenginAdmin ()` function is called by an external user, but the local variables created within its scope are not accessible to the external caller. Therefore, `OldPendinadmin ` is a private variable and is only accessible within `_SetPenguin Admin()` and cannot be controlled or accessed by external users.
