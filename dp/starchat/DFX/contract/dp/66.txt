yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_baseWeigh` and `_quouteWeight`, as well as the `address` of the contract itself, are all part of a state that is modified by the call to `intakenumerireLPratio`. This means that any function that reads from or writes to this state will have to be re-run after the state change.


  Can you explain why it's data-dependent?
 
  The `_assm` parameter is of type `Address`. The `isDataDependent` function is defined as follows:
`function isDataDepenedent(VariableDeclaration node) -> (boolean):`
* If the node is a `VariableStateElement`, then it returns `true`.
This means the parameter `node` is either a variable state element or a function parameter. Since the type of `_assm` can be either `uint` or `bytes`, the compiler cannot determine whether the value of `asmm` will be modified after it has been passed to the IAsimltr contract. Therefore, the return value is `unknown`.
