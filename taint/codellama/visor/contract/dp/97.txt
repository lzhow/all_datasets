  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `Address` library, the functions `sendValue`, `call`, and `delegateCall` are all implemented using the same pattern: they call the target contract's `fallback` function with the provided data.
For example, in `address.sendvalue`, the data is passed to the contract at `recipient` using `transfer`.
Similarly, ` address.functionCall`,`address .functionStaticcall` and` address . functiondelegate call` all call ` target . call`, passing the given data as an argument.  The ` functioncallwithvalue` method is similar, but it also passes the value as a parameter.   The` _ verifyCallresult` helper function checks the success of the call and returns the result data if the transaction was successful. If the  transaction failed, it reverts with an error message. In the case of ` sendvalue `,` call  ` and  `_ verifycallresult`,  the` target` variable is not used directly. However, these functions are implemented in terms of`functioncallWithvalue`.  Therefore, if `  target ` is data-dependent on ` recipients ` in` sendvalues`, it is also data - dependent on`target `in`call`. Similarly, since`_verifycallResult` is called with `retdata` as its first argument, and the return value of `_verifycalResult `is returned by ` call, delegatecall, sendValues, function callWith value and function staticcall ` , it follows that ` retdata ` depends on  both ` data `and ` value ` . Therefore , the answer is yes.
