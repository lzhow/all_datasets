In the `distributeborowerComp` function, the value of `compBorrwerindex[ctoken][ borower]` is set to the current value `of borrowindex. mantissa`. This means that the data in `ctokencToken` is used to set the state of the contract.
On the other hand, in `_ setcompSpeeeds` , the values of supplyspeeds and borrowspee ds are used as inputs to update the compSpeeed of each token. This function does not modify the ctoken state.
