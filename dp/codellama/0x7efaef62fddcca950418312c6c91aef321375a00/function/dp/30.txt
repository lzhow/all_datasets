The variable 'success' is not dependent on 'amount 1 Out' in function 'swap'. The reason is that the 'safe transfer' function is called within the swap function, but the amount of the transfer is determined by the value of 'value' which is a parameter of function swap. Therefore, the success of a transfer does not depend on whether the output amount is greater than the input amount.
