Label: Unknown

Reason: The variable `y` in the function `addDelta` is a parameter to the function. Whether it is controlled by the user or not depends on how the function is called. If `addDelta` is called by another function that a user can interact with through a transaction, and the user can pass in the value for `y`, then `y` would be user-controlled. However, if `addDelta` is only called internally by the contract and the value of `y` is determined by the contract's logic without any direct user input, then `y` is not user-controlled. Since the provided code snippet does not show the context in which `addDelta` is called, we cannot determine with certainty whether `y` is controlled by the user or not. Therefore, the label is 'unknown'.
