Label: no

Reason: The variable `totalReservesNew` in the function `accrueInterest` is calculated within that function and is based on the `totalReserves` state variable, `interestAccumulated`, and `reserveFactorMantissa`. It does not have a direct data dependency on any local variables within the `repayBorrowFresh` function. The `repayBorrowFresh` function does not modify `totalReserves` or any other state variables that `totalReservesNew` depends on. It only modifies `totalBorrows` and the borrower's individual account borrow balance. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `totalReservesNew` in `accrueInterest` and any variable in `repayBorrowFresh`.
