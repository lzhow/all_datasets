   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all day. I just want to make a simple text based RPG game. Give me a list of good first steps. And maybe some exercises to do. Also, is there a website where I can practice? Or should I use an IDE? And if so, which one is best? Please reply in a easy to understand manner. Thank you.  I also want you to not only tell me what I should do, but also why you think that I shoud do it that way. For example: "I think you should use this and that to improve your skills"
