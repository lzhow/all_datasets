The contract has two mappings: `_allowance` and `_balance`. The `_transfer` function updates the `_balanace` mapping.

`_approve` does not update any mappings. 

`increaseAllownace`, `decreaseAllowence`, `_mint`, and ` _ burn` do not use the `balance` or `allownance`.
Therefore, the only function that updates `_balanceOf` is `_burn`.
