Yes

The variable `total` in the function `buyJay` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155`. The reason for this is that `total` is used to accumulate the total number of NFTs being bought, and it is directly modified by the return value of `buyJayWithERC1155`, which is the `amount` of ERC1155 tokens being bought.

In the `buyJay` function, `total` is initially set to the length of the `erc721TokenAddress` array, representing the number of ERC721 tokens being bought. Then, if there are any ERC1155 tokens to be bought (checked by `erc1155TokenAddress.length != 0`), the `total` is incremented by the return value of the `buyJayWithERC1155` function call:

```solidity
if (erc1155TokenAddress.length != 0)
    total = total.add(buyJayWithERC1155(erc1155TokenAddress, erc1155Ids, erc1155Amounts));
```

The `buyJayWithERC1155` function calculates the `amount` by summing up the `amounts` array, which represents the quantity of each ERC1155 token being bought, and then returns this value:

```solidity
function buyJayWithERC1155(
    address[] calldata _tokenAddress,
    uint256[] calldata ids,
    uint256[] calldata amounts
) internal returns (uint256) {
    uint256 amount = 0;
    for (uint256 id = 0; id < ids.length; id++) {
        amount = amount.add(amounts[id]);
        // ... other code ...
    }
    return amount;
}
```

Since `total` is directly affected by the `amount` returned from `buyJayWithERC1155`, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
