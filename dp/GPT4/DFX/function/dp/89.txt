The variable `x` in the function `inv` is not data dependent on the variable `result` in the function `exp_2`. 

Reason: The variable `x` in the function `inv` is only used as an input parameter for the function and is not modified or used in any calculations within the function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `x` and `result`.
