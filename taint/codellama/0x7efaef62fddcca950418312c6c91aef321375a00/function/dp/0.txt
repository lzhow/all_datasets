  
No, the variables ` success` and `_ token  ` are independent.

The variable` success ` is a local variable in function `_safe Transfer` that is assigned the result of calling the `call` function on a token contract. This function call is made with the arguments `to`, `value`, and `abi .encodewithselector (SELECT OR, TO, VALUE)`. The result is stored in a tuple of two elements, where the first element is `bool` indicating whether the call was successful, and the second element contains the data returned by the called function.  The variable  `_success `is not used in any other function or variable, so it is not dependent on any variable or state in other functions.   The same is true for the `_toke` variable. It is also a private variable that only appears in this function and is never used elsewhere. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions and variables.
