Reason: The variable `_token1` in the function `swap` is assigned the value of the state variable `token1`, which is set during the initialization of the contract and represents the address of one of the tokens in the pair. This initialization is performed by the `initialize` function, which can only be called by the factory contract (as enforced by the `require(msg.sender == factory, 'Pancake: FORBIDDEN');` statement). Since the factory contract is typically a trusted entity that deploys liquidity pool contracts, and not an arbitrary user, the value of `token1` is not directly controlled by the user. Once set during initialization, `_token1` remains constant and is not subject to user control during the execution of the `swap` function.
