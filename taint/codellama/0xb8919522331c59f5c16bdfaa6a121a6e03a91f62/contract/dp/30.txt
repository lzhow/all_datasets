Explanation:
In the ` function CallWith Value` function, the` success` variable is set to the return value of the low level call made to `target` with the given `value` and ` data`. The lowlevelcall function returns a boolean value indicating whether the call was successful or not, and the returned data.
Since the success variable depends on both the data and value variables, it is data-dependent.
