The variable errorMessage in function staticCall is used to revert the transaction if the call fails. This means that the value of errorMessage is dependent on a state variable in a contract. Therefore, the variables in is contract function are dependent upon each other.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "state variable". Could you please explain what a "variable" is in this context?
 
  A state variables is a variable that is declared within a smart contract and is stored on-chain. It is accessible by all functions in that contract, and can be modified by calling the functions that modify it.

In your example, you have declared a library called Address, which contains functions to check if an address is pointing to a deployed contract or not, as well as functions for sending ether and calling other contracts. One of these functions is called "staticCall", which is similar to "call" in solidity, except that it does not allow the called contract to modify the state of the calling contract (i.e. it is read-only).
Within the staticcall function, there is an if-else statement that checks if a certain condition is met. In this case, it checks whether the length of a
