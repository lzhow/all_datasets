Label: yes

Reason: The variable `repayAmount` in the function `repayBorrowAllowed` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is meant to be called from outside the contract, typically by a user interacting with the contract. The user calling this function will specify the value of `repayAmount`, which means that this variable is controlled by the user.
