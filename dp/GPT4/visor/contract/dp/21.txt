Yes

The contract state `owner` is data dependent on the variable `newOwner` in the function `transferOwnership`. This is because within the `transferOwnership` function, the state variable `owner` is directly assigned the value of the `newOwner` parameter, indicating a data dependency relationship. The assignment `owner = newOwner;` establishes that the state of `owner` will change based on the value passed to `newOwner` when `transferOwnership` is called.
