Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to progress.




I would recommend the official python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will take you through all the basics of the language. After that you can start looking for projects to work on. Good luck!
