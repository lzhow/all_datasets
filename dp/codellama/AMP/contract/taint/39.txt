  
No, the `_partiton` variable in `_removeTockenFromParition` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function `_transerByParititons` calls `_removetokenFrompartition`, and it passes the partition as a parameter, so the value of `_parition ` is determined by `_tranferbyPartititions` and is therefore not under the control of the end user, but rather the contract itself.
