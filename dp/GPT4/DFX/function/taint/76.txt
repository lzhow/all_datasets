Explanation: The variable `grossLiquidity_` in the function `getGrossLiquidityAndBalances` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the values returned by the `Assimilators.viewNumeraireBalance` function, which retrieves the balance of a specific asset. The user does not have direct control over the calculation of `grossLiquidity_`.
