  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the ` function delegateCall` function, the` success` variable is set to the result of the call expression `target. delegatecall (data)`. The call is made to a contract at the address ` target` with the data ` data`. The ` success ` variable will be set based on whether the delegate function call was successful or not. Therefore, ` Success` is data-dependent on ` Data` because the value of `Success` depends on what happens during the execution of` target . delegatecalls (Data)`.
