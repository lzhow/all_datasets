Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the result of the addition `a +b ` is greater than or equal to ` a`. If it is not, it will revert the transaction. Therefore, ` c` is data-dependent on ` b` because the value of `  c ` depends on whether the condition in ` require` evaluates to true or false.
