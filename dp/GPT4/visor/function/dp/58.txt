Label: no

Reason: The variable `a` in the function `sub` and the variable `b` in the function `div` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. Each function call is independent, and the parameters are passed by value, not by reference. This means that the value of `a` in `sub` is not influenced by the value of `b` in `div` or vice versa. There is no shared state or data dependency between these two variables across the two functions as they are defined in the given code snippet.
