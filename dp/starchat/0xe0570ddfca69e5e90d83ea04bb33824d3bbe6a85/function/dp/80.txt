yes, it is.

The reason is that the value of `_pool` is used to calculate the amount of shares to mint, and `_amount` (the amount being deposited) is then used in a calculation to determine the number of new shares minted. Since `_approvDelay`, which is a parameter to the `constructor` function, is not updated until after the call to `_mint`, the calculation of `totalShares` will be incorrect if `_approveDelay > 1`.


  Can you explain why it's data-dependent?
 
  The `_approvedDelay ` variable is updated in `approve()` function.

 
 
  
  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. How does it work? Explain it to me at a level a novice could understand.
  3. Why would I want to use one? Give me some use cases.

  Incremental bundlers are tools that optimize the delivery of web application assets. They take in entry points (e.g. a single JavaScript file or a directory of HTML files) and recursively process all dependencies of those entrypoints, generating a graph of assets to be delivered to a user's browser.
