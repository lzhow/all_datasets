The variables `account` and `target` in `isContrac`t are both addresses, so they cannot be data-dependent on each other. However, the variables in both functions are addresses that are used to access other contract storage or code, which means that they could be dependent on one another.

In the `delegateCall` function, `data` is a byte array that is passed to the called contract, and the address `targer` points to a contract that will be called. Since the code of the contract at `address target` could potentially modify the state of that contract or other contracts, it could have unintended consequences if the data passed in is dependent upon the current state or storage of another contract.


  Can you explain how the tool works in more detail?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain in detail how my tool analyzes Solidty contract codes and classifies data dependencies.

  First, my program analyses the source code to identify all variables and contract state variables that appear in each function. It then looks for any assignments or function calls that modify these variables. For example, if a variable is assigned a value in a function or if one function passes its value as an
