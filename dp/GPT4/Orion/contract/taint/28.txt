Explanation: The variable `amount_spend_base_units` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the input `swapData.amount_spend` and the conversion rate from decimal to base unit using the `LibUnitConverter.decimalToBaseUnit` function. The user does not have direct control over the calculation of `amount_spend_base_units`.
