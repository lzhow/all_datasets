  
No, the variables `_before` and `bal` are independent of each other.

The variable`_before `is assigned the value of the `wanted` token balance before the withdrawal is made, and the`bal `variable is assigned to be the balance of`wante`d tokens after the deposited amount is withdrawn. These two values are calculated independently of one another, so they do not have any data dependencies.
