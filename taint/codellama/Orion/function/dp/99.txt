  
No, the variables ` token Index` and ` to Auto` are independent.

The variable  `TokenIndex ` is defined in function `do Swap Through Orin Pool` as a local variable and is not passed as an argument to the `_ do Swaptokenn` function. Therefore, it is independent of the `ToAuto ` variable, which is also a function-local variable in `_doswap Tokens`.
