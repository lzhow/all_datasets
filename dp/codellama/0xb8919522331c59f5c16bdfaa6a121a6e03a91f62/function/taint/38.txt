  
The variable 'new Implementation' in function '_upgrateToandCall' is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the ' new Implementaion' variable is passed as an argument to the '_set Implemenation' function, which is a private function that is only accessible within the contract. Therefore, the value of 'New Implmentation ' is set by a user-controlled function and is therefore controlled  by user .
