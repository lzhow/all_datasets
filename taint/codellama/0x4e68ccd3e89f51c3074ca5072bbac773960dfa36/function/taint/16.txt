The variable 'cardinailtyNext' is a local variable in function 'initialize' which is defined as a function parameter. It is passed as an argument to the 'grow' function, which modifies its value. However, the value of 'caridnalityNext is never directly modified by any user input. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled only by internal logic and not by user inputs.
