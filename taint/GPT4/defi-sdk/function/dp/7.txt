Reason: The variable `amountsIn` in the function `getAmountsIn` is data dependent on the variable `reserveIn` in the function `getAmountIn` because `amountsIn` is being assigned values based on the output of `getAmountIn` function calls within a loop. The `getAmountIn` function calculates `amountIn` using `reserveIn` (along with other variables), and this calculated value is then used to populate the `amountsIn` array at the corresponding index. Since `amountsIn` is directly affected by the values returned from `getAmountIn`, and `getAmountIn`'s return value is dependent on `reserveIn`, there is a data dependency relationship between `amountsIn` and `reserveIn`.
