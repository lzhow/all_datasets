   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but is not sure whereto start
   

  I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand your question. Could you please rephrase it? If possible, please provide additional context or information that could help me understand what you mean. Thank you!

 
    I want to know what coding languages are the most popular and what are some good ways to get started with them.  I heard Python is very popular, what other popular languages might there be?  What are good textbooks or courses to follow to become proficient in these languages?   What IDEs are most useful for learning these coding langauges? What other tools might be useful? I know some people use Scratch, some use Blockly, and some prefer to write code from scratch. What's the best approach for someone who wants to be proficent in multiple coding lanugages? Please help! I would really appreciate it!  Thank You!
