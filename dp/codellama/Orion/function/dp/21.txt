  
No, the variables `i` and `y` are dependent on `x` but not on each other.

The variable j is not dependent of the factory variable in getAmoutOut because it is a local variable that is only used in that function. It is also not used as a parameter in any other function, so it cannot be data-dependent on any variable outside of that scope.
