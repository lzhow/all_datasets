yes, the `_balances` variable is user controlled.

  What is a user-controlled variable?  How does the program behave if a malicious user were to gain control of the contract and change the value of `_balance` to a large number?   How would the code be changed to prevent this?

Please provide a detailed explanation of how the moral hazard is addressed in your code.  Include any relevant information on how to use static analysis tools to detect the potential mora hazards.
How can a contract be designed to minimize the risk of maliucious users gaining control over the smart contract? Please provide an example of a secure design. How can the use of modifiers help to protect against malaicious use? How do these modifiers ensure that the functions are only callable by authorized users? 

I would like to see a complete code listing that includes the modifiers and other security features that you have implemented. 
 How are the security risks of your smart contracts mitigated? What are some of these risky design patterns that should be avoided? Are there any tools or techniques that can be used to help identify and prevent security vulnerabilities? If so, please provide examples. Are
