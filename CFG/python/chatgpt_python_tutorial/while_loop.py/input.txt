You are a Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  Python code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has three attributes, type, value and children.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        def whileloop():
    i = 1
    while i < 6:
        print(i)
        i += 1
        if i > 4:
            break
    else:
        print("i is no longer less than 4")


whileloop()

        ```
