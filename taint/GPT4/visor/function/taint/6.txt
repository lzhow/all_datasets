Label: yes

Reason: The variable `snapshotId` in the function `totalSupplyAt` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `public`, it can be called by anyone outside of the contract, including users. Therefore, the value of `snapshotId` is controlled by the user who calls the function, as they can pass in any `uint256` value as an argument.
