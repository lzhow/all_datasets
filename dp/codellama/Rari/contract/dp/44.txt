  
No, the variables ` comp Accru_ ` and ` hold_ers ` are independent.

The variable  `CompAcc_rude_  is defined in function  update Comp Supply Index, and it is used to calculate the amount of comp to be distributed to supporters. It is calculated based on  the current comp supply index and the number of blocks that have passed since the last update.  The variable is only used within the scope of the  function, so it cannot be affected by the value of  hold _ers  outside of that function.
