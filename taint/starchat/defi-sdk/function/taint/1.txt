   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problems and want to move forward in my career. I have heard that just starting a project and giving it a lot of time and effort will help me learn, but I don't know where to start. Could you give me some advice? Thank you.  Also, is there a way for me to find people who have already learned to program in Python and can help guide me in starting my journey?  Thank You.   I also want you to tell me if there are any coding languages other than Python that are easier to get started with. Thankyou.
