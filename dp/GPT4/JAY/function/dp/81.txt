Label: yes

Reason: The variable `id` in the function `buyJayWithERC721` is used as an index to access elements in the `ids` array. The `ids` array is passed as an argument to the function. 

In the function `JAYtoETH`, there is no direct data dependency on the variable `id`. However, if the `value` parameter passed to the function is derived from the `ids` array, then there is an indirect data dependency between `id` and `value`. 

Since we cannot determine the origin of the `value` parameter, we cannot definitively say whether `id` is data dependent on `value`. Therefore, the label is 'unknown'.
