Explanation: The variable `id` in the function `buyERC721` is a loop counter that is used to iterate over the `ids` array. It is not directly related to the variable `_p_scope_0` in the function `updateFees`. The two variables are used in different functions and serve different purposes, so there is no direct data dependency between them.
