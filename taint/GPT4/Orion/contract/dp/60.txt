In the Solidity code provided, there are multiple functions named `sub` within the `SafeMath` library that perform subtraction. The variable `a` in the function `sub` is data dependent on the variable `b` in the same function `sub` because the result of the subtraction operation `a - b` directly depends on the values of both `a` and `b`. The subtraction cannot be performed without knowing both operands, and the outcome of the operation will change if either `a` or `b` changes. Additionally, there is a requirement check `require(b <= a, "SafeMath: subtraction overflow");` which also establishes a data dependency as the execution of the function depends on the relationship between `a` and `b`.
