   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

Here are some steps you can follow to get started with Python:

1. Choose a development environment: You can write Python code on any text editor or IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text. However, to run and debug your code, you'll need a Python interpreter. Popular options include the built-in Python Interpreter in Visual Studios Code and the IDLE (Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment) available on most platforms.

2. Learn the basics: To start writing Python, it's important to have an understanding of the basic syntax and data structures. Start with basic data types, control structures, functions, and classes. This can be done through tutorials, books, online courses, etc. Some good places to start include:
