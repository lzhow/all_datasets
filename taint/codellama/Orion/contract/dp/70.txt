  
No, the ` factory` contract variable is not dependent on ` amounts` variable in function ` _ swap`.

The ` amount` array is a local variable that is created within the `_ swap` function and is only used within that function. It is never passed as an argument to any other function or stored in any contract storage. Therefore, it is considered a private variable and does not affect the data dependencies of the other contract variables.
