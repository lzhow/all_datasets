Label: no

Reason: The variable `errorMessage` in the function `functionDelegateCall` and the variable `data` in the function `functionCall` are parameters of their respective functions. Each function's parameters are scoped to that function and do not have a data dependency relationship with parameters of other functions unless they are passed as arguments or there is some shared state that connects them. In this case, there is no shared state or argument passing between `functionCall` and `functionDelegateCall` that would create a data dependency between `data` and `errorMessage`. Each function operates independently, and the parameters are used within their own function scope.
