The variable rate slope 2 is a public variable in a smart contract. It is defined in line 10 of the code.  It can be changed by anyone who has access to the contract's address. Therefore, the rate of interest is unpredictable and can change at any time. This is because the value of rate Slope  is determined by a user-defined variable.
