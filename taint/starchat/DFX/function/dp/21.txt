The function is a complex one, but I'll do my best to explain what I know.

First, the `unknown` label is given to the variables `amt_`, `oGLik_`,`nGLike_`.
`amt_` is used to store the amount of the asset that is swapped. It is calculated as the difference between the balances of `_input` and `_output` assets. Since it is an internal variable, it does not affect the state of any contract. Therefore, its value can be safely discarded.  `nGliq_` and `ogli_` are used in calculations to determine the value of GLiQ. However, since they depend on `assets` array, which is also unknown, their values cannot be determined.
