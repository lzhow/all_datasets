Label: unknown

Reason: The provided Solidity function `repayByAmount` does not contain enough information to determine if there is a data dependency relationship between the contract state `userPoolData` and the variable `_amount`. The function takes `_amount` and uses it to calculate `repayShare` through the `calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmount` function. Then, it calls `repayInternal` with `_token` and `repayShare`. However, without the implementation details of `calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmount`, `repayInternal`, and the possible effects of the modifiers `nonReentrant`, `updatePoolWithInterestsAndTimestamp`, and `updateAlphaReward`, it is impossible to determine if `userPoolData` is modified or read in a way that depends on `_amount`. Therefore, the relationship is labeled as 'unknown'.
