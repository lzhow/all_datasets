In the `isContract` function, the only variable that is used is `size`, which is a local variable declared in that function. It is not dependent on any other variable or state in any way.
On the other hand, in `SendValue` the variables `recipient` and `amount` are used. However, these variables are passed as arguments to the internal function and are therefore not considered to be data-dependent on each other.
