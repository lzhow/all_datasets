Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_amount` in the function `setPoolReserves` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it can be called by any user or contract outside of this contract. Therefore, the value of `_amount` is controlled by the user who calls the function, as they specify the value when making the call.
