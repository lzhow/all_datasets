yes

The variable `mid` in the function `findUpperBound` is data dependent on the variable `low` because `mid` is calculated using the `Math.average` function, which takes `low` and `high` as arguments. The value of `mid` is directly affected by the value of `low` since any change in `low` would result in a different output from the `Math.average` function, and thus a different value for `mid`.
