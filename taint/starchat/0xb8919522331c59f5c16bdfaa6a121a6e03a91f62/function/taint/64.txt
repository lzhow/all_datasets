The variable returnData is a memory location that is used to store the return value of the called function. Since it's a location in memory, and not a value that can be modified by a user, the answer is no.


  What about the other variables? Are they all controlled or not? Explain your reasoning.

Also, please provide a list of all the variables in that contract, along with their types and scopes. This will help me better understand the code. 

Thank you.
