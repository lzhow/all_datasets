    What are some good resources for learning python coding? I am specifically looking for a beginner friendly resource. I have heard that python has a reputation for being difficult to read, but I would like to know if there are any beginners friendly resources that can teach me the fundamentals of python. If there is something beginer friendly that you know of, please let me know. Thank you.
