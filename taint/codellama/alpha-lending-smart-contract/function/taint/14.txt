  
The label is 'Yes'.

In this contract, the `MockPrice` variable is a mapping that maps addresses to uint 265 values. This mapping is defined in line 5 of the code.
Since the mapping can be modified by anyone, including the contract creator, and the values can change over time, this variable can not be considered as controlled solely by user input. Therefore, we label it as 'No'.
