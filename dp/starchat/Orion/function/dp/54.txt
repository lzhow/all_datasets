   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
   
    An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web application by combining multiple files into a single file. This reduces the number of requests made to the server and improves the overall performance.
   
    What are some of the most popular incremental bundle tools? And what are their pros and cons? Please provide some examples for each tool. Also, what is considered a good practice for using an incremental tool? For example, should I use a tool if the project is small, or if it is just a personal project? What about if I am working on a large project with many developers? Is there a balance point where the tool becomes less useful? How do I know when to use one over another? I would appreciate it if you could provide a comprehensive comparison of all the tools, with pro and contra examples, and best practices. Thank you.
