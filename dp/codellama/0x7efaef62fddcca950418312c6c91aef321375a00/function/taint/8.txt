  
No, the ` balance  ` variable in function `_update` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is assigned the value of `I ERC ​​2  token  _ token  1 . balance Of ( address ( this ) )` , which is a function call that returns the balance of the token in this contract.

The balance is determined by how much of each token is stored in  the contract, and it cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it depends on the actions of other users in relation to the smart contract and the tokens stored within it.
