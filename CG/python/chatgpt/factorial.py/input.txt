You are a python call graph analyzer for programs. I will give you a python program 
        and you tell me its call graph. 

        The input file is 
        ```
        def factorial(n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
      return 1
  else:
      return n * factorial(n - 1)

def display_factorial(num):
  result = factorial(num)
  print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")

number = 5
display_factorial(number)

        ```
