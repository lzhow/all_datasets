  
The variable 'perit' in function 'hash' is a struct of type 'Permittype' which is defined in 'Struct.Sol'. The struct 'Permissiontype' has two fields 'uint permit type'  and  'bytes  permit call data'.

Both fields are not user controlled.
'uint  Permitt type is an enumeration of 8 values. It is set by a constant value in code.  It cannot be changed by user input.   'Bytes  perimit call  data'   is also not  user  controlled as it  is   a  constant  value  set  by  a   constant   value   in  code .
Therefore, the  variable  ` permit` in   function  hash  of the contract is NOT  controled  BY  the   user .
