Reason: The variable `sqrtPX96` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromInput` and the variable `sqrtRatioAX96` in the function `getAmount0Delta` are function parameters that are independent of each other. There is no direct relationship or computation in the provided code snippet that indicates `sqrtPX96` is derived from or affects `sqrtRatioAX96`. Each function operates independently, and the variables are scoped to their respective functions. Without additional context or code showing interaction between these functions, we cannot establish a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
