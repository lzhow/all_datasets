  
The variable 'cTokes' in mintAllwed is a parameter of the external function. It is passed as an argument to the mint allowed function and is therefore not a variable that is defined within the contract. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In the code, ctoken is an input parameter to mintallowed. This means that the value of ctokens is determined by whoever calls the method. Since the caller of mint Allowed is responsible for passing the c token value, this value is under the control of a user and therefore the response is no.
