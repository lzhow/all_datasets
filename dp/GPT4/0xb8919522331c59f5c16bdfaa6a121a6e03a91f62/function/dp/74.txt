There is no direct data dependence between the variables ` data` and ` success` because they belong to different functions. However, the ` function staticCall` function is called within the body of the`functionCall `, and the return value of `staticCall`, which is `returddata`, is used as an argument to the `_verifycallResult` internal function. Therefore, ` returrdda` is indirectly dependent on `sucess`.
