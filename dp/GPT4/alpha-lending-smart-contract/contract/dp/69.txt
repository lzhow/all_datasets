Label: no

Reason: The variable `_totalBorrows` in the function `setPool` is used to set the `totalBorrows` property of a `Pool` struct instance associated with a specific ERC20 token. This variable is independent of the `_amount` variable in the function `giveAlphaToAlToken`. The `_amount` in `giveAlphaToAlToken` is used to approve and then provide an amount of alpha tokens to the `alToken` associated with the ERC20 token. There is no direct code path or logical connection in the provided code snippet that indicates `_totalBorrows` is affected by or affects `_amount`. They are used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions, and there is no shared state or computation that would create a data dependency between them.
