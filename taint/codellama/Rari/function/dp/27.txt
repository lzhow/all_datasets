  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `function drips()`, the value of ` drippped` is updated by adding the result of the expression `add( drippeed, to drips_, 'tauto-logical')` to it. This expression is calculated by subtracting the current value `delta dripe` from the total amount of dripping ` d ripTotal`. The value for ` delta dripes` depends on `block. number` and `drpStart`, so `driveped ` is data-dependent on` drpstart_`.
