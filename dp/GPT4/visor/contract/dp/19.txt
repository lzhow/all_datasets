yes

The variable `r` in the function `recover` is directly extracted from the `signature` variable using inline assembly. The line `r := mload(add(signature, 0x20))` shows that `r` is assigned a portion of the data from `signature`, starting at an offset of 32 bytes (0x20 in hexadecimal) from the beginning of `signature`. This indicates that `r` is data dependent on `signature` because its value is determined by reading the contents of `signature`.
