  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `target` variable is passed as an argument to the `_verifycallResult` function, which is called after the staticcall function. This means that the success variable in `verify_call_result` is dependent on `returdata`, which in turn is a function of `static_cal` and `errorMessage`. Therefore, `sucess` depends on data.
