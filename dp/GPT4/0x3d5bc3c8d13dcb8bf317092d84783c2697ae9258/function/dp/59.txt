Label: no

Reason: The variable `redeemTokens` in the function `redeemInternal` and the variable `seizeTokens` in the function `seize` are not data dependent because they are defined in separate functions and there is no interaction or shared state between these two functions that would establish a data dependency. Each function operates independently, and the variables are scoped to their respective functions. There is no code in the provided snippet that passes the value of `seizeTokens` to `redeemInternal` or vice versa. Therefore, changes to `seizeTokens` will not affect `redeemTokens` and changes to `redeemTokens` will not affect `seizeTokens`.
