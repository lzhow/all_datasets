Label: no

Reason: The variable `denominator` in the function `getAmountIn` is calculated using the variables `reserveOut` and `amountOut`. It does not use the variable `reserveIn` in its calculation. The line that defines `denominator` is:

```solidity
uint256 denominator = (reserveOut - amountOut) * 997;
```

As we can see, `denominator` is dependent on `reserveOut` and `amountOut`, but not on `reserveIn`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `denominator` and `reserveIn` within the `getAmountIn` function.
