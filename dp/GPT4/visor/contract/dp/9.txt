In the `tryMul` function of the provided Solidity code, the variable `c` is directly calculated by multiplying the input variable `a` with another input variable `b` (`uint256 c = a * b;`). This establishes a data dependency relationship between `c` and `a` within the `tryMul` function, as the value of `c` is determined by the value of `a` and `b`. If the value of `a` changes, it will directly affect the value of `c`, assuming `b` remains constant. Therefore, `c` is data dependent on `a` in the context of the `tryMul` function.
