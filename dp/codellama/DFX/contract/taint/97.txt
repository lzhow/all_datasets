  
No, the `ON` variable is a constant and is defined as `0 x 1 6 4 2 9 5 3 7 8 `. It is therefore not user-controlled.

The `viewProporional` function is an external function that takes a `Storage` object and a `_depoist` as input. It then calls the internal `getGrosLiuqidtyAndBala` and `intakNumaraire` functions to calculate the proportional deposit and mint new tokens. However, since the `_oGliq` is calculated using the external `Assilator` library, which is also not under the control of the contract, this variable cannot be controlled directly by a user and therefore is labeled as 'No'.
