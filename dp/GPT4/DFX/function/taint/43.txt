Explanation: The variable `alpha_` in the function `viewCurve` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the value of `curve.alpha.mulu(1e18)`, which is a property of the `curve` storage variable. The `curve` storage variable is not controlled by the user as it is a part of the contract's internal state. Therefore, the variable `alpha_` is not controlled by the user.
