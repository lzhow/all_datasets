In the given code, the `_authorizedUpgrades` mapping is used to store the addresses of the authorized contracts that can upgrade the implementation. This mapping can be modified by any user who has the permission to upgrade.
However, in this case, `_upgrateTo` function is called with the `newImplentation` address as an argument, which is passed to the internal `_authroizeupgrad` method.  This method checks if `msg.sender` is an authorised upgrade contract and if so, sets the value of `_implementationSlot` to `address(0)`.
Therefore, while the address of ` _implementation_slot` can change, its value is determined by an external contract, and it cannot be controlled directly by a user, so the answer is No.
