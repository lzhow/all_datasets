  
No, the `partionsOf` variable is a public mapping that is defined in a contract and is therefore controlled directly by that contract. It is publicly accessible and can be read or written by anyone, but it cannot be modified by a user directly.

The reason for this is that the contract has full control over the mapping and its contents, and it can modify the values stored in it at any time. Therefore, from the perspective of a smart contract, this variable can only be considered as controlled indirectly by users, through the actions of the smart contact itself.
