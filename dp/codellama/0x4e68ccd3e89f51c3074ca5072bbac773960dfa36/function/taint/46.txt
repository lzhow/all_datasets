The variable 'twows' is a local variable in function 'mulDiv' which is defined as a constant. It is assigned a value of -'denomintor' & 'denoninator' using bitwise AND operator. This value is calculated based on the input parameters 'a' , 'b'  and  ' denominatior' but it does not depend on any user input.
