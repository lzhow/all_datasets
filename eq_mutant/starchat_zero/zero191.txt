In the case of the given two code snippets, I would need more contextual information to determine whether or not they would be considered semantic equivalent. For example, are the functions `Profit` and `abs` meant to be equivalent or are they simply different functions? Furthermore, is the input data for the function `profit` always the exact same value or is it possible for it to vary depending on some other factor? Without additional context, it is not possible to accurately assess the equivalence of these two snippets of code.
