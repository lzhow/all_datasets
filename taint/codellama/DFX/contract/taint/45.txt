  
No, the `_cruvesBurnt` variable in emergenyWithDraw is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function `emergencyWithraw` takes in a parameter `_crvesburnt`, which is a user-supplied value. This means that the value of `_currvesburn` is determined by a malicious user, and it can be used to manipulate the contract' s behavior. Therefore, we label it as 'Yes' (controlled by User).
