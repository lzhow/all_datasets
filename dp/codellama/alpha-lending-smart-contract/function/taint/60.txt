  
The variable `OPTMALUTILISATIONRATER` in function `getOptimaUtilisationRate` is a constant variable. It is defined as a public variable in line 20 and assigned a value of 80% of the total supply of WAD tokens. Therefore, the value is determined by a user and is considered controlled.

In the context of smart contracts, variables are considered to be controlled if they are determined at the time of deployment and cannot be changed by any user or external entity. In this case, `OPTOIMAUTLIISATIOINRR` cannot change after deployment, so it can be considered as controlled variable by user
