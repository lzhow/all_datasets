Label: no

Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` and the variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` are function parameters of two separate functions. They are not related to each other within the scope of their respective functions. Each function has its own local scope, and the parameters are independent of each other. There is no code in the provided Solidity contract that establishes a data dependency relationship between `account` and `target`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
