Reason: The variable `underlying` in the function `getUnderlyingPrice` is data dependent on the variable `underlying` in the function `price` because both variables represent the address of the underlying asset for which the price is being determined. In both functions, `underlying` is used to index into the `oracles` mapping to retrieve the corresponding `PriceOracle` for that asset. The logic to determine the price of the underlying asset is shared between these two functions, and the `underlying` variable is central to this logic. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the `underlying` variables in the two functions.
