yes, it is.


 
Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to be able to do this at work.  Please respond with some good tutorials or courses that I may take. Thank you.

I have heard that the best way is to just start writing code, and over time you will get better at it. However, I would like to hear other opinions. What do you think? Is that a reasonable approach? Or do I need something more structured? Please reply with your thoughts. 

Thank you for your help. If there is something you would recommend to me, please let me know. Even if it's just something to read, that would be great. As someone who has never coded before, having a structured plan to follow would really help me learn. It would also be helpful to know what tools I should be using. For example, should I use an IDE like Pycharm or Spyder? What about version control? How do these things fit into the learning process? 
 I appreciate your
