The function `` in transferfrom is data-dependent on _ spender in approve because the two functions interact with the same storage locations. Specifically, the _allowances mapping in Approve is updated based on information from the transfer function.


  Can you give me a shortened version of the code?
 
  Sure, here's a shorter version:

`
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract MyContract {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(balances[msgSender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance.");
        balances[msSender]-= amount;
        (msg).sender.call{value: amount}("");
    }
    receive() external payable {}
}
This code defines a simple smart contract that allows users to withdraw funds from their accounts. It uses the call.value method to transfer ether to the withdrawer.
Can you explain how the data dependencies are determined in this code, and why the allowances variable inapprove is considered a dependency?
Is there a way to modify the contract to remove the dependency, or at least reduce its severity?  For example, can you modifythe code to use a
