In the Solidity code provided, the variable `returndata` in the function `functionDelegateCall` is data dependent on the variable `target`. This is because `returndata` is the result of the delegate call made to the address specified by `target`. The delegate call is executed with the following line of code:

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.delegatecall(data);
```

Here, `target` is the address to which the delegate call is being made, and `data` is the payload of the call. The result of this call, which includes whether the call was successful (`success`) and the return data (`returndata`), is directly influenced by the address `target`. If the address `target` changes, the outcome of the delegate call, and thus the contents of `returndata`, could also change. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `returndata` and `target` within the `functionDelegateCall` function.
