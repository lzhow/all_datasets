In the `getUserAccout` function, the local variable  `compoundLiuqidtyBalanc` is calculated based on `pool.alphaMutiplyer` and `borrowerShare`. The `alphaMultipler` variable is not directly related to the  variable`userPooldata`in the`calculatAlphaReard`function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
