  How do I fix the code? I am a beginner
 
  The code you provided is written in Solidty, a programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Solidit is a high-level language that is designed to be easy to read and write, but it can also be difficult to debug and maintain. Here are some tips to help you fix your code:

1. Use proper indentation and spacing: Solidiy uses indentation to define scope and structure, so it's important to make sure that your indentation is consistent and follows the rules of the language.

2. Comment your Code: It's a good idea to add comments to your Solidi code to explain what each line of code does. This will make it easier to understand and debug your contract.

Here's an example of how your smart contract might look after you've added comments:
