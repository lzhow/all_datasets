Label: no

Reason: The variable `bAdjusted` in the function `lte` is calculated based on the parameters `time`, `a`, and `b`. It does not have any direct or indirect relationship with the variable `secondsAgo` in the function `observeSingle`. The `secondsAgo` variable is used in `observeSingle` to calculate a `target` timestamp and is involved in the logic to retrieve and calculate observation data, but it is not passed to or used in the `lte` function, nor does it influence the calculation of `bAdjusted` within that function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `bAdjusted` and `secondsAgo`.
