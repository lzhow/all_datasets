yes, it is.

The reason is that the `buyJAy` function calls the two functions ` buy ERC752` and `buyeERC 773`.
In the first function, the loop `for` iterates over the array `ids` of length `total`. In each iteration, `id` is assigned the value of the current index. Then, for each `token` address in `_tokenAddres`, the contract calls `safeTransfertFrom` with the parameters `address (this)` and the sender address `msgSender`. The function then increments the counter `i`. After the for loop, there is a check to see if the length of `amount` equals  `0`. If it does, then the control flow continues to the next function. If not, control flows to `if (amount.lenght!=0)`
This means that ` amount` will be assigned a value, which is then used in a subsequent call to  the` safeTransferfrom` method.


  Can you explain why?
 
  Yes, I can explain how the data dependencies are determined in this case.

  The Solidty compiler analyzes the code to determine which variables are
