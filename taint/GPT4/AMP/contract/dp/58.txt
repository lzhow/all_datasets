Yes

The variable `_value` in the function `approveByPartition` is data dependent on the variable `_addedValue` in the function `increaseAllowanceByPartition`. The reason for this data dependency is that `increaseAllowanceByPartition` calls `_approveByPartition` internally, passing a new value that is the sum of `_addedValue` and the current allowance (retrieved by `_allowedByPartition[defaultPartition][msg.sender][_spender].add(_addedValue)`). This sum is then assigned to `_value` within `_approveByPartition`, which is the same `_value` parameter used in `approveByPartition` when it calls `_approveByPartition`. Thus, the value being approved in `approveByPartition` can be influenced by the `_addedValue` passed to `increaseAllowanceByPartition`.
