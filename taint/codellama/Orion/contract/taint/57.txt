In this case, the `tryDiv` function is a library function that is part of the SaferMath contract. It is used to perform safe mathematical operations, such as division, without the risk of overflow or underflow.
However, since the input parameters `uint a` and `b` are not explicitly declared as user-controlled, we cannot determine whether they are controlled or not. Therefore, in this specific case the answer is unknown.
