  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `eth` variable is calculated using the value parameter.
Then, `msg` is called with the eth value.  The `dev` address is also called in this function with a value that is a fraction of the original ` eth` value, which is dependent on ` value`.
Therefore, in both functions, success 2 is data-dependent on value because it is used to calculate the amount of ETH to send to the dev address.
