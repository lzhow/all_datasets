Label: No

Reason: The variable `amount1` in the `burn` function is not directly controlled by the user. It is calculated within the function based on the contract's state and the amount of liquidity tokens (`liquidity`) that the caller is trying to burn. The calculation is as follows:

```solidity
amount1 = liquidity.mul(balance1) / _totalSupply;
```

Here, `liquidity` is the amount of liquidity tokens that the caller of the function has sent to the contract for burning. `balance1` is the contract's balance of `token1`, and `_totalSupply` is the total supply of liquidity tokens. While the user initiates the burn transaction and decides how many liquidity tokens to burn, the resulting `amount1` is determined by the contract's current balance and total supply, not by the user's direct input. Therefore, the user does not have direct control over the value of `amount1`.
