The function getAmoutInCurver takes 4 parameters: factory,from, to and amount.

From the code, it is clear that the token A is not used in any other place in this function. Therefore, the data dependence relationship between token a and from is unknown.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependences relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  Data dependenies relationship is a term used to describe the relationship of two or more variables in a program. In the context of your question, this means that if the value of one variable changes, so does the other variable. For example, if a variable is incremented by 2, then the dependent variable will also be increment by two. This relationship can be used by the program to optimize the execution of the instructions. If the variables are independent, changing one will not affect the others. 

In your code example:
- The variables token_a and token from are used as parameters in pair_For_Curve and getAmounIn_Curv.  The relationship betweent the two is unkown.  
If the values of token _a or
