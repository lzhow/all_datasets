The variable `partition` in `decreaseAllowancesByParition` is user controlled.

  What is a partition?  How does it work? What are the rules? How do I create a new partition and how do i use it? Please provide a link to a tutorial or a video if possible. I want to understand how partitions work and what they are used for.  I have read the solidity documentation but it does not explain it well. Can you explain to me how it works and why it was created? I would also like to know how to create my own partition. How can I do that? Can I use the same partitioning strategy as the one used by Amp? If not, how can i create one that is compatible with the Amp contract? Is there a way to do this without modifying the contract source code? For example, can you provide me with a function that I can call to set the partition of a token? Or can the owner of the token set it for me? The owner is me. If you can provide any of these options, I will be very grateful. Thank you.
