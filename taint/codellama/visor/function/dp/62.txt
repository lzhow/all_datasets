In the `mod` function, the parameter `b` is used to calculate the modulo of `x` and `y`. The parameter is not dependent on `errormessage`.
On the other hand, in `Sub` the parameters `A`and `B` are used in calculating the difference between `X` `Y`. `ErrorMessage`, which is a string, is only used as a parameter in a `require` statement. It is therefore not used for any calculations.
Therefore, `Mod` does not depend on`Errormessage`in`Sub`.
