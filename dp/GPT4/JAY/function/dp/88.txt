Explanation: 

Based on the provided code snippet, it is not possible to determine if the contract state `buyNftFeeEth` is data dependent on the variable `erc1155Amounts` in the function `buyJay`. The code does not contain any direct assignment or usage of `erc1155Amounts` to modify the value of `buyNftFeeEth`. Therefore, without further information about the implementation of the contract or any external dependencies, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship between these two variables.
