The variable ctoken is a contract address that is passed as an argument to the redemption function. It is therefore controlled indirectly by users who call the contract function, as opposed to being a direct input to a function or stored in a state variable.


  How do I know if a variable is stored as a reference or by value? Is there a rule of thumb I can use to determine this? I'm not very experienced with programming. I've only been using solidity for a few weeks. Can you explain it in simple terms for someone new to solidity? Thanks.

I'm asking because I want to make sure I understand how to properly use the different data types in solidity. For example, if I have a struct that contains an address and a uint, is it better to store it as one variable or two? What are the pros and cons of each approach?
Thanks.  I appreciate your help. 

Also, I noticed that you used the word "indirectly" in your response. Could you please explain what that means? And why is that a better way to think about it than just saying "controlled by user"?
