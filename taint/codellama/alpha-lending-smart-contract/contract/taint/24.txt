The variable _`baseborrowrate` is a public variable in `DefaultPoolconfiguration` contract. It is initialized in constructor function with the value passed as an argument. Therefore, the initial value of `_` baseborrorate`is controlledby theuser. However, once the contract is deployed, any changes to the `_ base borrow rate` variable will be controlled only by functions in`Default Pool Configuration`contract, and not by users.
