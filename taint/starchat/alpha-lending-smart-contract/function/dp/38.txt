   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it.
   

  What are some good ways to become good with Python? I've heard that it's important to practice a lot, but how do you know when you've really learned something? What's the most efficient way of improving your skills? Are there any tools or techniques you can use to make the learning process easier? Please respond in bullet point format.

I've been told to just "learn Python", but I'm terrified. I don't want to be like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/3xj66t/i_am_a_beginner_looking_for_help_on_how_to_be/
What can I do to stop feeling like that?
Please help me. This is important.
