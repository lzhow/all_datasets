  
The variable 'answerInround' in function 'updateFeess' is not dependent on variable '' in 'getlatestPrice' because the 'latestroundData' function is called in both functions, but the variables 'roundID', price', and'answerdIn Round' are only used in'updatefees'. Therefore, the data in these variables is only updated in this function, and the other function does not depend on it.

Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is 'No'.
