  
The variable ctokenBorrowed in function SeizeAllwed is a parameter of the contract. It is passed as an argument to the seizAllow function. Therefore, the value of ctokentBorrwed can be controlled  by a user who calls the SeizAllowed function, but it cannot be changed by any other function in this contract, and it does not have any state.

Therefore, we can label the ctokeBorned variable as 'No' because it can only be set by calling the  SeiseAllowd function and cannot change its value.
