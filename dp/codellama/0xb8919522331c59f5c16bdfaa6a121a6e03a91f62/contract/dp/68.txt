  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `Proxy` contract, the `_implementation()` function returns the address of the current implementation contract. In the context of this question, we are interested in whether the implementation address is data-dependent on `TransparantUpgrateableproxy`.
Since the proxy contract is a transparent proxy that delegates all calls to the underlying implementation and the logic contract address can be changed by the admin, it is possible that the data returned by `_getimplementation` can change over time.
Therefore, in this case, `implementation_` is indeed data depend on `_proxy`, and we can conclude that yes, there is an data dependence relationship between the two.
