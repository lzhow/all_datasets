Reason: The variable `mathErr` in the function `accrueInterest` is used to capture the result of mathematical operations within that function. It is a local variable scoped within the `accrueInterest` function and is used to handle errors that may occur during the calculation of interest rates, block deltas, and other arithmetic operations.

On the other hand, the variable `error` in the function `_setReserveFactor` is used to capture the return value of the `accrueInterest` function call. It is also a local variable scoped within the `_setReserveFactor` function and is used to determine if the `accrueInterest` function completed successfully before proceeding with setting the new reserve factor.

Since `mathErr` is used within `accrueInterest` for local error handling and `error` is used within `_setReserveFactor` to capture the success or failure of the `accrueInterest` call, there is no direct data dependency between `mathErr` and `error`. They are independent variables used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions.
