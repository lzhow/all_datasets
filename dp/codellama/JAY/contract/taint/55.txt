  
No, the `_address` variable in buy Jay With ER C7 7 is a private variable and is therefore not under the control of the end user, and the value is set in a constructor function.

The variable is used to store the address of an ER77 token contract, which is passed as an argument to the buy function, but it cannot be changed by an end-user. Therefore, this variable cannot control the contract.
