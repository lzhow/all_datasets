Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.\nHere are the steps to follow to install Python on your system:\n1. Download Python from the official website. Python 3 is now the latest version, Python2 is no longer maintained.\n\n2. Install Python: Once you have downloaded Python, you need to run the installer to set up Python in your computer. Most Python installers include an option to add Python to the PATH environment variable, which allows you to access Python directly from"
