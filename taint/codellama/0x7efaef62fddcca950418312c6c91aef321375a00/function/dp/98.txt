  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `function getreserves()` is a public function that returns three variables: `_Reserve 0`, `_ Reserve 1`, and `_block Timestamp Last`. The function is marked as a `view` function, which means it does not modify the state of the smart contract.
However, in this function's body, there are three assignments: ` _Reserver0` is assigned to `Reserv0`; ` Reservoir1 ` is given to `_ Reserve`; and `blockTimestamplast`is assigned `_ block Timestmaplast`.
These assignations indicate that the values of ` reservoire0 `, ` reserve  `1 and` blockTimstamlast` are dependent on each other. Therefore, we can conclude that ` Reserve1 is data-dependent on` _ Reserve `in the` get Reserves ` function.
