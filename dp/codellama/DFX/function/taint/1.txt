  
The variable curveID in function `newCurves` is labeled as 'No'.

This is because the `keccack245` function is used to generate the curve ID, which is a hash of the base currency and quote currency addresses. This means that the value of ` curveid` cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it depends on the values of other variables.
