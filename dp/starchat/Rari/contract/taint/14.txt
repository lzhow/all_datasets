yes, the `supplySpeed` and `compSupplierSpeed[msgSender]` variables in `distributeSupplierReward` are controlled, as they are set by `_setSupplyRewardSpeed()` and `_setUserSupplyCompensationSpeed()`, respectively.

The `cBorrow` variable in `_updateBorrowReward()` is also controlled. It is set in two places:
1. In `_addBorrowMarket()`, which is only called by `addMarket()` in Comp.t. and only by admin. This means that the Comp distribution contract has full control over the borrow speeds of all markets in its scope. 
2. If the market has not been added, then the speed is initialized to 500 (0x2386F26FC10<PASSWORD>0).
This means the contract can control the initial borrowing speed of any market that is added to it.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was five. Also, can you write it in a way that I can understand it? Please use simple language and make it easy to understand. Thank you!
