Reason: The variable `_token` in the function `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance` is an input parameter that represents the address of a token for which the user's compounded liquidity balance is being calculated. It is used to access the corresponding `Pool` from the `pools` mapping and to interact with the `alToken` to get the user's liquidity shares.

On the other hand, the variable `tokenPricePerUnit` in the function `calculateCollateralAmount` is a local variable that is assigned the price of the `_token` as returned by the `priceOracle`. The `tokenPricePerUnit` is used to calculate the collateral amount in the context of a liquidation process.

There is no direct data dependency between `_token` in `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance` and `tokenPricePerUnit` in `calculateCollateralAmount` because they are used in separate functions for different purposes and their values are not derived from each other. The `_token` in `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance` is used to identify a pool and get user shares, while `tokenPricePerUnit` in `calculateCollateralAmount` is used to calculate a value based on the price of the token. The two variables are related to the same token entity conceptually, but there is no data flow or computational dependency between them in the context of the provided code.
