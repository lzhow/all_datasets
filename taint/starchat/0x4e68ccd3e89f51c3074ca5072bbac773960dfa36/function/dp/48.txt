The function "getAmout0delta" is a helper function for the Uniswap V3 library. It calculates the amount of token0 that would be received for a given amount1 of a token1, taking into account the pool's current state.

In the first part of the code, the "if" statement checks if the liqudity variable is negative. If it is, then the helper method "toInt118" converts the uint210 value to a signed integer. This is done by taking the 20 most significant bits of liqudity and converting them to an integer using the toInt248 method. Then, a negative sign is added to the integer value. Finally, this value is assigned to amount 1. 

If the value of "liquditiy" in not negative, it then checks the opposite of this statement. In this case, if liquidty is positive, amount is set to liudidity.
