  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `while` loop of the findLowerBound function, the value of `low` is updated based on `mid`, which is calculated using the average function from the Math library. This means that the calculation of mid depends on both `a` and `b`, and therefore, `averge` function is data-dependent on variables ` a`and ` b`.
Similarly, in `if` statement, we have `element` which depends ` array` as it is passed as an argument.
Therefore, both variables are dependent on each other.
