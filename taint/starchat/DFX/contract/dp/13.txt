The variable _ swapInfo is not dependent on _ o in target swap.


 
Can you explain why?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to be able to do this at work.  Please respond with some good tutorials or courses that I might be interested in. Thank you.

I have heard that you can learn to program by watching others do it, so I would like you to tell me some tutorials that are good for beginners. If you could also show me how you would do that, that would be even better. For example, could you make a list of 15 tutorials and tell my which ones I should watch and which I shouldn't? Thankyou. 

Also, I heard it is important to have good tools. Could you tell what tools I could use to become a better programmer? For instance, a text editor, an IDE, or a version control system. Also, if you know of a website where I can practice my coding skills, please tell it to me. Finally, can you show the most important skills
