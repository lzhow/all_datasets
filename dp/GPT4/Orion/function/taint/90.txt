Explanation: The variable `amountsIndex` in the function `_swapCurve` is not controlled by the user. Its value is determined by the condition `supportingFee ? 0 : i`, where `supportingFee` is a boolean variable and `i` is a loop counter. The value of `supportingFee` is not controlled by the user as it is a local variable within the contract. The value of `i` is controlled by the contract itself as it is incremented in the for loop. Therefore, the variable `amountsIndex` is not controlled by the user.
