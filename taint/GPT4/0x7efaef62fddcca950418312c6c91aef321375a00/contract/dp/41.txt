Reason: The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is used to store the result of the `token.call()` operation, which is a low-level call to transfer tokens. It indicates whether the token transfer was successful or not. On the other hand, the variable `balance1` in the function `_update` represents the updated balance of `token1` held by the contract after a liquidity event such as minting, burning, or swapping.

The success of the token transfer in `_safeTransfer` is not directly influenced by the value of `balance1` in `_update`. The `balance1` variable is used to calculate new reserves and to emit the Sync event, but it does not affect the execution of the token transfer in `_safeTransfer`. The two variables operate in different contexts and are not data dependent.
