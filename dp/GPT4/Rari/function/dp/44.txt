Explanation: The variable `b` in the function `add` is data dependent on the variable `b` in the function `sub`. This is because the value of `b` is used in both functions to perform arithmetic operations (`a + b` in `add` and `a - b` in `sub`). Any changes to the value of `b` in one function will affect the result of the operation in the other function.
