  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_sellingNFTFfeEht` variable is calculated based on `_ price` and `USDPrice_sELL`. The `_p`variable is also calculated using `_Price`and `UsdPrice_Sell`. Therefore, `_ Price` is data-dependent on `Price`.
Similarly, in function  `UpdateFeess`, the `buynftfeeEHT`is calculated by dividing `1*1E19` by `_P`, which is based `_PRice` divided by `usdPriceBUy`. So, `BuyNTFFeeETH` depends on`_Price`, and therefore, it is a dependent variable.
Therefore, both `_SellingNTFeFfEHt`in function`UpdateFess` are dependent on variable`Price.`
