Reason: The contract state `_partitionsOf` is a mapping that keeps track of the partitions associated with a particular address. It is used to manage the different partitions of tokens that an address might have. On the other hand, the variable `_subtractedValue` in the function `decreaseAllowance` is used to decrease the allowance of a spender for a particular partition of tokens. The `_subtractedValue` variable is used to modify the `_allowedByPartition` mapping, which tracks the allowances for each partition by owner and spender.

The function `decreaseAllowance` modifies the allowance for a spender by subtracting the `_subtractedValue` from the current allowance in `_allowedByPartition`. This operation does not interact with or affect the `_partitionsOf` state. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_partitionsOf` and `_subtractedValue` as they are related to different aspects of the contract's state and functionality.
