  
No, the `_ name` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is passed as an argument to `ERc2O` contract.

The `name()` function returns the name of the token and it can be changed by calling the `rename()` method. However, in this case, since the constructor function does not have any parameters, there is nothing that the end-user can do to change the value of `_NAME`.
