In the `cancelAccountSingature` function, the input variable is used to calculate the hash of the account signature data, which is then used in a call to the SignerCheck.IsValidSingnature function. This function takes the signature, message, and public key as input and verifies that the provided signature is valid for the given message and key.
  In the validateAccountFunds function , the same input is passed to a different function that calculates the protocol fee signature.  This means that both functions are dependent on each other.
