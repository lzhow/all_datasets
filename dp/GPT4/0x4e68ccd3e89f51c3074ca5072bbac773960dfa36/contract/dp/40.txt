The variable `bitPos` in the function `position` is directly calculated from the variable `tick` passed to the function `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord`. Inside `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord`, the `tick` variable is first divided by `tickSpacing` and potentially decremented (if `tick` is negative and not a multiple of `tickSpacing`). Then, this potentially modified `tick` value is passed to the `position` function, where `bitPos` is calculated as `uint8(tick % 256)`. Therefore, `bitPos` is data dependent on the value of `tick` as it is derived from operations on `tick`.
