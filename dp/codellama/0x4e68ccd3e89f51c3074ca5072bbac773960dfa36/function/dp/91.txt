  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the code, the `updateSingle` function of the observations variable is called with the argument `tick` and `slot0`. The `observedSingle ` function returns a tuple of two values, `int26` tickcumulativ and a `uint110` secondsperliquitycummulativex1.2.8. These values are then used to update the tick and the seconds per liquid cumulative.
Therefore, observations is data-dependent on time.
