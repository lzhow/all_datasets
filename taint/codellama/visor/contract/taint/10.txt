  
No, the `_totalBalances ` variable in this function is NOT controlled  by a user because it's a private variable that is only accessible within the contract. It is used to store the total balance of the token.

The variable is declared as private, which means that it can only be accessed within this contract and not by any external users. Additionally, since it does not have any public getter function, users cannot access its value directly. Therefore, this variable cannot be controlled directly by users and is considered to be under the control of smart contract developers.
