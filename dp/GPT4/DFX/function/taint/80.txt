Explanation: The variable `_omega` in the function `enforceSwapInvariant` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the values of `_oGLiq` and `_omega`, which are parameters passed to the function. The calculation of `_omega` does not involve any user input or external factors that could be controlled by the user. Therefore, the variable `_omega` is not controlled by the user.
