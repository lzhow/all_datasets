Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `merkleProof` in the function `depositWithWhitelist` is not directly used or referenced in the function `allowance`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between these two variables. However, without further information about the implementation of the functions or any potential indirect dependencies, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship between `merkleProof` and `_spender` with certainty. Hence, the label is unknown.
