Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `depositEth` is an input parameter that represents the amount of Ether to be deposited to the WETH contract. It is used solely within the `depositEth` function to specify the value sent with the `deposit` function call to the WETH contract.

On the other hand, the variable `reserveIn` in the function `getReserves` is a local variable that is assigned a value based on the reserves of a Uniswap pair contract. The value of `reserveIn` is determined by the `getReserves` function of the Uniswap pair contract and the `direction` boolean parameter.

Since `amount` is not used to calculate `reserveIn`, nor is `reserveIn` used to determine the value of `amount`, there is no data dependency between these two variables. They operate independently within their respective functions and do not influence each other's values.
