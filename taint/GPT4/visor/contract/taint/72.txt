Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `errorMessage` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is a parameter that could potentially be supplied by the user of the contract if the function is exposed to external calls or if it is called by another function within the contract that receives input from the user. However, without additional context on how the `functionCallWithValue` function is used within the contract or by other contracts, it is not possible to definitively determine whether `errorMessage` is user-controlled. If the function is only used internally and the `errorMessage` is always set by the contract's code, then it would not be user-controlled. If the function or the contract that includes it is designed to accept `errorMessage` from external calls, then it could be user-controlled. Since the provided code is a library and does not show how the functions are called, the control over `errorMessage` cannot be determined with the given information, hence the label is 'unknown'.
