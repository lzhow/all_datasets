No, the variable `nonceBefore` in the function `safePermit` is not data dependent on the variable `owner` in the function `safePermit`. 

The reason is that the value of `nonceBefore` is assigned the result of the function call `token.nonces(owner)` which retrieves the nonce value associated with the `owner` address. The value of `owner` is passed as an argument to the `safePermit` function, but it is not modified or used in any way to compute the value of `nonceBefore`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
