The variable `absoluteInputAmount` in the function `execute` is directly assigned the return value of the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount`, which calculates its return value based on the variable `amount` among other inputs. The relationship between `absoluteInputAmount` and `amount` is established through the call to `getAbsoluteInputAmount` and the use of `amount` within that function to determine the returned value. Therefore, `absoluteInputAmount` is data dependent on `amount`.
