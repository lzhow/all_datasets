  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_addliquidty` function, the `token A` and `Token B` are passed as arguments to the _`swapcurve`function.
`token a` is used to create a pair in `factory` using the`createpair` method.  The `pair address`is then passed to`_swap` as an argument.   The`curfactory address is also passed into` _ swap`as an arguement.   
Therefore, ` pool` depends on ` curfactory`.
