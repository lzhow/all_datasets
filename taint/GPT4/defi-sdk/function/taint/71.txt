  
The variable 'typeHash' in function 'hash' is a constant and is defined in line 10 of the code. It is used to define the type of data that is being hash. Therefore, the value of ' typeHash ' is determined by its definition and cannot be controlled or changed by a user, so the answer is 'No'.

In general, any variable that starts with a capital letter and has a value that does not change during the execution of a program is considered a 'constant' or 'immutable' variable. These variables are not intended to be changed or modified by users, and their values are determined at compile time or during initialization.
