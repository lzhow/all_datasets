Explanation: The variable `i` is used in the for loop `for(uint i; i < N_COINS; ++i)` to iterate over the elements of the `xp` array. The length of the `xp` array is determined by the variable `N_COINS`, which is calculated based on the length of the `xp` array in the same function. Therefore, the variable `i` is data dependent on the variable `N_COINS`, which in turn is data dependent on the variable `S`. Hence, the variable `i` is data dependent on the variable `S`.
