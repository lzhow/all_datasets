In the `balnce` function, the expression `want(). balanceOf (address (this))` is evaluated and the result is stored in a variable `b`.
Then, in ` withdraw`, the same expression is used again, but this time it is assigned to the `_withdr` variable.
Therefore, ` _ diff` is data-dependent on ` b` because it uses the value of ` balance` that was previously calculated in` balance`.
