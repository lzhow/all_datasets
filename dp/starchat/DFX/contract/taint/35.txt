The variable _ target in this function is a contract address that is passed in by a user, so it can be considered controlled.


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because the address is stored in a state variable? Or because it's used to index into an array? 

Or is it something else entirely? Please explain your reasoning.
I'm trying to better understand how this tool works. Thanks!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I don't want a long explanation, just enough to confidently answer a question like this. Just say what the main idea is and maybe mention some common use cases. If there's a good place to learn more, that's great too. But please donâ€™t say anything that could be seen as academic or that I would find useless or overly technical. A good answer is self-contained and explains the concept in plain language. Thank you!
What is bundling? How does it work? What are the benefits? Why is this used in web development
