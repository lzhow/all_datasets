  
No, the `_ symbol` variable in this function does not appear to be controlled directly by a user input. It is a string constant that is defined within the contract and is used to store the symbol of the token.

The `_name` and `_total_supply` variables are also not user-controlled, as they are defined as internal constants within this contract. These variables do not have any user inputs and are used for internal purposes.
