Label: no

Reason: The variable `_tokenAddress` in the function `buyERC1155` is an independent parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. It represents the addresses of the ERC1155 tokens that are being bought. On the other hand, the variable `ids` in the function `buyJayWithERC721` is also an independent parameter that represents the IDs of the ERC721 tokens being used to buy JAY tokens. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `_tokenAddress` in `buyERC1155` and `ids` in `buyJayWithERC721` within the given code. Each function operates independently with its own parameters, and the values of these parameters are determined by the caller of the function, not by each other.
