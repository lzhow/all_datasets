Label: yes

Reason: The variable `newOwner` in the function `transferTokenOwnership` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function can only be called by the current owner of the contract (as enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier), and the owner is initially set to the address that deployed the contract (`msg.sender` in the constructor), the `newOwner` variable is indeed controlled by the user. The user who has the ability to call this function can set `newOwner` to any address they choose when they invoke the function.
