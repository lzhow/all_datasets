Label: no

Reason: The variable `a` in the function `mul` and the variable `b` in the function `mod` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. In Solidity, function parameters are local to the function and do not have a data dependency relationship with parameters of other functions unless they are modified by reference, which is not the case here since Solidity does not support passing parameters by reference to internal functions. Each function call to `mul` or `mod` will have its own independent instances of `a` and `b`, and changes to one will not affect the other. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `a` in `mul` and `b` in `mod`.
