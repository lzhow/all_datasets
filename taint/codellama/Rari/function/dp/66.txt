In this example, the `rewardDistibutors` array is a contract variable, and the loop iterates over its elements. However, it does not access the elements of the array directly, but rather calls a function on each element. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the state of `RewardDistriubtorDelegate` is data-dependent on `src` or `cTokens`.
