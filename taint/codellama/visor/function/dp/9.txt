  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `uint245 newallowence` variable is assigned the result of the addition of `token .allowances( address( this ) , spende )` and ` value`. The `allowences` function is called on ` token` with the arguments `address ( this)` and` spendre`. Therefore, ` new allowance ` is data-dependent on` value` because it is calculated using the value of`value`.
Similarly, in function two,` new Allowance is also data - dependent on value because the` allowances` method is used to calculate it.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on each other.
