The variable target in function call is a user-controlled input, and as such, the input must be sanitized before being used in a function that interacts with external contracts. This is because the target variable can be used to specify the address of a contract that the caller wants to call, which could result in unintended interactions with contracts that are not authorized to interact with the calling contract.

In this case, since the goal of the program is to identify user input that could potentially be dangerous or harmful, any user inputs that can potentially cause harm or danger should be validated and sanitized to ensure that they conform to the expected format and type.


  Can you give me an example of how to do that? I'm not very good at coding. I just want to know how I can make my code more secure. Can I use libraries to make it easier? Can't I make the code shorter? How do I know if my sanitization is good enough? What are some things I should definitely not do? Please help me!
