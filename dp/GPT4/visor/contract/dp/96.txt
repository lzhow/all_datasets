Reason: The variable `amount` in the `sendValue` function is used to specify how much value (in wei) is to be sent to the `recipient`. It is checked against the contract's balance to ensure there are sufficient funds before making the call to send the value. On the other hand, the variable `success` in the `functionDelegateCall` function is a boolean that indicates the success or failure of the delegate call to the target contract. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the `amount` variable and the `success` variable in these two separate functions. The `amount` is used for a value transfer, while `success` is used to indicate the result of a delegate call operation. They operate independently within their respective functions and do not influence each other.
