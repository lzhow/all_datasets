Reason: The variable `pool` in the `borrow` function is a storage pointer to a specific pool in the `pools` mapping, indexed by the address of the `_token` parameter. It represents the state of the pool associated with the given token at the time of the borrow operation.

The variable `_user` in the `liquidateInternal` function is a parameter representing the address of the user whose position is being liquidated. It is used to index into the `userPoolData` mapping to access the user's specific data for the token and collateral pools.

The relationship between `pool` and `_user` is indirect. The `pool` variable's state is not directly influenced by the `_user` variable itself but by the actions performed on the pool that `_user` might be a part of. The state of `pool` could be affected by any user's actions, not just `_user`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the `pool` variable in the `borrow` function and the `_user` variable in the `liquidateInternal` function. They operate on different levels of the contract's state: one on the pool level and the other on the user level within a pool.
