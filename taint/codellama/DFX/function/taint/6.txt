  
The variable 'recipent' in function 'flash' is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user input.

In the flash function, the recipent variable is passed as an argument to another function called IFLashCallBack.flashCallbak. This function is called by msg sender. Therefore, if a malicious user can control the msg, they can also control what is sent to recipant.
