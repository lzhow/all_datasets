Explanation: The variable `returndata` is assigned the value of the function call `address(token).functionCall(data, "SafeERC20: low-level call failed")`. This function call depends on the variable `token` as it is used as an argument. Therefore, the variable `returndata` is data dependent on the variable `token`.
