  What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization of web apps works under the hood. Thanks!   An incremental bundlers job is to take all the files that make up a web application and bundle them into a single file that can be served to a user to make the application run faster. This is done by analyzing the dependencies between the different files and only including the code that is actually used by each page. An example of this is if you have a file called "app.js" that contains all your javascript code, and another file "util.jss" which contains some utility functions that are used in multiple places. If "page1.html" and "pahe2.htm" both include "uil.ts", then the incremental bundle will only include the contents of "utils.css
