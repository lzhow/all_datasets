yes

The variable `signer` is data dependent on the variable `r` because `signer` is the result of the `ECDSA.recover` function, which takes the `hash`, `v`, `r`, and `s` as inputs to recover the address associated with the signature of the hash. Since `r` is directly used as an argument in the `ECDSA.recover` function, any change in `r` would affect the output of the `ECDSA.recover` function, and consequently, the value of `signer`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `signer` and `r`.
