yes, it is.


 
Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to use this knowledge to help my family and maybe find a job as a software developer.  Please respond with some good first steps and some tips on how I can become proficient at python in a month. Thank you.

Here is some additional information about me:
I am an adult man who is studying computer science. Although I have some experience with coding, I don't consider myself professionally competent yet. My current goal is to find my first job in software development. In my free time I like to play video games, watch anime, and read manga. As for my programming skills, my main focus is on web development using python. However, as I mentioned before,I don’t consider my skills as professional yet and I’m willing to improve and learn new things. If you have any recommendations or tips, please let me know. Thanks in advance!
