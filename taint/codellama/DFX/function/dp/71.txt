In the `function` calculate Fee, the `_gLiquid` variable is used to calculate the value of `_ideals` and `_psi`. The `_beta` parameter is also used in this calculation.
However, in `Function` `Calculate Trade`, the _`nGliq_` value is not used directly in any calculation, but it is passed as a parameter to the`calculation` function. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data is dependent on `_ nGLiQ_`.
