   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn about the topic for a university assignment. Thank you!



  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This makes it easier for the browser to load the application and makes the initial load time faster.

Webpack is probably the most popular example of an incremental bundle tool. It takes in multiple files, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files and bundles them together into one or more output files. Then it can optimize and minify these files to make them smaller and faster to serve to users. Additionally, Webpack can also automatically update the bundle file when any of the input files change, which makes development easier.


Overall, an increment bundlers job is to take in all of your application's assets and create a package that is optimized for serving
