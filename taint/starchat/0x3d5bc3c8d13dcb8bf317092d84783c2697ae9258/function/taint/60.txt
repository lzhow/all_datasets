   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization process works in web development. Thanks!




An incremental bundlers job is to take all the files that make up your application and bundle them into a single file that can be served to the browser. This makes it easier for your browser to load the application since it only has to download a small amount of data instead of having to make multiple requests for each file.

When you make changes to your code, the incremental bundle will only include the changed files, which makes for a much faster development experience. Additionally, since the bundle is incremental, you can make more changes without having the build process rebundle the entire application.


Webpack is widely used as an incremental build tool in modern web
