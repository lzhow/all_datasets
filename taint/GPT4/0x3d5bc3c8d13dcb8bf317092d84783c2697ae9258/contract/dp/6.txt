Reason: The variable `redeemer` in the function `redeemAllowed` and the variable `cToken` in the function `borrowVerify` are function parameters that are independent of each other. Each function call operates with its own set of parameters, and there is no direct relationship or dependency between the parameters of these two separate functions as shown in the provided code. The `redeemAllowed` function is concerned with the redemption process, while the `borrowVerify` function is related to the verification of a borrowing action. There is no code in the provided snippet that indicates any shared state or interaction between these two variables that would establish a data dependency relationship.
