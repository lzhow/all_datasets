The variable `token` in the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount` is directly assigned a value from the `tokenAmount` parameter, which is of a struct type that includes a field named `token`. The line `address token = tokenAmount.token;` establishes a data dependency relationship between `token` and `tokenAmount`, as the value of `token` is derived from the `token` field of the `tokenAmount` struct. Therefore, any changes to the `token` field within the `tokenAmount` argument passed to the function will affect the value of the `token` variable within the function.
