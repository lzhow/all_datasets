Reason: The contract state `_totalSupply` is a variable that represents the total number of tokens in supply for the contract. It is modified in functions that mint or burn tokens, and it is returned by the `totalSupply()` function. On the other hand, the variable `_tokenHolder` in the function `_isOperator` is a parameter that represents the address of a token holder whose operator status is being checked. The function `_isOperator` checks whether a given address `_operator` is an authorized operator for the `_tokenHolder`. There is no direct modification or dependency between `_totalSupply` and `_tokenHolder` within the `_isOperator` function or elsewhere in the contract that would indicate a data dependency relationship. The `_totalSupply` is not used or modified in the `_isOperator` function, nor does the `_tokenHolder` have any influence on the value of `_totalSupply`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
