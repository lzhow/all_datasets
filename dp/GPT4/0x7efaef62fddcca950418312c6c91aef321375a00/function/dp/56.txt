Label: no

Reason: The variable `_blockTimestampLast` in the function `getReserves` is assigned the value of the state variable `blockTimestampLast` and is not modified within the function. It is simply returned as part of the function's output. On the other hand, the variable `_token1` in the function `burn` is assigned the value of the state variable `token1` and is used to interact with the corresponding ERC20 token contract. There is no interaction or shared state between `_blockTimestampLast` and `_token1` within the given code snippet. Therefore, `_blockTimestampLast` does not have a data dependency on `_token1`.
