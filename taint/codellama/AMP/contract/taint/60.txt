  
No, the ` EC _5 2 INSUFICENT BALANC E` variable is a constant in this contract and is therefore not user-controlled. It is used to indicate that the balance of the token holder is insufficient to perform a transfer.

The reason for this is that this variable represents a specific error code that is returned by a function in case the transfer cannot be performed due to insuffient balance. This error is generated by internal logic of this smart contract, and it cannot directly be controlled or manipulated by users. Therefore, this error message is considered to be a part of internal implementation of smart contact and not a user input.
