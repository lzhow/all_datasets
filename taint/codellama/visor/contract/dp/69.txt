  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `SaferMath` library, the functions `tryAdd`, `add`, and `sub` are defined. These functions take two arguments, `uint a` and` uint b`, which are the two operands of the arithmetic operation.
For example, in `function tryadd( uint a , uintb)internal purereturns(bool ,uint 2 5 6 )`, the variables ` a ` and  ` b ` are used as operand.  The function returns a tuple of two values: a boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded, and the result of  the addition operation if it succeeded. If the sum is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by the type, it returns false and zero. In the case of ` functionadd ( uinta , uin b ) internalpurereturns(uin t  ) `, if the value of a is zero, then the return value is also zero; otherwise, return the product of` a  and b`.
Similarly, for the modulus operation, we have ` mod (u in t a )` function. This function takes two parameters,` u in  t b`and`u int a`. The return type is`uint`. This operation returns the remainder of dividing`a `by` b `.
Therefore, In `uint a`,`mod` is data-dependent on ` uint  b  `.
