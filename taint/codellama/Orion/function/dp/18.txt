The variable x in getAmoutInCuve is not dependent on factory in function  get Amounts In. This is because the x variable is calculated using the getY function, which takes in parameters such as j and i. These parameters are calculated within the scope of the for loop in  the  function. Therefore, the value of x is only dependent  on  j  and  i  which are local variables within  that scope.
