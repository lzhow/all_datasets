The variable _ogliq is a temporary variable used to calculate the gros liquidity of the curve and is used in subsequent calculations. It is therefore not directly controlled or influenced by user input.


  What is an example of a contract that uses this library?  What are some examples of contracts that are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks if this variable is exposed?

I'm trying to understand how to prevent re-entracy attacks in my smart contract.  I've read about the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern, but I'm not sure if it applies in this case.
Can you explain how the checks-effects-interactions pattern can be used here to mitigate reentrant attacks? Or is there another approach I should be using? 

Thanks!





   How do I make a table in MathJax? I want to put the headings A, B, C in a row at the top, and the numbers 1, 2,3 in another row below that. I also want them to be centered. Can you show me how? Thanks!  $ \begin{array}{c|c} A & B \\ \hline C & 3 \
