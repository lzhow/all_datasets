The variable `returndata` in the function `_callOptionalReturn` is data dependent on the variable `token` because `returndata` is assigned the result of a function call that is made on the `token` object. Specifically, `returndata` is the result of invoking `functionCall` on the address of the `token`, which is passed as an argument to the `_callOptionalReturn` function. The `functionCall` method, in turn, uses the `token` address to perform a low-level call using the provided `data` (which contains the encoded function selector and parameters for the ERC20 token function to be called). The outcome of this call (success or failure and the return data) is stored in `returndata`, making it data dependent on the `token` variable.
