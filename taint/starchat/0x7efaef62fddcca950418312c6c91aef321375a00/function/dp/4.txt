Explanation:
In the `_burn` method, the liqudity is burned and the amount of token 1 and token2 is calculated based on this liqulity and total supply. Then the token is transfered to the recipient. In the `safe_transfer` the value is sent to recipient and also a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer is returned. This boolean is used to check if the transaction was successful or not. If the boolean returned is `False` then the program will throw an error.
