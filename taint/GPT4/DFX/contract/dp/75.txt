Reason: The variable `amt_` in the function `getTargetSwapData` is data dependent on the variable `_outputIx` in the function `viewTargetSwapData`. This is because `amt_` represents the amount that is being swapped and is used to calculate the new balances (`nBals_`) in the liquidity pool. The index `_outputIx` is used to identify the specific asset in the pool for which the new balance is being calculated after the swap. The line `nBals_[_outputIx] = ABDKMath64x64.sub(nBals_[_outputIx], amt_);` directly modifies the balance of the asset at the index `_outputIx` by subtracting the amount `amt_`. This shows a direct data dependency as the value of `amt_` affects the resulting balance of the asset at `_outputIx`, and the same logic applies in both `getTargetSwapData` and `viewTargetSwapData` functions.
