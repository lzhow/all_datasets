In the provided Solidity function `findUpperBound`, the variable `low` is data dependent on the variable `high`. This is because the value of `low` is determined in part by the value of `high` within the `while` loop. Specifically, the line `uint256 mid = Math.average(low, high);` calculates the average of `low` and `high`, and the result is assigned to `mid`. Then, depending on the comparison `if (array[mid] > element)`, the value of `high` can be updated to `mid`. Since the value of `low` is subsequently updated based on the new value of `high` (`low = mid + 1;`), there is a clear data dependency between `low` and `high`. The value of `low` in each iteration of the loop is influenced by the potential changes to `high` in the previous iteration.
