  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `safeTranserFrom` function, the first argument is `IErc22 token`. The `transer` method is called on this token with the arguments `from`, `to`, and `value`.
On the other hand, in `_calloptionalReturn` the argument `address` is passed to the method `functioncall` which is a method of the contract `Address`. This method takes two arguments, `bytes memory` and a string.
Therefore, it is clear that the data in `tokent` depends on `datat` because the address of `Token` contract is used in a call to `FunctionCall` of another contract.
