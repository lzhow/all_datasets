In the given code, the `blockTimestamp` variable is calculated using the current block timestamp, which is a contract variable.
`block` is also a variable in Solidiy, and it contains information about the block, including the timestamp.  The `timestamp` property of the` block` object is used to calculate the time elapsed between the last update and the previous block. This time is then used in calculations to update the price cumulative variables. Therefore, `time elapse` depends on ` blocktimestamp`.
Since ` timeelapese`is calculated based on` timestamp`, it is data-dependent on it.
