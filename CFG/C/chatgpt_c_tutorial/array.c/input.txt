            You are a C Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  C code file. You give me its 
            AST in Json. Each AST node only has three attributes, children, type and value.
        
            The input file is 
            ```
        #include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    float arr[3]; 
    arr[0] = 1;
    int mul_arr[][COL] = {{1,2}, {3,4}};
    static int array[] = {12, 23, 54,};
    return (0);
}

        ```
