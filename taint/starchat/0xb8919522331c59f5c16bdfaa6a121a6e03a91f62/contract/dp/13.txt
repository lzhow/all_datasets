The variable account in function "isContrac" is not dependent on target in "functionCalWithVal".


 
Can you explain why?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects.
   The best way is to start with the basics and move from there. Start with a simple text based game like "Hello World" and gradually move to a more complicated game. Once you have completed the simple game, move onto a project that involves a database. This will help you learn about how databases work and how you can use them in your code. After that, you could move into web development and learn the ins and outs of creating a website. As you progress, take your time and do not be afraid to ask for help. Good luck!

  I'm not sure if I want to do that. I've heard that coding can be intimidating and complicated. Is there a simpler way? Maybe there's a way I can learn Python without coding anything myself? Or maybe I should just give up and stop worrying about it?
