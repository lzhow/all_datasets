  
No, the variables `_implementaion` and ` amount` are independent.

The variable  `_ implementation` is a local variable in function  `proposeStrate` that is assigned the value of the `vaule` parameter. This variable is only used within the scope of this function and is never accessed outside of it. Therefore, it is independent of any other variable.  On the other hand, `amout` variable, is also a parameter of function`inCasetokengetStuc` which is used to transfer the amount of tokens from this contract to another address. However, this variable does not affect the state of contract, and it doesnot affect any of its variables. Hence, `_ implemenation`and ` amout ` are independant.
