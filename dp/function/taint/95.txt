  
No, the `` variable in add function of the contract is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be modified by any external user or function.

The variable is created inside the add() function and is only accessible within that function, so it cannot be accessed or modified from outside the scope of that variable. Therefore, this variable cannot have any user-controlled input.
