Label: no

Reason: In the provided Solidity code, the variable `target` and the variable `errorMessage` are both parameters of the function `functionCall`. There is no operation within the function that assigns a value from `errorMessage` to `target` or vice versa. The function simply passes these parameters along to another function `functionCallWithValue` without modifying them or establishing any kind of computational relationship between the two. Therefore, `target` is not data dependent on `errorMessage` within the context of this function.
