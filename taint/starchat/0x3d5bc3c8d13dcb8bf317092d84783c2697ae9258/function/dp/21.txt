   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how. I have heard that python is easy, but I don't know where to start. What should I do? I've heard people talk about using repl.it, codecademy, and visual studio code. Which of these are the best? And what should be my first steps? Please help me. Thank you.

I am a high school student who is interested in computer science. My age is 13.  I was born in Germany. In my free time I like to play video games, read mangas, draw and paint. As a kid I always dreamed of becoming a professional gamer and artist. However, due to my lack of knowledge in this field I decided to study computer graphics and game development at the university. After completing my bachelor's degree I worked as a game developer for two years. During this time, I learned a lot about programming and how games are created.
