No, the variable `factory` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The `factory` variable is declared as `address public immutable` and is assigned a value in the constructor of the contract. Once assigned, the value of `factory` cannot be changed. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
