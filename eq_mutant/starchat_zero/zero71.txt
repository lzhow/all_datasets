Yes. Semantically equivalent code is code that produces the exact same results given a particular input, regardless of any changes or refinements made later. In this case, both codes calculate the square root of a number using Newton's method, but the second code makes a small modification that increases the accuracy of the result. So both are equivalent, in the mathematical sense, despite the small difference in behavior.
