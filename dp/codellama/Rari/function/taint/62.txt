  
The variable 'scaler' in function 'divScaler is a user-controlled variable.

This is because the 'mulScalr' function is called in ' divscalr', which takes a 'Exp' object as an argument. This means that the value of the scalar variable is determined by a previous function call, which is ' mulscal', and is therefore user controlled.
