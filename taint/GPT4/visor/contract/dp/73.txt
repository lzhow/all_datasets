Label: yes

Reason: In the Solidity contract code provided, the variable `data` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is indeed data dependent on the variable `value` in the same function. This is because the `data` variable is used as an argument in the `target.call{ value: value }(data)` expression. The `value` variable specifies the amount of wei to send with the call, and it is directly used in the call to the external contract. The `data` variable represents the calldata, or the function selector and arguments, that is sent along with the call. The success of the call and the return data (`returndata`) are dependent on both the `value` and the `data` being passed to the `call` function. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `data` and `value` within the `functionCallWithValue` function.
