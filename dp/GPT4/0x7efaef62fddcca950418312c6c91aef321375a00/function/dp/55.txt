Reason: The contract state `token1` is likely a state variable representing an address of a token used within the contract. The variable `feeOn` is a boolean that is set based on the result of the `_mintFee` function, which takes `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` as arguments. There is no direct assignment or computation in the provided code snippet that indicates `token1`'s value would be affected by the value of `feeOn`. The `feeOn` variable is used to determine whether to update the `kLast` state, but it does not interact with `token1`. Therefore, `token1` and `feeOn` do not have a data dependency relationship in the context of the `mint` function as shown.
