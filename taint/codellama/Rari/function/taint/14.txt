  
The variable implementation is labeled as 'Unknown'. The reason is that the implementation variable is set in multiple places in this contract, and it's not clear which one is being used in each case.

In the constructor, the `constructor()` function sets the initial value of `implemenation` to `address (0)`.
However, in `_becomImplemntation()`, the value is overwritten with `msg .sender` if `false` is true. This means that if a user calls this function, they can set the new value for ` implementation`.
Additionally, `_setImplentationInternal()` and `_prepare()` functions also set new values for the` implementation` variable, but itâ€™s unclear whether they are called by users or not.
