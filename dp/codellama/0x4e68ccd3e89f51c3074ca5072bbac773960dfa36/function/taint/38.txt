  
No, the ` amount  ` variable in `get Amount0 Delta` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` get Amout0 delta` function takes in three parameters: `sqrt Ration AX 9 6`, ` sq rt Rati0 BX  9  6 `, and `liqudity`. The ` liquidty` parameter is a user-controlled variable, but the other two parameters are not. Therefore, `Amount 1` cannot be controlled directly by a malicious user, as it depends on the values of the two other parameters.
