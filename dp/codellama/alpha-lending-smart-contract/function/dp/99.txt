In the `calculateRoudDownborRowSharAmount()` function, the `_amount` parameter is used to calculate the value of `pool` and `totalborrows`. The `Pool` storage variable is also used in this function.
On the other hand, in ` repaYInternal()` the`_share` variable and the  `userData` are used.  The`payBackShars` is calculated using the same `_share`.
Therefore, `_ token` depends on ` payBackAmount`.
