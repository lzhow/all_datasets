The variable 'pais' is an array of addresses that are passed as an argument to the 'callBytes' function. It is initialized in line 22 of the code, where it takes the value of an external function called 'getPais'. The ' getPai's function is defined in another contract, and it returns an address array. Therefore, the content of 'pair' variable is determined by an outside source, not by a user input.
