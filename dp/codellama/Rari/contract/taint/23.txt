  
The variable 'reserverFacorMantiissa' is a parameter in a constructor function. It is passed as an argument to the constructor and is therefore controlled  by a user of the contract.

In the code, the `constructor` function is defined as follows:
`constructor(comptrollor, interestrateModel, string name, symbol, implementation, byte memory, reservefactorMantinissa _, uint adminfeeMantineissa _) public`
This function takes 9 parameters, including `comprtroller`, `interestrate Model`, and `implementation`. The `adminfeemantissaa` and `_reservFectorManticissa` are also passed to this function as parameters. These parameters are used to initialize the state of a contract and are therefore under the control of users.
