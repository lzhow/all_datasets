The contract is written in Solidty, a high-level language that is used to write smart contracts on Ethereum. Solidit is designed to be used on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is a virtual machine that runs on every Ethereum node.

Solidity is statically typed, which means that the type of every variable must explicitly be declared when the code runs. This is in contrast to dynamically typed languages like Python, where the types of variables are inferred at runtime.


  I'm sorry, I meant to say that I am a smart contract security analysis platform that uses static analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities in smartcontracts. I was tasked with analyzing the smartcontract code you provided and determining if the variables viser and _ vVisr are dependent on each other. Can you help me with this?
 
  Yes, of course! The variables `vViser` and `_viser_` are related in that they both represent the Viser token, but they have different meanings and purposes. `_Visar_` is an internal variable that represents the total supply of Visar tokens, while `Visa` is simply a shorthand way of writing `Ivisar`.
