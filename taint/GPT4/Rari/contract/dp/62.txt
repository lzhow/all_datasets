Label: no

Reason: The variable `currentCompSpeed` in the function `setCompSupplySpeedInternal` is not data dependent on the variable `cTokens` in the function `claimRewards`. The variable `currentCompSpeed` is assigned a value based on the `compSupplySpeeds` mapping and the address of the `CToken` passed to `setCompSupplySpeedInternal`. It is used to determine the current supply speed of a specific `CToken` and is independent of the `cTokens` array in `claimRewards`.

The `cTokens` array in `claimRewards` is used to iterate over a list of `CToken` contracts for which rewards are being claimed. Each `CToken` in this array is used to call `updateCompSupplyIndex` and `distributeSupplierComp` or `updateCompBorrowIndex` and `distributeBorrowerComp` depending on whether the `borrowers` or `suppliers` flag is true.

The two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes within the contract, and there is no direct data flow or dependency from `cTokens` to `currentCompSpeed`.
