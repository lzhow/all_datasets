  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `Curves` contract, the `_assets` array is created with a length of 11, and the first 5 elements are assigned to the values of `_asset[i]` and `_weight[j]`. The `_assimilation` variables are also assigned values in this function.
Since the variables `_quotesAssilimator`, `_basesAssiliator,` and`_quoteWeigth` are all used to create the` _assililation `array, which is then used in` new curve`, it is likely that they have data dependencies.
