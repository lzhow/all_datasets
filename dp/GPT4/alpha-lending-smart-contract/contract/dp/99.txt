Label: no

Reason: The variable `_amount` in the function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityShareAmountExternal` and the variable `_rate` in the function `calculateLinearInterestExternal` are function parameters that are local to their respective functions. There is no direct relationship or data flow between these two variables within the given code snippet. Each function operates independently, and the parameters are passed in by the caller of the function. There is no code in the provided snippet that indicates any dependency or interaction between `_amount` and `_rate`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
