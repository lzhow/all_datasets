  
The variable error message in function callWithvalue is a string literal. It is hardcoded in solidty code. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In solidy, a variable is considered controlled if it can be changed by a user or an external agent. In this case, since the errormessage is defined as a hard-coded string, and it cannot be modified by any user, we can conclude that it's not user-controlled.
