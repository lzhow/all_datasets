The variable _ from is a user-controlled variable in this function. It is used to retrieve the sender of the transfer.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? I've heard that it's a good idea to check for user control in a contract before making any changes to it. How can I do that? Can you give me some tips?

I'm writing a smart contract that allows users to buy and sell NFTs. I want to make sure that the NTFs are transferred safely and that users can't buy or sell them if they don't have the right permissions. Can I use a tool like Slither to automatically check if my contract has any user controls? How would I go about doing that if I can use Slinter? Is there anything else I should be aware of when writing my smart contracts? Please help me understand how to write secure smartcontracts.
Can you explain how Slitherr works? What does it do? And how can it be used in my case? If it can, how do i install it?  Please explain it in simple terms for a complete beginner
