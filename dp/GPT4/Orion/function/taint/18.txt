Explanation: The variable `reserveB` in the function `_addLiquidity` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value returned by the `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.getReserves` function, which retrieves the reserves of the specified tokens from the factory contract. The user does not have control over the values of the reserves.
