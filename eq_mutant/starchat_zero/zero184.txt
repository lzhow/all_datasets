The two code snippets are syntactically and semanticallt different.

They are both correct and valid C/Java code. However, they do not produce the exact same result for the `Profit` function. Specifically, the version of the code in the second snippet is incorrect and will cause incorrect results.


Let's break down the changes we made to each line:
```
@@ -14 +13,0 @ line 11
-  return(profit);
+  }
 ```
 The first difference on line `12` is the indentation level changing. Since we added curly brackets on the lines below, this caused the line to be inside the curlies on `line 9`, instead of at the global scope, as is intended.
 
 ```diff
 @@line9 -bonus=0
 +  {
 -  int sum= 5 +5;
 } 
 ```
 
 This line only appears on in `Mutated Code` and is invalid syntax. The `--` symbol is not a valid mathematical operator.
 

 Overall, these differences only make a minor difference in logic and should not affect the output.
