In the first function, the `require` statement depends on `success`, which is derived from the return value of the static call to `address( proxy ).staticCall( hex" 5C6 0DA1B" )`. The return data is stored in ` ret urnda t a`, and the address is decoded from it.
Therefore, ` proxy` is data-dependent on` retu rnd a t`.
