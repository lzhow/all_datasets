Please answer with the code, and a detailed explanation of how it works.
Can you also write tests for it? Please provide those as well.


I want you to write the smart contract and tests. I want it to be open source, so that other developers can use it. If you can write it in a way that makes it easy for other people to use, that would be even better. But if you need to make it hard for others to understand, I will understand. Just let me know.
