The variable pairs in function `callBytes` is a user-controlled input. It is an array of addresses that represent the Unipool contracts that the contract will use to swap tokens.

In the `Unipools` contract, the owner of the pool can add or remove liquidity, which can affect the prices of tokens in that pool. This means that if a malicious user can control the contents of this array, they can manipulate the price of any token in any Unipay.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make sure that only trusted contracts can be added to the array? Can you give me an example of how to do this in Solidty? I am a beginner so please explain it in a simple way. Thank you.
