Label: no

Reason: The variable `_tokenHolder` in the function `isOperator` is used to check if a given address `_operator` is an authorized operator for the token holder `_tokenHolder`. This variable is independent of the `_value` variable in the function `_removeTokenFromPartition`, which is used to adjust the balance of tokens from a specific partition for a given address `_from`. The `_value` variable represents the amount of tokens to be subtracted from the balance, and it does not influence the authorization check performed in `isOperator`. The two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes, with no direct data flow or dependency between them.
