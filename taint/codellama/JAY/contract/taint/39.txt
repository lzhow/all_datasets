  
No, the ` id` variable in `buJyWithErc 7  ` is NOT controlled  by  the  user .

The ` buy J yWith ER C 8 5 6 9 4 3  _  tokenAddress` function is called by ` bu yJ ay` and ` _ token Address` is passed as an argument.
  The ` ids` array is created in this function and is used to store the IDs of the NFT tokens that are being bought.  This array  is populated by calling the` I ER  C  7  2  1 . safeTransf erFrom` method on each token contract. This method is a part of  ER773 standard and allows the contract to transfer ownership of an NTF token from one address to another. In this case, `address (this)` is being passed to the method as the recipient address. Therefore, this variable is under the control of this contract and not the end user, and the answer is 'No'.
