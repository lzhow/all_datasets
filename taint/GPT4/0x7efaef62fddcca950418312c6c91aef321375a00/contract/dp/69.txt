The variable `balance0` in the function `_update` is not data dependent on the variable `timeElapsed` in the same function. `balance0` is assigned the value of the balance of `token0` for the contract's address, which is independent of the `timeElapsed` variable. The `timeElapsed` variable is used to calculate the time difference between the last update and the current block timestamp, which is then used to update `price0CumulativeLast` and `price1CumulativeLast` if certain conditions are met. However, this calculation and the `timeElapsed` variable do not influence the value of `balance0`.
