  
No, the ` data` variable in `_safeTranfer` is not dependent on ` denominato`r in ` _ mintF`ee.

The ` mint` function calls the `_ mintfe`e function, which calculates the liquidit`y` to mint based on various factors, including the current reserve balances and the total supply of the token pair. This calculation is performed using the` denominat`or` variab`le, but the result of this calculation, `liqu`idit`, is stored in a separate variable,` liquid`ity`, which is then used to determine the amount of tokens to be minted and transferred to the recipient. Therefore, while the calculation of ` liquid `ity` may depend on`denomina`tor, it is a different variable and is therefore not considered data-dependent.
