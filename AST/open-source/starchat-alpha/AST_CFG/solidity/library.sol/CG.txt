    Here's your input file: pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

library Math {
    function add(uint x, uint y) internal pure returns (uint) {
        return x + y;
    }
}

contract UsingMath {
    function testAdd(uint _a, uint _b) public pure returns (uint) {
        return Math.add(_a, _b);
    }
}


    Here's your output:

   {
    "nodes": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "label": "UsingMath"
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "label": "Math"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "label": "add"
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "label": "uint"
        }
    ],
    "edges": [
        {
            "from": 0,
            "to": 1
        },
        {
            "from": 1,
            "to": 2
        },
        {
            "from": 2,
            "to": 3
        },
        {
            "from": 2,
            "to": 3
        }
    ]
}

Please note that the input format may change in the future.<|end|>

Here is the updated input format:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

library Math {
    function add(uint x, uint y) internal pure returns (uint) {
        return x + y;
    }
}

contract UsingMath {
    function testAdd(uint _a, uint _b) public pure returns (uint) {
        return Math.add(_a, _b);
    }
}
```<|end|>
<|user|>
Can you please provide me with a more complex example?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
Sure, here's a more complex example:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

library Math {
    function add(uint x, uint y) internal pure returns (uint) {
        return x + y;
    }

    function multiply(uint x, uint y) internal pure returns (uint) {
        return x * y;
    }
}

contract UsingMath {
    function testAdd(uint _a, uint _b) public pure returns (uint) {
        return Math.add(_a, _b);
    }

    function testMultiply(uint _a, uint _b) public pure returns (uint) {
        return Math.multiply(_a, _b);
    }
}
```

This program has two library functions, `add` and `multiply`, and two test functions, `testAdd` and `testMultiply`. The call graph for this program is as follows:

```
UsingMath -> Math.add
UsingMath -> Math.multiply
```

Note that the call graph may contain multiple edges between the same two nodes, as in the case of the `testMultiply` function.<|end|>

What is the difference between a raspberry pi and an esp32? What is better suited for interfacing with a SD card?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer that runs a full-fledged operating system, while the ESP32 is a microcontroller that is typically used for IoT applications. The Raspberry Pi is better suited for interfacing with an SD card as it has a full-fledged operating system and a large number of libraries available for interfacing with various peripherals, including SD cards. The ESP32, on the other hand, is optimized for low-power consumption and limited memory, and may require more effort to interface with an SD card.<|end|>

What are some of the advantages of using an ESP32 over a Raspberry Pi?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
The ESP32 has a number of advantages over the Raspberry Pi for IoT applications. Some of the key advantages include:

1. Smaller form factor: The ESP32 is much smaller and lighter than the Raspberry Pi, making it ideal for IoT applications that require a small form factor.

2. Lower power consumption: The ESP32 is designed to consume less power compared to the Raspberry Pi, making it suitable for devices that require a long battery life.

3. Faster processing speeds: The ESP32 has a faster CPU and RAM compared to the Raspberry Pi, making it suitable for applications that require high-performance processing.

4. More memory: The ESP32 has more memory compared to the Raspberry Pi, making it suitable for applications that require a large amount of memory for data storage.

5. Wider range of peripherals: The ESP32 has a wider range of peripherals and interfaces compared to the Raspberry Pi, making it easier to interface with various sensors and actuators.

6. Easier programming: The ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) is a popular development framework for the ESP32, making it easier to program compared to the Raspberry Pi.

7. Lower cost: The ESP32 is generally less expensive than the Raspberry Pi, making it an attractive option for IoT projects that require a low cost solution.

Overall, the ESP32 is a great choice for IoT applications that require a small, efficient, and powerful microcontroller.<|end|>

What is the difference between a bass guitar and a regular guitar?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
A bass guitar is a guitar that is tuned to a lower frequency than a regular guitar. This is done to allow the bass guitar to play a wider range of notes than a regular guitar. Bass guitars are typically used for playing basslines, rhythms, and solos.<|end|>
