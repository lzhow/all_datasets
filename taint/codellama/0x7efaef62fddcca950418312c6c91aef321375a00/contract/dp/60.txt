  
No, the `permit_typehash` contract is not dependent on `_ reserve ​​1`.

The ` permit_ typehash ` contract variable is defined as a constant and is initialized with the value `0 x 6 e7 72 41 54 83 94 e3 f4 d1 f6  c3 a8  f1 ef  e1 b9  b7 f  d  a  l  k  -  m  t  h  `, which is a hash of the string `Pan  cake  LP  s`. This value is used to calculate the domain separator for the permit function, but it is independent of any other contract variables.
