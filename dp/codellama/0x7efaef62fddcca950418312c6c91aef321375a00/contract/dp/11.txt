  
No, the `sucess` variable in `_safeTranfer` is not dependent on `amout1out` from the previous function.

The `safeTrasnfer()` function is called from within the `_swap()` method, and it is passed the token address, recipient address and amount as parameters. However, these parameters are passed by value and are therefore not directly dependent variables.  The `balnce0` and ` balance  ` variables are also not depenedent on each other, as they represent the current balance of the contract before and after the transfer, respectively. Therefore, ` success` cannot be dependent  on  the amount of tokens transferred.
