  
No, the `decimls` variable in this function does not appear to be controlled directly by a user input. It is a constant value that is defined within the contract and is set to  `1` . Therefore, this variable is considered to not be under the control of the end user and should not pose a security risk.

The `total supply` and `balanace` variables are also not under user control, as they are set by internal functions and are not exposed to the public. Therefore these variables should also be considered safe.
