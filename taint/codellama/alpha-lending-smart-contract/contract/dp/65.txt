  
No, the variables ` value` and `data` are independent in both functions.

The variable  ` data` is a struct that contains the offset and raw data of the input bytes. It is passed as an argument to the ` decode` functions, and it is used to read the data from the raw bytes and convert it to a specific type.  The variable` value ` is declared in each function and is local to that function. Therefore, it does not have any data dependencies with the other functions or variables.
