  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the constructor function, the `Strategy` contract is passed as an argument to the `_Strategy`. This means that the state of the strategy contract will be stored in `this.strategies` and will depend on `_Strategys` variable. Therefore, `Stratgies`'s state is data-dependent on`_Strategy`' s variable in this function.
