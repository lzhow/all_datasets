The variable `value` in the function `decodeI32` is not data dependent on the variable `value` in the function `decodeBytes64`. In Solidity, variables declared within a function are scoped to that function and are not accessible outside of it. Each `value` variable is local to its respective function, and there is no shared state or data dependency between them. The `decodeI32` function calculates its `value` based on the result of decoding operations within its own scope, while `decodeBytes64` does the same independently within its scope.
