No. The variable `blockNumber` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `j_scope_0` in the function `claimRewards`. The value of `blockNumber` is obtained from the `getBlockNumber()` function, which does not depend on any variables or states in the `claimRewards` function. Therefore, the data dependency relationship between these two variables is unknown.
