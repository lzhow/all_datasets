Reason: The variables `amount1In` and `amount0In` in the `swap` function of the `PancakePair` contract are calculated independently from each other. They are both derived from the contract's reserves (`_reserve0` and `_reserve1`) and the amounts going out (`amount0Out` and `amount1Out`), but there is no direct data dependency between them. Each variable represents the amount of a specific token that is being input into the swap function, and their values are determined by the difference between the new balance after the swap and the previous reserve, for their respective tokens. The calculations for `amount0In` and `amount1In` do not reference each other and are separate, thus they are not data dependent.
