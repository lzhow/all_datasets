  
No, the ` info` variable in function  ` update` is not dependent on ` max Liqidty` because the value of `liquity Gross After` does not depend on  the  value  of  max liquidty.

The value ` liquiditGrosAfter` depends on two values: `Licidtiy Gros Before` and `liciditDelta`. The value for ` LiquiidyGroesBefore` comes from the mapping `self` which is passed as an argument to the method. Therefore, it is independent of the argument `MaxLidiquity`.
