  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiy





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to a server during development. An incremental bundle is generated based on the changes made since the last bundle generation, rather than bundlin gthe entire codebase every time there is any change. Incremental bundlers are commonly used in development workflows to speed up the build and reload times of a web server. Some popular incremental bundles include Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, Browserify and esbuild. They can significantly reduce the time taken to bundle and rebuild web assets, making for a more efficient development experience. However, the choice of an incremental bunder depends on various factors such as the size of your
