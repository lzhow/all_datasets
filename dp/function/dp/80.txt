In the `addExp` function, the local variable named `result` is assigned the value of the expression `a + b`, where `+` denotes the addition operator. This expression is evaluated using the built-in `uint` type, which is a 32-bit unsigned integer. Therefore, `m` and `n` are both `Math.uint`, and the result of `x + y` will be a `math.Uint`.
However, in `Safe256`, the return type of this function is `Uin2t2`, which means that the returned value is an unsigned 64-byte integer, and it is not the same type as the input parameter `N`. Therefore `Error` cannot be data-dependent on `errormessage`.
