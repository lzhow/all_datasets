Yes

The variable `partitionManagerImplementation` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` is data dependent on the variable `toPartitionPrefix` in the same function. The reason for this is that `partitionManagerImplementation` is assigned a value based on the result of a call to `interfaceAddr`, which takes `toPartitionPrefix` as part of its arguments. The `toPartitionPrefix` is used to construct the interface name that is passed to `interfaceAddr`. Therefore, any changes to `toPartitionPrefix` would affect the value of `partitionManagerImplementation`.
