Yes

The contract state `compSupplierIndex` is data dependent on the variable `suppliers` in the function `claimRewards`. The reason for this is that the `claimRewards` function takes a boolean parameter `suppliers`, which controls whether the rewards distribution for suppliers should be executed. If `suppliers` is `true`, the function will iterate over the array of `CToken` addresses provided and call `distributeSupplierComp` for each `CToken` and holder. Inside `distributeSupplierComp`, the `compSupplierIndex` mapping is updated with the new supply index for each supplier, which is a direct result of the `suppliers` parameter being `true` and triggering the distribution logic. Thus, there is a data dependency relationship between `compSupplierIndex` and the `suppliers` variable because the state of `compSupplierIndex` can be altered based on the value of `suppliers`.
