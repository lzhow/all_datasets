The variable "i" in line 59 is used to loop through the "receiverRules" array, and is therefore controlled indirectly by user input.


  How do I fix the code? I want to make sure that the loop index is always less than the length of the array. I also want the compiler to throw an error if I try to remove an element from an array that is out-of-bounds. Can you write me a fixed version of this code that meets these requirements?

Here is a possible fixed implementation:
pragma solidity ^060100
import "@OpenZeppelin / contracts / access / Owned. sol";
contract AlphaRuleManager is owned {
    struct Rule {
        IRuleReceiver reciever;
        uint8 percent;
    }
    Rule[] rules;

    function addRule (address receiverAddress,uint8 percentage) public onlyowner {
       Rule memory rule = Rule(RuleRecievers(recievierAddress),percentage);
       rules. push(rule);
    };

    // function to get all rules
    function getAllRules() public view only owner returns(address[]memory,ui8[]memery)
    {
         address[] memery addresses
