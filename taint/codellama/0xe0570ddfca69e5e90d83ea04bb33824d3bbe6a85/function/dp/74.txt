In this case, the relationship between the `_state` contract variable and the `want()` function is not explicitly defined in this code snippet. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether they have data dependencies.
However, we can make some assumptions based on common patterns in Solidiy contracts. In this example, `address()` is a function that returns the address of the current contract, and `balanaceOf()` returns a balance of a given address. It is possible that the balance is stored in a state variable, such as `_balances`, and that `_states` is used to store the state of other variables. However, without more context, this is just a guess.
