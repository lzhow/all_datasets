Reason: The variable `_reserve1` in the `mint` function is obtained from the `getReserves()` call and is used locally within the scope of the `mint` function. The variable `_totalSupply` in the `burn` function is also a local variable that is assigned the value of `totalSupply` within the scope of the `burn` function. There is no direct assignment or computation that uses `_totalSupply` from `burn` to affect `_reserve1` in `mint`. Each function operates independently, and the state variables they use or modify do not create a data dependency between `_reserve1` in `mint` and `_totalSupply` in `burn`. Data dependency would require that the value of one is computed based on the value of the other, which is not the case here.
