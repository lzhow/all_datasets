The variable `protocolFeeSignature` in the function `execute` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount`. The reason for this is that `protocolFeeSignature` is used in the `validateProtocolFeeSignature` function, which is called within the `execute` function. The `validateProtocolFeeSignature` function checks if the protocol fee details provided in `protocolFeeSignature` match the expected values, which are indirectly determined by the input amount being transferred or swapped, as the protocol fee could be a percentage of the input amount.

The `amount` variable in `getAbsoluteInputAmount` represents the absolute amount of tokens to be used in the transaction. This amount is used to calculate the `absoluteInputAmount` which is then used in the `handleInput` function, which is also called within the `execute` function. The `handleInput` function is responsible for transferring the input tokens, and the amount of tokens transferred can affect the protocol fee calculation, as the protocol fee could be a function of the transaction value.

Therefore, the `protocolFeeSignature` depends on the `amount` because the protocol fee calculated and validated could be related to the amount of tokens involved in the transaction, which is determined by the `getAbsoluteInputAmount` function.
