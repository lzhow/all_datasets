  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getAmountoutUniversial` function, the value of `reserveIn` and ` reserveout` are calculated using the values of the variables `from`and `to`. These variables are passed as arguments to the`getReserve`function.
On the other hand, in ` baseunitToCureveDecim`al function , the amount of`result `is calculated by dividing the number of decisions by the decimation of an asset. This value is then multiplied by 1e16 and divided by1 e12.  The value `decimalValue` is assigned to ` result`.
Therefore, ` amountout `in ` getamountoutuniversal`is data-dependent on ` resul`t in` baseunittocurvedecima`l.
