Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_name` is not present in the provided Solidity contract code. The ERC20 token name is typically set during the contract's deployment and is not changed afterwards. It is usually a state variable that is set once in the constructor and does not depend on the function parameters or variables used in other functions. Since `_name` is not a variable or state within the given contract, it cannot have a data dependency relationship with `erc1155Ids` or any other variable in the `buyNFTs` function. Additionally, `erc1155Ids` is a parameter of the `buyNFTs` function used for processing the purchase of ERC1155 tokens and does not interact with a non-existent `_name` state.
