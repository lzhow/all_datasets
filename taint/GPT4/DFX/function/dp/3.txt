Explanation: The variable `_success` in the function `delegate` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `intakeNumeraire`. This is because the value of `_success` is determined by the result of the delegatecall operation, which takes `_data` as an input. Therefore, any changes in the value of `data` will affect the value of `_success`.
