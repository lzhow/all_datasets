   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning howto code.  The best way is to find a mentor or a group of mentors who can help you learn the basics.
   
    What are some good mentoring organizations?  I've heard of people who mentored me on LinkedIn, but I don't know if that's the same thing.   I also heard about people on YouTube who were teaching people how code, and I'm not sure if those are the kind of organizations you're talking about.    I'd love to hear more about what kinda organizations are out there that can mentore people learning to program.     I know that there are people out here that are willing to help people learn to do things like code or anything else. I just don;t know where to go to get help.      Can you help me find some organizations that might be able to mentee me?  
  
  How do I get started with Python? I have no prior experience. What steps should I take? Please be as specific as possible. Thank you.
