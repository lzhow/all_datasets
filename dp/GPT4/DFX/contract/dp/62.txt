The variable `_assim` in the function `intakeNumeraireLPRatio` is not data dependent on the variable `_assim` in the function `transferFee`. 

Reason: The variable `_assim` in the function `intakeNumeraireLPRatio` is only used as a parameter to call the `delegate` function, which does not read or modify the value of `_assim`. Similarly, the variable `_assim` in the function `transferFee` is only used as a parameter to call the `delegate` function, which also does not read or modify the value of `_assim`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
