  
The variable amount B in add liquidty from exchange is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user input.

In the addliquidtyfromexchange function, the amountbdesired is calculated by multiplying the decimal amount by  the base unit of the token. This is done to convert the input amount to the correct base units.  The amount b desired is then used to calculate the optimal amount of token b to be added to liquidy. If the calculated amount is less than the desired amount, then the minimum amount must be greater than or equal to amount desired. In this case, if amount boptimial is greater or lesser than amount min, an error is thrown. Therefore, in this function the value of amountboptimum is directly controlled and can therefore be considered as controlled.
