In the given code, the `userPooldata` is a contract storage variable, which is used to store the user's borrow shares.
`userBorrowsShare` variable is assigned the value of `borrowsshare` of the `_token` address in `address(token)` in userpool data.  The `calculateRoundedUpAmount` function is called with the token and the borrow share as arguments. This function calculates the compounded borrow balance of a user. Therefore, `equilibrium` depends on `_User` because it is calculated based on user borrowing.
