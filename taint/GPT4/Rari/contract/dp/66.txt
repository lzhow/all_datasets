Label: no

Reason: The variable `i` in the function `checkCToken` is a loop iterator used within the scope of the `for` loop in that function to iterate over the `distributors` array. It is used to determine if the current contract address is in the list of distributors by comparing each element of the `distributors` array to `address(this)`.

On the other hand, the variable `compSpeed` in the function `updateContributorRewards` is a parameter of that function, representing the speed at which rewards are accrued for a contributor. It is used to calculate the new accrued amount of rewards for the contributor based on the number of blocks that have passed since the last update.

There is no direct or indirect relationship between `i` and `compSpeed` as they are used in completely separate contexts within the contract. The value of `i` does not influence `compSpeed`, nor does `compSpeed` have any effect on `i`. They operate independently in their respective functions, and changes to one do not affect the other.
