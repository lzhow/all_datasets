The contract state `admin` is data dependent on the variable `newAdmin` in the function `changeAdmin`. This is because within the `changeAdmin` function, the state variable `admin` is directly assigned the value of the local variable `newAdmin`. The line `admin = newAdmin;` establishes a direct data dependency, as the state of `admin` is being updated based on the value passed to `newAdmin`.
