  
The label is 'No'.

In this case, the `divCeiling` function is a library function defined in a Solidiy contract. It takes two arguments `a` and `b` as input and returns the ceiling of the division of ` a` by ` b`. The function uses the require statement to check that `  b` is greater than zero. However, this check does not ensure that the value of  `   b ` is user-controlled.
  The value `    b  can be set by any user who calls the  function. Therefore,  the answer is no.
