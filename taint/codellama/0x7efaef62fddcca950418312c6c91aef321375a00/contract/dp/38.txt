  
No, the variables ` liquid` and ` balance` are independent.

The variable liquid is defined as the amount of liquidty that is burned in a transaction. It is calculated based on a number of factors, including the total supply of the liquid token and the current reserves of each token in circulation.  The variable balance is also defined in terms of a token's current balance, but it is not directly related to the burn function. Instead, it represents the balance of tokens that are currently in existence. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
