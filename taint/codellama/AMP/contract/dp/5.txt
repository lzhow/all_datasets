  
No, the variables ` partition ManagerImplemenation` and ` to PartitonPrefix ` are independent.

The variable `_partitionPrefix_` is defined in function ` _ callPost TransferHooKs` as the prefix of the partition where the tokens are being transferred. This prefix is used to determine the implementation of a partition strategy validator, which is stored in variable  `PartitioNManager Implementation`.
However, this implementation is not dependent on `_to PartionPrefix`, as it is determined by the value of `_from ParttionPrefix`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between these two variable.
