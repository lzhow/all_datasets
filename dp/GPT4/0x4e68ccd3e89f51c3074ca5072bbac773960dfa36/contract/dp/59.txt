Label: no

Reason: The variable `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` in the function `cross` is not data dependent on the variable `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` in the same function. In the `cross` function, `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` is used to update the `secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128` field of the `info` struct by subtracting the current `info.secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128` from it. On the other hand, `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` is used to update the `feeGrowthOutside1X128` field of the `info` struct by subtracting the current `info.feeGrowthOutside1X128` from it. These two operations are independent of each other and there is no computation in the function `cross` that creates a data dependency between `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` and `feeGrowthGlobal1X128`. Each variable is used in a separate and unrelated calculation for different fields within the `info` struct.
