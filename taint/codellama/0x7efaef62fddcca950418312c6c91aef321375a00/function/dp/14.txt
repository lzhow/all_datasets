The variable 'value' in function `_safeTranfer` is not dependent on variable '_totalSuplly'  because the value of ' value' is passed as an argument to the `_ safeTranser` function. It is also not dependant on `_reserver0` or `_reverser1` because it is calculated using the `balances` of the tokens and the current `_mints` and `_burns` .
