Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` is an input parameter that is used to determine if the address provided is a contract. It is independent of any other function's variables. The variable `target` in the function `functionDelegateCall` is also an input parameter that represents the address on which the delegate call will be performed. There is no direct relationship or data flow between `account` and `target` within the given code snippet. Each function operates on its own parameters, and there is no code indicating that the value of `account` is derived from or affects the value of `target`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
