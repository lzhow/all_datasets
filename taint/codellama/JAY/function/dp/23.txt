  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `uint265 eth` variable is assigned the value of `JAytoEth( value)` which is a function call that takes the input ` value` as an argument. Therefore, ` eth ` is data-dependent on `  value`.
Similarly, in function 2 ` uint  eth  ` variable  is also assigned a value ` JAToET(  Value )` which takes ` Value`as an input.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on variable value.
