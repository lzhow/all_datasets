  
No, the ` data` variable in function `_safeTranfer` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function argument.

The ` _ safeTranser` function is called by other functions in this contract, and the data argument is passed to it. Therefore, `  data ` is a variable that is defined by another function and is used as an argument in `_ safeTansfer`.
