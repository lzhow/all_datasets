  
No, the variables `_implentation` and `_dif` are independent.

The variable  `_implemenation` is a local variable in function  ` propose Strategy` that is used to store the address of the new strategy implementation. It is only used within the scope of this function and is never accessed outside of it. Therefore, it is independent of any other variable.  On the other hand, variable _difference is also a  local  variable that stores the difference between the current balance of want tokens and the amount of tokens that need to be withdrawn. This variable is calculated based on other variables such as the total supply of shares and  the balance  of  want  tokens  but it does not depend on any external variable such  as `_ implementation`. Therefore it  is label as 'No'
