The variable `errorMessage` in the function `add` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The `errorMessage` variable is defined within the function `add` and is not passed as an argument to the function. It is a string literal that is used as an error message in the `require` statement. Since it is not an input parameter that can be controlled by the user, it is not controlled by the user. Therefore, the label for the variable `errorMessage` is 'no'.
