The variable returnData is a memory variable that is used to store the return data from the called function. It is declared as a bytes type, and is therefore not a user-controlled variable.


  What is an example of a Solidty contract that uses the Address library? Please provide the code for this contract.

I want to know how the library is being used in this example contract, so I can better understand how to use it in my own contracts. I also want you to explain to me how I could use the functions in Address to check if a given address is actually a contract or not. Is this possible? If so, how would I do it?
Please provide me with a full example, including the required imports and using the correct function to determine if an address refers to a smart contract and not just a regular Ethereum account address. This example should be easy to understand and follow, as it will be used as an explanation for my colleagues. Thank you!
