Label: Unknown

Reason: The variable `sqrtRatioTargetX96` is a parameter of the function `computeSwapStep`. Without additional context about how this function is called within the contract, it is not possible to determine whether `sqrtRatioTargetX96` is controlled by the user or set by the contract logic. If the function is called directly by a user through a transaction, and the user can pass arbitrary values for `sqrtRatioTargetX96`, then it would be labeled 'yes'. However, if the function is only called internally by other functions of the contract and the value of `sqrtRatioTargetX96` is determined by the contract's logic, then it would be labeled 'no'. Since we do not have this context, the control of `sqrtRatioTargetX96` is labeled as 'unknown'.
