In the `function` buy Jay, the parameter `address[]` `callddata` erC 7 2 5 6 Token Address is passed to the internal function`buuJaYWithErC`1 9 4 8.
This function takes the address of the ERC-1958 token as a parameter.  The address is used to call the safeTranserFrom function of IErc- 3  E  R C  -1-5-8, which is a function that transfers tokens from one address to another. This function is called in a loop, and the loop variable is incremented by one each time the transfer is made. Therefore, this function depends on `erC3E5E8Token Address`.
