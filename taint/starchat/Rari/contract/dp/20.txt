The contract has a function called `claimRewards` that allows users to claim their COMP rewards. This function takes two parameters: `holders` and `ctokens`. The `holder` parameter is an array of addresses that the user wants to receive their rewards for, and the `ctokens` array is a list of ctokens that they want to check for rewards in.

When the claim rewards function is called, it loops through each ctoken in `ctokens` to see if there are any rewards available. If there is, the code loops again through the holdlers array to distribute the rewards to each holder.
