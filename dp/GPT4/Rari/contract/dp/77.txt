Label: no

Reason: The variable `supplier` in the function `distributeSupplierComp` is used to calculate and distribute rewards to a supplier based on the supply state and the supplier's index. It is not directly influenced by the `compSpeed` variable in the function `_setContributorCompSpeed`. The `compSpeed` variable in `_setContributorCompSpeed` is used to set the speed at which a contributor accrues rewards, which is a separate mechanism from the distribution of rewards to suppliers. There is no direct data flow or dependency between the `supplier` variable in `distributeSupplierComp` and the `compSpeed` variable in `_setContributorCompSpeed`.
