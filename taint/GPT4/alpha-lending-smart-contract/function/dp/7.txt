The variable `liquidityBalanceBase` is directly calculated from the variable `compoundedLiquidityBalance` within the same function `getUserAccount`. The line `uint256 liquidityBalanceBase = poolPricePerUnit.wadMul(compoundedLiquidityBalance);` shows that `liquidityBalanceBase` is assigned a value that is the result of a multiplication operation (`wadMul`) between `poolPricePerUnit` and `compoundedLiquidityBalance`. This establishes a clear data dependency relationship between `liquidityBalanceBase` and `compoundedLiquidityBalance`, as the value of `liquidityBalanceBase` is derived from the value of `compoundedLiquidityBalance`.
