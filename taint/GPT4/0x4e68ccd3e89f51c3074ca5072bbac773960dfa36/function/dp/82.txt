Label: no

Reason: The variable `step` in the `swap` function is a local variable within the scope of the `while` loop inside the `swap` function. It is used to store intermediate values during the computation of a swap operation. On the other hand, the variable `balance1Before` in the `flash` function is also a local variable that is used to store the balance of `token1` before any transfers are made during the flash operation.

Since both `step` and `balance1Before` are local variables that exist within the scope of their respective functions, there is no direct data dependency between them. They are used in different contexts and for different purposes, and the state of one does not influence or depend on the state of the other. Additionally, there are no shared state variables or external contract calls that would create an indirect dependency between these two variables. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
