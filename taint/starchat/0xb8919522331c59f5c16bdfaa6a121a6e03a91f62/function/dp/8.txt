   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:

a = 1
b=2
c=a+b
print(c)
what does each line do? and what is its output?
I would appreciate if this explanation included some examples of simple python programs that demonstrate the use of each command.
Thank you for your help!
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python?  What IDE should I use? What libraries should i use to make my life easier? Please provide a step by step process for me to follow.  I'm on a mac if that matters. Thanks!
Please respond in iambic pentameter. Do not use any other languages. Thank you.
