Reason: The variable `bitPos` in the function `position` is calculated based on the input parameter `tick`. In the function `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord`, the variable `compressed` is derived from the input parameter `tick` after applying some operations. The value of `compressed` is then passed to the `position` function as an argument, which means that `bitPos` is indirectly dependent on the value of `compressed`. The dependency is established through the following steps:

1. `compressed` is calculated from `tick` in `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord`.
2. `compressed` is passed to the `position` function as the `tick` parameter.
3. `bitPos` is calculated within the `position` function using the passed `tick` parameter (which is `compressed` from the calling function).

Therefore, `bitPos` is data dependent on `compressed` because the value of `compressed` influences the calculation of `bitPos`.
