  
The variable _ sell Nft Fee Eth is not dependent on price in function UpdateFeatures.

This is because the value of _Sell NFT FEE ET is calculated using the price of the JPY token, which is obtained from the Chainlink price feed. This price is used to calculate the Ether fee for selling NTFs, but it is never directly used in any calculations involving the ` price` variable. Therefore, the two are independent.
