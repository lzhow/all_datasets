  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_transerByParition` function, the `bytes memory` variable named `_value` is passed as an argument to the internal function ` _calPretransfHooke`s. This means that the value of `_operatordata` can be determined by the values of the variables `_from`, `_to`, and `_val`ue in `_calpretransfershooks`. Therefore, `_ operatordata ` is data-dependent on `_ data` .
