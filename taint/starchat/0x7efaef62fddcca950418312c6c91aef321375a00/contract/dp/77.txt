The contract has 4 state variables: `reserve`, `blocktimestamplast`, and `klast`. The function `_update` updates the `priceCummulativeLast` and the two reserves.

`Reserve0`, `_Reserve1`,  and `_blockTimeStampLast ` are all derived from the state variable `Reserve`.
Therefore, `TotalSupply`, the first state in `GetReservse` is data-dependent on `_reserv0`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data dependence is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value depends on another. In the context of smart contracts, it refers to how a particular value or variable is used to calculate or determine another value. For example, if a variable x is set to the value of another variable y, then x and y are said to have data dependences.
