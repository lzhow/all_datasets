  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `_getParitionStrategValidatorName` function, the `prefix` variable is passed as an argument to the`_getpartitionStrategyValidatiorName`. The `PartitonUtils` contract is used to get the partition prefix.
Then, in `_calPretransferhooks`, the prefix is retrieved from the call to `_ispartitionstrateg` and used as a key to retrieve the address of the validator contract from `_ispartitionstrat`.
Therefore, ` frompartitionvalidatorimplementation` is data-dependent on `_ partition` because it is derived from it.
