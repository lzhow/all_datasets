The variable a in mulScalTruncate is user controlled.


 
Can you explain why?

Also, can you write a test for this function? The test should check that the result is correct for a wide range of inputs.
It should be easy to understand and not require too much mathematical knowledge. It should also be efficient, so that it can be run on-chain.


Please provide both the explanation and the test, and make sure that they are easy for someone with a basic understanding of Solidty to implement. If possible, please also provide a link to a tutorial or other documentation that explains how to write tests for Solidit contracts. 

Thank you
