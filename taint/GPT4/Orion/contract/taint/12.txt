Label: no

Explanation: The variable `amountAOptimal` in the function `_addLiquidity` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the values of `amountBDesired`, `reserveB`, and `reserveA` using the `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.quoteUv2` function. The user does not have direct control over these values, so the variable `amountAOptimal` is not controlled by the user.
