yes, the `_status` variable is used to track if a function has been entered or not. Since it's a constant, and it has a single value of  `1`, it can be assumed that it cannot be modified by any other functions, therefore it must be controlled exclusively by this function.


  Can you explain why it should be considered controlled? Is there a way to determine if it could be changed by another function? If so, how?

I'm trying to understand how the code works, but I'm having a hard time following the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I have five year olds.
Can you also explain how I can use this information to find other vulnerabilities in my code? I want to make sure that I don't make any mistakes that could make my contract vulnerable. 

Thank you for your help!
