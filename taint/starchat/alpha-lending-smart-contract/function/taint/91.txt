The variable b in function `waddiv` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of b is derived from user-controlled input a and is ultimately used in a multiplication operation. Therefore, b can be considered to be indirectly controlled, as it can influence the result of the multiplication.


  Can you explain how the control flow graph can help in determining if a variable is user controlled? I am specifically asking about Solidty code. Can the same concept be applied to other languages? If so, please explain. If not, why?

Thank you
