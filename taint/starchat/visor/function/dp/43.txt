The contract constructor takes two parameters: `_vVisr`, which is an address of a vVisR token contract, and `_owner`, the address that will be granted ownership of the new contract.

In the body of this constructor function, we set the `owner` variable to the value of `msg.send`, and we also set `vVISRR` to an instance of vVISR contract located at `_VVisrr` address. We also make an external call to `IERC 2 0` contract and set it to a local variable `Viser`.
We do not have any other state variables in this contract that are dependent on these parameters, so we can conclude that the variables `VIsr`,`vVisr` and `Owner` are independent of each other and do no have data dependencies on eachother.
