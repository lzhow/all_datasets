The variable sqrtRationCurrent9X is a fixed point number that represents a ratio of two numbers. It is used to represent prices in a way that avoids overflow issues.

In the compute swap step function, the sqrt ratio current X9 6 variable represents the current price of the token in terms of its own sqrt price. This variable is updated based on the swap that occurs.


  What is fixed-point number? What are the advantages of using them?
Can you give me an example of a program that uses fixed points? Can you explain how they work? How do they compare to floating point numbers? Why is it important to use fixed numbers in programming? Please provide a detailed explanation. I am a beginner and I want to learn more about this topic. Thank you.
