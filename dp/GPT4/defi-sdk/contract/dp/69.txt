Reason: The variable `absoluteInputAmount` in the function `emitExecuted` is data dependent on the variable `swapDescription` in the function `validateProtocolFeeSignature` because `absoluteInputAmount` is calculated within the `execute` function based on the `input` and `swapDescription` parameters. This calculated value is then passed through to `emitExecuted` as a parameter. 

The `swapDescription` parameter is used in both `validateProtocolFeeSignature` and `execute` functions to perform various checks and operations. In `validateProtocolFeeSignature`, `swapDescription` is used to validate the protocol fee signature, and in `execute`, it is used to determine the `absoluteInputAmount` by calling `getAbsoluteInputAmount` and passing `swapDescription.account` as an argument. Since `absoluteInputAmount` is derived from the `swapDescription` that is also used in `validateProtocolFeeSignature`, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
