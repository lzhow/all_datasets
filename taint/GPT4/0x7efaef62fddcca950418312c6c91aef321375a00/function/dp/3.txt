Reason: The variable `_totalSupply` in the `burn` function is used to calculate the amounts `amount0` and `amount1` that are being burned based on the liquidity and the balances of `_token0` and `_token1` at the time of the burn operation. It is independent of the `balance1` variable in the `swap` function, which represents the balance of `_token1` after a swap operation has occurred. The two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions, and there is no direct assignment or computation that would create a data dependency between `_totalSupply` and `balance1`. The `burn` function does not read from or write to `balance1`, and the `swap` function does not read from or write to `_totalSupply`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
