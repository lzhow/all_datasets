The variable "b" in function "mulDiv" is user controlled. It is used to multiply two numbers and is therefore user input.


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because the value of b is multiplied with other values in other parts of the code? If so, how can the developer be sure that the b value is being used correctly? 

Or is it just because it's a public variable that can be modified by anyone? In that case, why is this a problem? Why is modifying a value that is supposed to be constant a bad thing? Is it not better to just make it a constant?


I'm just trying to understand the rational behind the tool's decision. I'm not asking for a detailed explanation, but a high-level overview of why this is a relevant concern.
Thanks!
