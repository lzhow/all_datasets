Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `swap`, the contract state `balanceOf` for `_token0` and `_token1` is queried and the resulting values are stored in the variables `balance0` and `balance1` respectively. Later in the function, `balance0Adjusted` is calculated using the value of `balance0`:

```solidity
uint balance0Adjusted = (balance0.mul(10000).sub(amount0In.mul(25)));
```

Since `balance0Adjusted` is directly computed using `balance0`, which in turn is derived from the contract state `balanceOf`, there is a data dependency relationship between the contract state `balanceOf` and the variable `balance0Adjusted`. Changes to the `balanceOf` state will affect the value of `balance0`, which will consequently affect the value of `balance0Adjusted`.
