  
The variable _ assetWeight is a local variable in function New Curves. It is created using the new keyword and is therefore controlled only by that function. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In the code, we can see that the _ assets variable is also created locally using new. However, this variable does not appear to be used in any way that would allow the caller to control its value.
