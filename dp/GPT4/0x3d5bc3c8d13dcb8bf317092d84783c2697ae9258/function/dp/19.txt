Reason: The variable `numerator` in the function `divScalarByExp` is calculated within that function using the result of the `mulUInt` function, which takes `expScale` and `scalar` as arguments. There is no direct reference to the variable `b` from the function `mulExp` within `divScalarByExp`. The two variables are in separate functions and there is no indication from the provided code snippet that the result of `mulExp` (which involves `b`) is passed to or influences the calculation of `numerator` in any way. Therefore, `numerator` is not data dependent on `b`.
