Reason: The variable `value` in the function `_safeTransfer` is an argument passed to the function when it is called, and it represents the amount of tokens to be transferred. It is independent of the context of the `skim` function. The variable `_token1` in the `skim` function is a local variable that holds the address of token1, which is used to identify the token contract for the purpose of transferring tokens. There is no direct relationship or computation in the code provided that would cause `value` to be dependent on `_token1`. The `_safeTransfer` function could be called with any value and any token address, and its behavior would not change based on the state or value of `_token1` in the `skim` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `value` in `_safeTransfer` and `_token1` in `skim`.
