   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how bundlers work and which one to use. Thanks!
  
   An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bundl ingtogether all the assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, and HTML files) into a single file that can be served to users. This helps reduce the number of requests made to servers when a web page is loaded, which can significantly improve the page load time.

   The key feature of an incremental bundle tool like Webpack is that it can automatically detect which files have changed since the last build, only rebuilding those files that have been modified. By doing so, the incremental build process can save a significant amount of time and resources, especially for larger projects. Additionally, Webpack can also optimize and compress the bundled assets, reducing the amount data that needs to be sent to clients
