The function "add" has two parameters "x" and "y". The function checks if the sum of "z" (which is "return value") and the value of x is greater than or equal to the original value "X" of X. This is done by comparing the result of the comparison "Y >=0" with the expression "(z=x+y)>=x".

If we look at the first line of code, we can see that the "require" statement is comparing "Z" to "((X+Y) - X)". This means that if "(((X + Y) + X))" is less than "((((X) * 2)  + (Y)) + 1))", then the program will revert.
This means the statement "if (z >=x ==(y>=0)) {" is essentially checking if "(X-X)==(Y-Y)" which is always true. Therefore, the data dependence relationship between " z " and y is unknown.


  Can you explain what "data dependancy" means in this context?
 
  Data dependancies are relationships between variables that are determined at runtime. In the context of smart contracts, data dependencies
