  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `xp` array is defined as a local variable, and it is used to calculate the value of `y`. The `i` and `j` variables are also defined locally and are used in conjunction with the array `yp` to determine the values of the variables `A`, `B`, and`C`.
However, in function two, `factory` is passed as an argument, which is not used.
Therefore, we can conclude that the data in ` pool` depends on ` x` because it depends directly on it.
