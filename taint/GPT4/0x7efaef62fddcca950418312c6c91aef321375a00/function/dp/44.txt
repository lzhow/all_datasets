Reason: The variable `token` in the function `_safeTransfer` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called. It is not directly dependent on the variable `_token1` in the function `burn`. The `_safeTransfer` function could be called with any address, and it does not have to be the `_token1` address from the `burn` function. There is no direct assignment or computation in the provided code that links `token` to `_token1`, hence there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables based on the given code snippet.
