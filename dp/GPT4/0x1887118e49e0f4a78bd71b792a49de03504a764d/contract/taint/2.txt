Reason: The variable `oracles` is a mapping that associates addresses with PriceOracle contracts. It is modified by the `add` function and the constructor of the `MasterPriceOracle` contract. Both the constructor and the `add` function are protected by the `onlyAdmin` modifier, which restricts access to the `admin` of the contract. The `admin` is set upon contract deployment and can only be changed by the current `admin` through the `changeAdmin` function, which is also protected by the `onlyAdmin` modifier. Since only the `admin` can modify the `oracles` mapping and the `admin` is not necessarily a user-controlled address (it could be another contract or a specific privileged account), the `oracles` mapping is not directly controlled by a general user.
