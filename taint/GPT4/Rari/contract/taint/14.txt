Explanation: The variable `borrowSpeeds` in the function `_setCompSpeeds` is not controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function `_setCompSpeeds` and is only accessed within the function. The value of `borrowSpeeds` is determined by the caller of the function, which is not the user. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
