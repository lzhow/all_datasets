Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_totalSupply` is not present in the provided Solidity code. The `totalSupply()` function is a standard ERC20 public view function that returns the total supply of the token, but it is not directly modified within the `updateFees` function. The variable `_price` within the `updateFees` function is used to calculate the new fees based on the latest price from the `priceFeed`. There is no direct data dependency between `_totalSupply` and `_price` as `_totalSupply` is not altered based on `_price` within the `updateFees` function or anywhere else in the provided code.
