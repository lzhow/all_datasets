The variable _Reserve1 in function MINT is NOT controlled directly by user input. However, the value of _Reserver1 is determined by a calculation that involves the values of reserve  and balance of token  which are both user controlled.


  How can I make sure that the contract is secure? I'm a bit worried that it's not as secure as it could be. Can you give me some tips on how to make it more secure and prevent hackers from exploiting the vulnerabilities?

I'm especially worries about the SWAP function, since it seems like it can be abused by hacker to drain all the funds from the smart contract.

Thank you in advance for your help!
