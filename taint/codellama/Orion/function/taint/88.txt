In the `safeAutoTranferto` function, the value of the parameter `to`, which is passed as an argument to the Saferc2O.SaferTranser function is used to determine whether the transfer is to or from the contract. If the address of `this` is equal to `from`, then the token is transferred from `token` to`to`. Otherwise the tokens are transferred to a user address.
