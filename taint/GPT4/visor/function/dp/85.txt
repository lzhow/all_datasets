Reason: The variable `snapshotted` in the function `totalSupplyAt` is used to determine whether a snapshot was taken at a given `snapshotId` for the total supply of the token. It is assigned a value based on the result of the `_valueAt` function, which takes `snapshotId` and `_totalSupplySnapshots` as arguments. The variable `amount` in the function `_beforeTokenTransfer` represents the amount of tokens being transferred. There is no direct relationship or data flow between `amount` and `snapshotted` within the given code snippet. The `amount` variable is used for the logic of token transfer and does not influence the snapshot data or the `_totalSupplySnapshots`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
