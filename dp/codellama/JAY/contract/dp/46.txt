  
No, the ` buy Nft Fee Jay ` contract variable is not dependent on ` amounts ` in ` Buy ER C1 5  ` function.

The ` amount ` variable in this function is used to calculate the total amount of NFT tokens to be bought, but it does not affect the value of ` bu yN ftF eeJ ay ` . The value is set in a separate function called ` update Fees ` and is based on external factors such as the current price of the token. Therefore, ` b uy N ft F e eJ a y ` is independent of` amounts `.
