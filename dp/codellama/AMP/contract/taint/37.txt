  
No, the ` total Supply By Partitions` variable is a contract variable and is therefore not directly controlled or modified by a user, but rather by other contract functions.

The `TotalSuppliesBy Partiton` mapping is used to store the total supply of tokens for each partition. It is initialized to  zero in  the constructor and updated by  functions such as `_add TokenTo Partion` and `_remove TokenFrom Parttion`.
  The ` _Total Supplies ByPartitons` is an internal variable, and it can only be accessed and modified within the contract. Therefore, a  user cannot directly modify the value of this variable.
