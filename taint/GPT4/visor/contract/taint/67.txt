Label: unknown

Reason: The function `tryAdd` in the provided Solidity code is an `internal` function, which means it can only be called from within the contract itself or from derived contracts, not directly by an external user. However, without the context of how this function is being used by the contract, it is impossible to determine whether the parameters `a` and `b` that are passed to `tryAdd` are influenced or controlled by user input. If `tryAdd` is called by a public or external function that takes user input as arguments, then `a` and `b` could be controlled by the user. If `tryAdd` is only used internally with fixed or state variables not influenced by user actions, then `a` and `b` would not be controlled by the user. Since the context of usage is not provided, the control over the variables `a` and `b` is unknown.
