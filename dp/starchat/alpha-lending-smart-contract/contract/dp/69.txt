yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_token` parameter in `setPool` is used to index the `pools` mapping, and the value of `pool` at that index is then used in a call to `receiveAlphas`. This means that `_poolTotalBorows` and `_alAmount` are both data-dependent on `_tokens`.


  Can you explain why it's data dependant?
 
  The reason itâ€™s data depends on _tokens is because the mapping pools is indexed by the address of the token.
