  
The variable 'data' in function 'finished' is a local variable and is therefore not user-controlled.

In Solidiy, local variables are not accessible from outside the contract and are only visible within the scope of the current function. Therefore, the value of ' data' cannot be modified by any external user and the state of this variable is determined by its initial value and any changes made within its scope.
