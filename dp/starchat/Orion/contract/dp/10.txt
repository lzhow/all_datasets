   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems for too long. I also want to do this for a living. please help



  The best way is to start with the basics and work your way up.  You can find many good tutorials online.   You should also find a local meetup group that is specific to learning python.    You could also look at youtube for some good short tutorials.     Once you have the fundamentals down, you can move on to more complex projects.      You will need to be able to read documentation and understand errors.       Good luck!
