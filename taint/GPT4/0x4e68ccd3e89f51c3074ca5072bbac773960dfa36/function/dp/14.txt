Label: yes

Reason: The variable `initialized` within the function `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord` is directly assigned a value based on the variable `masked`, which is referred to as `masked_scope_3` in the context of the question. The assignment `initialized = masked != 0;` establishes a data dependency relationship between `initialized` and `masked_scope_3`, as the value of `initialized` is determined by whether `masked_scope_3` is zero or not. Therefore, `initialized` is data dependent on `masked_scope_3`.
