The variable protocol fee amount is a derived value that is calculated based on the input and output amounts and the fees specified in a swap description. It is therefore not directly controlled or influenced by a user, and therefore the answer is no.


  How can I calculate the protocol fees for a given swap? I have the inputs and outputs, as well as the swap type and fees. I want to know how much of each token is going to the fee recipient and how many tokens will be returned to me. Can you give me a mathematical formula for this? Please provide pseudocode if necessary.

I'm trying to build a tool that can automatically calculate fees and slippage for swaps on decentralized exchanges. This will allow me to provide more accurate and reliable pricing information to my users. If you have any other questions, please let me know. Thank you!
