In the `balaceOfUnderyling` function, the value of `exchageRate ` is calculated using the current exchange rate, which is obtained by calling the external function` exchangeRageCurrent()`. This function is not dependent on any variable in `reapayborrowInternal` and therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
