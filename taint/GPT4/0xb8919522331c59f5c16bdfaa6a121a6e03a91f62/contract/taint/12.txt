Label: no

Reason: The variable `success` in the function `getProxyImplementation` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the result of a `staticcall` to the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract. The `staticcall` is used to execute a read-only function (`hex"5c60da1b"`, which corresponds to the `implementation()` function selector) on the proxy contract to get the address of the current implementation. The `success` variable will be `true` if the call was successful, and `false` if it failed (e.g., if the call to the contract reverts). The outcome of this call is determined by the contract's code and state, not by user inputs directly.
