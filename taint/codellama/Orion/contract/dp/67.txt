In the `SaferMath` library, the functions `add`, `sub`, and `mul` are implemented using the same pattern: they first perform the arithmetic operation, and if the result is not within the expected range, it throws an error.
On the other hand, `div` and`mod` use a different pattern. They first check if `a` is zero, then they perform a division or modulus operation. If the operation fails, an exception is thrown.  The `mod()` function is also implemented differently from the others. It checks if`b `is zero before performing the mod operation and throws and error if it is. This is because the`%` operator in Soliidty can cause an underflow error when`a `and` b`are both zero. Therefore, we need to check for this case explicitly.   The`tryAdd()`, ` trysub()`, and  `trymul()` functions are similar to the ones in ` Safer Math`. They perform an arithmetic operations and return the results in a tuple. However, unlike the previous functions, these functions do not throw an erro if an overflow occurs. Instead,they return false and zero as the second element of the tuple, indicating that the addition, substraction, or multiplication operation has failed.   
Therefore, in this code, there is no data dependence between the variables ` b `in the  function` tryadd()` and the varible ` a ` in function  try mod(). The reason is that these two functions have different implementations and do different things. `Tryadd()`,`trysub()`,and ` trymult()` are used to perform arithmetic operatons and check whether the operands are within a certain range. On the contrary,`div()`and  mod()`are used for division and modulous operations, respectively. These two sets of functions operate on different variables and have no direct relationship with each other.
