The variable b in function "add" is not dependent on c in "function add". The reason is that the value of b is only used to calculate the return value c, which is then used as the input to the require statement.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand your answer. Could you please explain it again?
  
  The variable "b" in add() function is dependent of the "c" variable in sub()function. This is because the calculation of "a+b", which will be assigned to " c", is used in a require() statement to check if the result is greater or equal than " a".
