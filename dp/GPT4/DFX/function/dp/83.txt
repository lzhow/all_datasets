Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_amt` in the function `outputRawAndGetBalance` is used as an argument to encode the data in the `abi.encodeWithSelector` function call. This encoded data is then passed as an argument to the `delegate` function. Therefore, the variable `_amt` in the function `outputRawAndGetBalance` has a data dependency on the variable `_amt` in the function `delegate`.
