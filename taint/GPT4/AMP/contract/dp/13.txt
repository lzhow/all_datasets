Yes

The variable `toPartitionPrefix` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` is data dependent on the variable `_toPartition` in the same function. This is because `toPartitionPrefix` is directly derived from `_toPartition` using the function `PartitionUtils._getPartitionPrefix(_toPartition)`. The value of `toPartitionPrefix` is determined by the bits of `_toPartition`, indicating a clear data dependency relationship between the two variables.
