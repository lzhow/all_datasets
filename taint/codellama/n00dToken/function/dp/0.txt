In the constructor function, the `_mInt` function is called, which is a function of the ER727 contract. This function takes three arguments: the address of a recipient, an amount of tokens to mint, a user data string, and a operator data.
  The `msg` variable is used to get the sender of this transaction, so the `sender` is passed as the first argument to `_ mint`. The second argument is ` initial Supply`, which means that the amount to be minted is equal to the value of `InitialSuppy`.
   The third and fourth arguments are empty strings, indicating that there is no user or operator-specific data associated with the minting operation.
