The variable amount B in this function can be controlled if a user is able to manipulate the token B contract. This can occur if they have the ability to call transferFrom on the B token contract, which allows them to transfer tokens from the contract to the liqudity pool.


  How can I mitigate this? Is there a way to check if token transfer is allowed before performing the transfer? If not, how can the owner of the pool be notified if this occurs?

I'm not sure if I'm asking the right questions, but I would appreciate any help you can provide. I am trying to build a decentralized exchange for a token that is pegged to a fiat currency. It is a stablecoin, and the price of stablecoins fluctuates greatly. If a hacker were to take control of my token, they could potentially manipulate its price to their advantage.
How can this be prevented? How do I make sure that the exchange is as decoupled from external factors as possible? I want to minimize the risk of a breach of security. Is it possible to add additional layers of defense to my system to make it more robust? Please let me know if you need any more
