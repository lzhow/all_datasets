  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `uint245 _sharess` is assigned a value based on `_pool` and `total_supply()`. The `_shars` variable is calculated using the `_amout` value, which is passed as an argument to the deposite function. Therefore, `share` depends on `amount`.
Similarly, in function 2, `_share_`is assigned the value of `_after` minus `_ pool`. The value `_ after` comes from the transfer of `want` tokens from `msg_sender` to `address( this)`. Therefore `_ share` also depends  on`_ amount`.
