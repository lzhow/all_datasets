  
No, the ` buy Nft Fee Jay ` contract variable is not dependent on ` value ` in ` sell ` because it is a constant value that is set in a different function.

The ` buynftfeeJ ` variable in this contract is defined as a public variable and is initialized to  ` 9 *1 8 4 * * `, which is an amount of J AY tokens. This value is then used in various functions, such as ` updatefees ` and ` getbuyjayn ft ` to calculate the fee for buying NFT tokens in JYT. However, this value does not depend on any variable or state in any function, including ` sale ` . Therefore, it can be considered an independent variable.
