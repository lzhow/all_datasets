Reason: The variable `_toTimestamp` in the function `calculateLinearInterest` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called. It is used within the function to calculate the linear interest based on the time period between `_fromTimestamp` and `_toTimestamp`. On the other hand, the variable `_user` in the function `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance` is also a parameter that is used to access user-specific data from the `userPoolData` mapping. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `_toTimestamp` and `_user` as shown in the provided code snippet. The value of `_toTimestamp` does not depend on the value of `_user`, nor does the value of `_user` influence the calculation involving `_toTimestamp`. They are used in separate contexts within their respective functions.
