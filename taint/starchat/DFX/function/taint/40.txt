   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to move into a new career. I know some javascript and some c++ but I have never touched python. Can you recommend a few good first steps? And is python worth the time investment? Please respond with bullet points for each question. Thank you.  I also have heard that python is easier to read than javascript. Is this true? If not, why do people still use python then?  Thankyou.   My name is Jane and I live in London
