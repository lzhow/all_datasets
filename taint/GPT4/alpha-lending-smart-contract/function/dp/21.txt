Label: yes

Reason: The variable `poolTotalLiquidity` in the function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount` is calculated by calling the function `getTotalLiquidity(_token)`, which implies that it depends on the input parameter `_token`. In the function `withdrawReserve`, the variable `_token` is also an input parameter that represents the ERC20 token being interacted with. Since both `poolTotalLiquidity` and `_token` in `withdrawReserve` are associated with the same ERC20 token, and the liquidity is a property of the pool associated with that token, there is a data dependency relationship between `poolTotalLiquidity` and `_token`. Changes to the state of the pool associated with `_token` in `withdrawReserve` (such as withdrawing reserves) could affect the total liquidity of the pool, which in turn would affect the value of `poolTotalLiquidity` when `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount` is called with the same `_token`.
