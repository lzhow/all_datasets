Reason: The variable `userUsePoolAsCollateral` in the function `getUserAccount` is determined by the result of the function call `getUserPoolData(_user, _token)`, which takes the user address and a token from the `tokenList` as arguments. This variable is used to calculate `totalCollateralBalanceBase` within the context of the `getUserAccount` function.

On the other hand, the variable `_amount` in the function `sendAlphaReward` is an argument that represents the amount of ALPHA rewards to be sent to a recipient. This function is concerned with the transfer or accumulation of ALPHA tokens to a user's account and does not interact with the `getUserAccount` function or its variables.

There is no direct or indirect interaction or data flow between `userUsePoolAsCollateral` and `_amount` as shown in the provided code snippet. They are used in completely separate functions with different purposes and do not share state or influence each other's values. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
