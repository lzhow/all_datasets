Label: no

Reason: The variable `_operator` in the function `authorizeOperator` is used to set the `_authorizedOperator` mapping to true for the given operator address, indicating that the operator is authorized to act on behalf of `msg.sender`. This variable is independent of the `_data` variable in the function `_transferByPartition`.

The `_data` variable in `_transferByPartition` is used to pass additional data with a token transfer and does not influence the authorization status of an operator. The `_data` variable is used within the function to potentially influence the partition to which tokens are transferred, but it does not have any impact on the `_authorizedOperator` mapping or the `_operator` variable in `authorizeOperator`.

Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_operator` in `authorizeOperator` and `_data` in `_transferByPartition`.
