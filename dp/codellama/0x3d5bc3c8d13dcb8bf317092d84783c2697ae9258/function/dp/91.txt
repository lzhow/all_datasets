  
The label is 'No'.

In the `mulExp` function, the parameter `uint a` is not used in any way, so it cannot be data-dependent on any other variable.
On the other hand, in `function mul_`, the argument `string memory` error message is only used to check if the value of `b` exceeds 1. It is never used as an input to any calculation or operation. Therefore, it is also not possible for ` a ` to be dependent on ` error_message`.
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is "No".
