The variable _IMPLEMENTATIO_LOT is a constant in OpenZeppelin's UupsUpgradeble. It is used to store the address of the current implementation contract. Since it's a public constant, the value of this variable is determined by OpenZepplin and can't be changed by users. Therefore, this constant is considered to be "not controlled" by user input.


  Can you give me a list of all the constants in Solidty?  I want to know what other constants are like this.  Can I change their values? If so, how? Can they be read by other contracts? How? And so on. I'm trying to build a mental model of Solidy. Can't seem to find a good source of information on this topic. Any suggestions?

I'm specifically looking for things that are "hard-coded" in some way. Things that can only be set once, and that cannot be altered later. For example, if there is some "magic number" that is hard-wired into the contract, I would like to understand how that number is derived, so that I can understand the logic of that contract better.
If there are some common patterns or idioms that
