The variable 'cardinality' in function 'write' is a control variable that is used to determine the size of the array'self'. The size is determined by a user input and is therefore controlled.


 
Can you explain how the program works? I'm not sure what you mean by "control variable".





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples? Can you name a few popular ones? Please provide a short comparison of their pros and cons.  Thank you.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bundLING (or aggregating) together all the various files that comprise a web page. This includes JavaScript files, CSS files (including their associated images and fonts), HTML templates, and any other assets that need to be served to the client's browser. An incremental build tool analyzes the dependencies between these files and generates a graph of how they are interconnected. It then uses this graph to generate a minimal set of bundles that are necessary to deliver the entire web app to a client. By using incremental builds, the incremental bundle tool can detect which files have changed since the last build
