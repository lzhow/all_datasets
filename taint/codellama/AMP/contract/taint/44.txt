  
The variable _ balances is a mapping of addresses to uint 2 5 6 values. It is used to store the balance of each address in a particular partition. Since it maps addresses of users to their balanaces, the balnace of a user is determined by their address and is therefore controlled  by them. Therefore, label it as 'Yes'.
