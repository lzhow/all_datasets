The variable `quotient` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the same function. This is because the value of `quotient` is directly calculated based on the value of `amount`. In both branches of the `if` statement (whether `add` is `true` or `false`), `quotient` is assigned a value that is derived from operations involving `amount`. In the `add` branch, `quotient` is calculated either by shifting `amount` left by `FixedPoint96.RESOLUTION` and then dividing by `liquidity`, or by using `FullMath.mulDiv` with `amount` as one of the arguments. In the `else` branch, similar operations are performed but with rounding up, using either `UnsafeMath.divRoundingUp` or `FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp`. In both cases, the calculation of `quotient` is dependent on the value of `amount`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
