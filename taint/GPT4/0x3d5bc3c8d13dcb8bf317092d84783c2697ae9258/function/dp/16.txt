Reason: The variable `cTokenBalance` in the function `getAccountSnapshot` is assigned the value from `accountTokens[account]`, which is a mapping that presumably holds the token balance for each account. This variable is independent of the `borrowInternal` function and is not affected by any of the operations or state changes that occur within `borrowInternal`. The variable `error` in `borrowInternal` is the result of the `accrueInterest` function and is used to handle errors within the `borrowInternal` function. There is no direct or indirect connection shown in the provided code snippet between `cTokenBalance` and `error`, hence there is no data dependency relationship between them.
