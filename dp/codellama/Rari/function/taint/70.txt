  
The variable error message in function `div_` is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the `require` function in `mul_`, `add_ `, `sub_`. `safe2_2`, and ` safe_3_1` functions are used to check for overflow and under-flow conditions. These functions take a string as an argument, which is used as the error messsage. However, the string is hardcoded and not user-controlled. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the message is user controlled or not.
