The variable `amountInWithFee` is directly calculated from the variable `amountIn` within the same function `getAmountOut`. The line `uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * 997;` shows that `amountInWithFee` is dependent on the value of `amountIn` because it is derived by multiplying `amountIn` by 997. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `amountIn` and `amountInWithFee`.
