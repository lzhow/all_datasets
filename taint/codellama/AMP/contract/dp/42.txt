  
No, the state variable _indexTotalpartions is not dependent on variable partition in function addPartionToTotalsPartions.

The function adds a partition to the total partitions array, and the index of the partition is calculated using the length of total partition array before the addition. Therefore, even if the value of partition changes, it will not affect the calculation of indexTotalpartition.
