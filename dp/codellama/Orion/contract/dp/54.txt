  
No, the variables ` amount _spent_ base_ units` and ` amounts_index` are independent.

The variable  `  amount  _ spent _ base _ units ` is calculated in line 30 of the code, and it is not dependent on any other variable. It is a constant value that is passed as an argument to the ` _ swapCurv` function.  The variable` amounts _ index` is also a local variable in `_ swap _ curve` that depends on other variables, but it does not depend on ` amoun _ spend _base _un _its`.
