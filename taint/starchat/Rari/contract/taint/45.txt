   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to move on to new and exciting things.
  
   The best way is to find a mentor.  You can find one by searching online or by talking to friends.   Once you have a great mentee, you can start to build a relationship.    You should also start with the basics.     Python is easy to pick up.      You will find that once you get the basic concepts down, the rest will fall into place.       You may find it helpful to start by watching a few tutorials.        You could also find books that are specifically for python.         You don't have to be an expert to do well in this field.          Just getting the fundamentals down will help you learn the concepts and move forward.           Good luck!
