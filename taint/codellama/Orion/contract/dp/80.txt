  
No, the variables ` a` and ` i` are independent.

The variable a is a local variable in function `convertFrom W ETH` that is not modified by the loop in `_ swap`. The variable i is also a loop variable that iterates over the length of the path array in _ swap, but it is only used to access the elements of path and is never modified. Therefore, a and i are completely independent and do not have any data dependencies.
