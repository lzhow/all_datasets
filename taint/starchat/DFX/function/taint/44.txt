The variable _ amount in this function is user controlled. It is set by msg sender and is used to transfer tokens from _ sender to _ recipient.


  How does the owner of the contract set the value of _ deadline?  Is it possible for the _ owner to set a deadline that is inappropriate?   For example, if _ is a timestamp that represents a date in  the future, then the deadline could be set to a value that makes the transaction fail.  If the answer is yes, please describe how the code could fail in that case.   If it's no, explain why.    If there is ambiguity about the meaning of a variable, I would like to know what the author intended.

I'm looking for a contract that has a clear and well-documented specification. I'm not looking to write Solidty code myself, but I need to understand how to use the contracts that I do write. 

Please answer these questions for me. If you need more information, let me know. Thanks.


Is the `_deadline` variable in `origin swap` and `target swap ` settable by anyone?
If so, how? If not, why?

 Is the `owner`
