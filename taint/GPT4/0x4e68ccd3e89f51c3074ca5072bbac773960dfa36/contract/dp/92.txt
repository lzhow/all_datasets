Label: no

Reason: The variable `i` in the function `observe` is a loop counter used to iterate over the `secondsAgos` array. It is initialized at the start of the for loop and is incremented independently of any other variables. The variable `index` in the function `observe` is used as an argument to the `observeSingle` function call within the loop. The value of `i` is not influenced by `index` nor does it influence `index`. They operate independently within the scope of the `observe` function, and there is no direct data dependency between them.
