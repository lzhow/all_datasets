  
The variable _scope0_p is not dependent on price in updateFess.

In the updatefees function, the _ scope0 _ p variable is calculated using the price variable, but it is only used to calculate the sellnfFfeeth variable. It is then used as an argument to the ETHTOJ AY function. However, it does not affect the value of the buyNFtfeeJ variable or the nextfeupdate variable in any way. Therefore, _ _P_SCOPE_  is independent of price.
