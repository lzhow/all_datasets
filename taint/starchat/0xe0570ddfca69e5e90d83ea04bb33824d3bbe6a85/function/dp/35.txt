   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
c = list(a)
print(c)


what does list do? what is special about the syntax [] when creating a list? and what does the code a = b do.
I know these are very basic questions, and I apologize if they seem elementary. However, I feel that a little bit of explanation would go a long way in helping me learn. Thank you for your time. If you need any more information, please ask.  I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day!
