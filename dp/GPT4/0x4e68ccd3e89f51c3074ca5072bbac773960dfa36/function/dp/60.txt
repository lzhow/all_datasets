Label: no

Reason: The variable `_feeGrowthGlobal1X128` in the function `_updatePosition` is a local copy of the state variable `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` and is used within the `_updatePosition` function to calculate fee growth inside a specific range and update the position. On the other hand, the variable `amount0Requested` in the function `collect` is an input parameter that specifies the amount of token0 that the caller wants to collect from their position. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `_feeGrowthGlobal1X128` and `amount0Requested` within the given code. `_feeGrowthGlobal1X128` is used for calculations related to fee growth, while `amount0Requested` is used to determine how much of the owed token0 should be transferred to the recipient. They operate independently within their respective functions and do not influence each other's values.
