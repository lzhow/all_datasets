Yes

The variable `senderImplementation` in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` is not directly data dependent on the variable `fromPartitionPrefix` within the same function. The `senderImplementation` variable is assigned a value based on the result of the `interfaceAddr` function call, which takes `_from` and `AMP_TOKENS_SENDER` as arguments. The `fromPartitionPrefix` variable, on the other hand, is derived from the `_fromPartition` argument using the `_getPartitionPrefix` function from the `PartitionUtils` library.

However, there is no direct data flow or computation in `_callPreTransferHooks` that would establish a data dependency relationship between `senderImplementation` and `fromPartitionPrefix`. Each variable is computed independently from different sources and for different purposes within the function.
