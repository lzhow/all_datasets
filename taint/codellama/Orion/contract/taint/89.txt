  
No, the ` new Allowance ` variable in function ` safe Increased Allowances ` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created and used within the scope of the method.

The `safeIncrementAllowances` function takes three parameters: `token`, `spender`, and `value`. The ` value ` parameter is passed in by a user, but the other two parameters are not. Therefore, ` spendee ` and the return value of ` token . allowances (address (this) , spendre) ` are NOT user-controlled.
