In the given code, the `_msgdata()` function returns the `msg.Data` variable, which is a `bytes` type. This variable is defined in Solidiy as a reference to the data sent with the message that called the contract. It is set by Soliidy and cannot be controlled directly by a user, so it cannot have a label of 'Yes'.
