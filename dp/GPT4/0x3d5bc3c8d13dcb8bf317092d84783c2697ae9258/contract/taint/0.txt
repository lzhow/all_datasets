Label: yes

Reason: The variable `redeemTokens` in the function `redeemVerify` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is external and does not have any restrictions on who can call it (such as `onlyOwner` or a similar modifier), any user can call this function and provide a value for `redeemTokens`. Therefore, the value of `redeemTokens` is controlled by the user who calls the function.
