Reason: The variable `srcTokensNew` in the function `transferTokens` is calculated based on the current balance of the `src` address (`accountTokens[src]`) and the `tokens` amount to be transferred. It is not directly or indirectly influenced by the `exchangeRate` variable in the function `exchangeRateStoredInternal`. The `exchangeRate` variable is computed within `exchangeRateStoredInternal` based on different state variables (`totalCash`, `totalBorrows`, `totalReserves`, and `_totalSupply`) and is used to determine the exchange rate of the contract's tokens. There is no code in `transferTokens` that references `exchangeRate` or any of the variables that are used to compute it. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `srcTokensNew` and `exchangeRate`.
