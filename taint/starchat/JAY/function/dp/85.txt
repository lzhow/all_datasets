   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and not having any real understanding of the language. I have heard that the best way is to just start coding and see where it takes you. Is that really the case? Or is there a better way? I heard about the "Learn X in Y minutes" approach, but I don't know which language that would be and how good the results would actually be.
