Reason: The variable `amount1` in the `mint` function is calculated using the local variables `balance1` and `_reserve1`, which are derived from the contract's state and the `IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this))` call. The variable `_token1` in the `swap` function is a local variable that holds the address of `token1` and is used to perform token transfers and balance checks within the scope of the `swap` function. There is no direct data flow or dependency between `amount1` in `mint` and `_token1` in `swap` because they operate in different function scopes and are not influenced by each other's values or state changes. The `amount1` is not computed based on `_token1`, nor is `_token1` used to derive `amount1`. They are related only by the fact that they both reference the `token1` contract address, but this does not create a data dependency between the specific variables in question.
