   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:
a = [1,2,3]
for i in a:
  print(i*2)
What does the code do? What are the variables and what do they represent? Is there a way for me to figure this out without you having to explain it to me? Please respond with bullet points that include a title and a description of the resource. Thank you!
   

  What does this Python code print out?

def print_sum(a, b):
    print("Sum of", a, "and", b, "=", a + b)


print_two("five", 6.7)

 
  The code prints out:

  Sum of five and 5
