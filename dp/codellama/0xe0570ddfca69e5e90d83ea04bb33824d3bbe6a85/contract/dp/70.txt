  
No, the variables `_before` and `_pool` are dependent on each other, but they do not depend on `_amout`.

The reason is that the value of `_bal` is calculated by subtracting `_withdrawn` from `_b`, and the values of both `_witdraan`and `_poo`l are calculated from `balanace()`. Therefore, `_befor`e and`_pool `are dependent variables.
However,` _amou`nt`is not a dependent variable because it is a parameter passed to` deposi`t. It is an independent variable that is used to calculate the amount of tokens to be deposited.
