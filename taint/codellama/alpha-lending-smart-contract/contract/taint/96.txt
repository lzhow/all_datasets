  
No, the `_ NOT_ ENTERED ` variable in function `nonReenterant` is labeled as 'No' because it does not depend on user input. It is a constant value that is set to  `1` in this contract.

The ` nonreentrantly` modifer is used to prevent reentrance attacks in Solidiy contracts. This modier checks if `_status` variable is equal to `_ENTRED` and if it's not, then it sets `_ status` to ` _ ENTRED`. This is done to ensure that the contract is only executed once.
