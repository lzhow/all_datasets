Label: no

Reason: The contract state `transferAllowances` is not present in the provided Solidity code. Therefore, it cannot have a data dependency relationship with the variable `allowResign` or any other variable in the `_prepare` function or elsewhere in the contract. Since `transferAllowances` is not defined or used in the given code snippet, there is no data dependency to analyze between `transferAllowances` and `allowResign`.
