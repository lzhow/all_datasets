Reason: The variable `rootKLast` in the function `_mintFee` is calculated based on the `kLast` state variable, which represents the product of the reserves at the last time liquidity was minted or burned:

```solidity
uint rootKLast = Math.sqrt(_kLast);
```

The variable `balance0` in the function `swap` represents the balance of `token0` after a swap operation has occurred:

```solidity
balance0 = IERC20(_token0).balanceOf(address(this));
```

The `balance0` variable is used to calculate the new reserves after a swap has taken place, and it may affect the `reserve0` state variable if `_update` is called. However, `balance0` does not directly affect `kLast` or `rootKLast`. The `kLast` variable is only updated in the `mint` and `burn` functions, and it is not directly dependent on the `balance0` variable from the `swap` function.

Therefore, `rootKLast` is not data dependent on `balance0` from the `swap` function, as there is no direct or indirect relationship that updates `kLast` based on the `balance0` within the `swap` function. The update of `kLast` is dependent on the reserves at the time of minting or burning liquidity, not on the balances during a swap.
