  
No, the variables ` min Ticket` and ` lower` are independent.

The variable min tick is calculated based on tick spacing and the tick lower, which are both independent variables.  The variable lower is a struct member of the TICk.info struct, and it is not directly related to the min ticket variable. Therefore, min ticke is independent of lower and does not depend on it.
