Yes, ` amountseizerror` is data-dependent on ` repyborrowerror`.

The reason is that the `seizeresult` variable is used in both branches of the conditional statement, and the value of ` seizer esult ` depends on whether `repyBorrowerror ` is equal to `Error. NO_ ERROR` or not.
In the case where ` repPyBorrow error ` equals ` Error.NO ERROR`, the statement `require( ctokenCollatera. balanceOf( borrowera ) >=seiZeTokens," LIQ UIDATE SEIZE TOO MUCH");` will be executed, which will cause the program to throw an exception if the condition is not met. In this case, the exception will not be caught and will lead to the termination of execution of this function. Therefore, it can be seen that `AmountSeizError ` will also be equal `NOERROR`. However, in case `RepyBorro werror'does not equal` Error. NOERROR`, then the else branch will execute, where the assignment `uint seiZetokens =comptrollerr. liquidaterecalculateseizedtokens( address (this),address ( c tokenCollat
