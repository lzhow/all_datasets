The variable 'reserverFacorMantiissa' is a local variable in function '_becomImplemenation' which is called by '_setImplmentationInternal' function. It is initialized with the value of the 'data' parameter, which comes from the caller of '_resigImplementaion' method. Therefore, the initial value is set by a user, but it cannot be changed by any user-controlled input after that.
