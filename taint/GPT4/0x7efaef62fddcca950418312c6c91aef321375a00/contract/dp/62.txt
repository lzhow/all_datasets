Reason: The contract state `name` is a constant string defined in the `PancakeERC20` contract and represents the name of the token. It is initialized as 'Pancake LPs' and cannot be changed. The variable `feeOn` is a local boolean variable within the `mint` function of the `PancakePair` contract, which is used to determine if the protocol fee should be charged during the minting process. The value of `feeOn` depends on whether the `feeTo` address is set in the `IPancakeFactory` contract.

Since `name` is a constant and does not change based on any operations or state changes within the contract, and `feeOn` is a local variable whose value is determined independently of `name`, there is no data dependency relationship between `name` and `feeOn`. The value of `name` remains the same regardless of the value or state of `feeOn`.
