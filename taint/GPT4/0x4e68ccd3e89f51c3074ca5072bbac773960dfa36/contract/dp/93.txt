The variable `beforeOrAt` in the function `observeSingle` is data dependent on the variable `self` in the same function. This is because `beforeOrAt` is assigned a value that is directly retrieved from the `self` array. Specifically, `beforeOrAt` is assigned the result of the `getSurroundingObservations` function, which performs a binary search on the `self` array to find observations surrounding a specific target time. The `self` array holds the `Observation` structs, and the `getSurroundingObservations` function accesses elements within this array to determine the correct `Observation` to assign to `beforeOrAt`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `beforeOrAt` and `self`.
