Label: yes

Reason: The variable `compoundedLiquidityBalance` in the function `getUserPoolData` is assigned the return value of the function `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance(_user, _token)`, which indicates that its value is dependent on the input parameter `_token`. Although the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount` is not directly called within `getUserPoolData`, the dependency of `compoundedLiquidityBalance` on `_token` is established through the function call to `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance`. Since `_token` is an input parameter for both `getUserCompoundedLiquidityBalance` and `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount`, and the value of `compoundedLiquidityBalance` is derived from a function that uses `_token`, there is a data dependency relationship between `compoundedLiquidityBalance` and `_token`.
