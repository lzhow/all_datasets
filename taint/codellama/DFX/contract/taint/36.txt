In the given code, the `viewLiuqidty` function is marked as `external` and `returns` a tuple of two values: `uint total`and `individual_`. The `return` statement is executed by Soliidy compiler and the values are returned to the caller.
Therefore, ` total _` is a local variable in ` viewLiquidity`function and it's not user-controlled.
