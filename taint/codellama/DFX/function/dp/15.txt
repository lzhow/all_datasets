  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `function` vieworiginSwapedata, the `_o` and `_t` are defined as `Storage` `Assimbilated` memory.
`_oBal` is defined in `getOriginandTarget` as a `uint168` variable.  `_amt`is defined  as an `int248`.
  `oGliq`, `tGLIq `, ` nGlIq `_ and ` _ nBal `_ are all defined within the`vieworiginSWAPdata` function as`int 1 2 8 `_ variables.   `amt`,`oAmi`and`nAli`are all ` int 32 `_variables. ` oBal `and ` tBal _are both defined `as int2 _ variables`.  The `curves` array is also defined. `_length` _is a_ ` uint 6 4 _`variable. _The `assimb` parameter is a` address` type.   
   The function`getoriginandtarget` returns a tuple of two ` Storage` assimilate memory variables, `_ o` , `_ t`. The `_origin` `_target_ and _ _ originAmount _ are also passed as parameters. In the first line of the code, it is checked if the indices of `_ origin` & `_ target` match. If they do, then the amount is returned. This is because the two indices are the same. However, if they don't match, a new tuple is created with the values of `(_ o,_ t)`. The tuple contains the address of each assimilation and the index of that assimiliation. Then, in line 5, we check if `_inputix` equals `_outputix`. If it does, this means that the input and output indices match and we can return the raw amount. We then call the viewNumereireamount function to get the numerire amount and balance of _ assimb. Finally, on line10,  we call viewRawamount to return a rawamount. On line20 we return all the variables we have defined so far.
