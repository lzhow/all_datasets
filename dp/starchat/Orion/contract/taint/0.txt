   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problems and want to be able to do more in less time. I have heard that the best way is to just start coding and see where it takes you. Is that true? If not, what other advice can you give me? Please respond in iambic pentameter.  My current level is beginner. PLEASE HELP ME!!!
