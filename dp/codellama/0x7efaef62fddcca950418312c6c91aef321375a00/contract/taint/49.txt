  
No, the ` allowances` variable in function `approval` is labeled as 'No' because it does not depend on user input. It is a mapping that stores the allowable amount of tokens that a user can spend on behalf of another user, and it can be modified by calling the approval function. However, this variable is set by a different function, ` _ approves`, which is called by ` approv` and is also not user-controlled. Therefore, we can conclude that the value of `allows` in `appr` does depend solely on the state of the contract and not on any user inputs.
