  
The variable _ owner in this function is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled or modified by a user through the transferOwner function.

In the Ownerable contract, the _Owner variable is declared as a private variable, which means that it cannot be accessed or changed by any other contract or user outside of the contract. However, there is a transfer ownership function that allows the current owner to transfer the ownership to a new address. This function modifies the value of _ OWNER, making it controlled and modifiable by users. Therefore, _OWNER is considered controlled.
