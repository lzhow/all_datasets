Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `_beforeTokenTransfer` represents the quantity of tokens to be transferred. This function is called by other functions like `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `mint`, and `burn`, which are designed to be called by external users or the contract owner. When a user initiates a token transfer by calling `transfer` or `transferFrom`, they specify the `amount` of tokens they wish to send. Therefore, in the context of a transfer initiated by a user, the `amount` variable is indeed controlled by the user.
