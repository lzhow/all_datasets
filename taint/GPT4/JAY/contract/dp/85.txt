No, the variable `roundID` in the function `getLatestPrice` is not data dependent on the variable `timeStamp` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `roundID` is assigned the value of `priceFeed.latestRoundData().roundID`, while the variable `timeStamp` is assigned the value of `priceFeed.latestRoundData().timeStamp`. Both variables are assigned values from the same function call `priceFeed.latestRoundData()`, but they are assigned different properties of the returned struct. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `roundID` and `timeStamp`.
