Reason: In the Solidity contract provided, `_balances` is an implicit state variable that is part of the ERC20 token standard, which tracks the token balance of each address. Although `_balances` is not explicitly mentioned in the `buyERC1155` function, this function is involved in the transfer of ERC1155 tokens in exchange for the contract's ERC20 tokens (named "JAY" in this contract).

The `buyERC1155` function calculates the total amount of ERC1155 tokens being bought by summing up the `amounts` array. This total amount is then used in the `buyNFTs` function to determine how many ERC20 tokens (JAY) should be burned from the sender's balance as a fee for buying NFTs. The `_burn` function, which is a standard part of the ERC20 implementation, will internally adjust the `_balances` mapping to reflect the decrease in the sender's token balance due to the burning of tokens.

Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the `amounts` variable in the `buyERC1155` function and the `_balances` state variable because the `amounts` variable indirectly influences the value of `_balances` when the ERC20 tokens are burned as part of the NFT purchase process.
