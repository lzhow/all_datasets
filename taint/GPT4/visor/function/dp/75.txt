Reason: The variable `data` in the function `functionCall` and the variable `data` in the function `functionDelegateCall` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. They are not dependent on each other because they are passed as arguments when the functions are called and do not share state or influence each other outside of their function scope. Each function call operates independently, and the `data` in one function does not affect the `data` in the other.
