   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but this is my first time trying to program. Can you recommend a few good resources for me to look at to help me learn the basics? I'd also appreciate it if you could recommend some good first programs to write. Thank you!
   

  What are some of the most popular beginner-friendly languages?

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language. It is often compared to a scripting language, as it was designed for interactive use rather than for writing software that runs continuously.
It offers a wide range of libraries and modules that support many aspects of programming, including:
a) Mathematics
b) System administration
c) Networking
d) GUI creation
e) Database access
f) Data analysis
g) Artificial intelligence
h) Testing and debugging
i) Multithreading
j) Regular expressions
