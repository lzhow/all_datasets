yes

In the Solidity code provided, the variable `target` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the same function. This is because both variables are used together in the call to the low-level `call` function:

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{ value: value }(data);
```

Here, `target` specifies the address to which the call is being made, and `data` contains the payload of the call. The execution of the call and its outcome can be influenced by the combination of `target` and `data`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `target` and `data` within the `functionCallWithValue` function.
