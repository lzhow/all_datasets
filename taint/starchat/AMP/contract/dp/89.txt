The contract has 2 mappings that are dependent on `_partition`: `_balanceOf` and `_allowed`.

`_indexOfPartition` is not used in any function, so it is irrelevant to the question.
`totalPartitionCount` does not affect the behavior of the program, and is therefore not considered a state variable.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that `_totalSupplies` should be considered as a contract variable, not `_balances`.
 
  No problem! I understand that you may have made an error in your analysis. However, it's important to note that the analysis you provided is incomplete and does contain some errors. For example, the `_transfer` function does have an `if` statement that checks if `_value` equals  `0`. However this check is unnecessary because Solidty automatically throws an exception if you try to transfer a value of  zero. Therefore, this `require` check can be removed without affecting the functionality of your contract. Additionally, you should also check the `transfer`, `approve`, and `increaseAllowances` functions to ensure that they have the same issue. Finally, please note the use of `msg` in Soliditiy is deprecated and
