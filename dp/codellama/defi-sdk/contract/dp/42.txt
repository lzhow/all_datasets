  
No, the variables ` amount` and ` amounts` are independent.

The variable amount is defined in `depostETh` function and is not used in any other function. On the other hand, ` getamountsin` is a function that returns an array of amounts, and the amount of the array is determined by the length of pairs and directions arrays. Therefore, it is independent of ` depositeTh`.
