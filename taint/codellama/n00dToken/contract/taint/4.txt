  
The variable 'defaultOperator' in function contructor is labeled as 'Yes' because it takes an array of addresses as an argument, which can be controlled or manipulated by a user during the deployment of the contract.

In Solidiy, the constructor function of a contract is called when the contruct is deployed. During this process, a constructor can take arguments that are passed to it. These arguments can come from a variety of sources, including the deployer of contract, other contracts, or even the blockchain itself. In this case, 'defualtOpertors' is an address array that is passed as a parameter to contrustor. This means that the address of default operators can change during deployment, and the value of this variable can vary depending on the context in which the smart contract was deployed, making it controlled  by user .
