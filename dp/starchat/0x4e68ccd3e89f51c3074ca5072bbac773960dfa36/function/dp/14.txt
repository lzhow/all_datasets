   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems and want to move on to more complex projects. I have heard that the best way is to just start writing code, and over time, just keep practicing. Is that a bad strategy? Should I be using a specific IDE or text editor? Or is there some other approach I should be taking? Please give me some tips and recommendations. Thank you.  I also heard about repl.it, can you recommend a website I can use to practice? Thankyou. Also, if you could recommend some beginner friendly projects I could do with python that would be really helpful. Again, thank you for your help.   I know this is probably too much information, but I just want you to be as helpful as possible. If you need me to clarify or expand on any of the responses, please let me know. Any additional information you can provide would also be greatly appreciated.   
    Learning to program in Python can be a challenging and rewarding experience
