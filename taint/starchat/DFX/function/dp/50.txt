The answer is no.

`_threshold` is a local variable that is only used in an if-else statement, and it is not used after the if statement. Therefore, it does not affect the value of ` fee_` and does therefore not have any data dependence on it.


  Can you explain why it's not a problem
 
  The reason why the data dependencies are unknown is that the code snippet is incomplete. It is missing the implementation of the functions `ONE`, `MAX`, and `mul`. Without these functions, the program is unable to determine the values of these variables, which would affect their data-dependence. Additionally, some of those variables may be used outside of their intended scope, leading to incorrect results. For example, ` _balance` may not be the same as `balance`, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Overall, without the full implementation, there is insufficient information to accurately determine data flow. 

It is important to note that dataflow analysis is an important step in many programming languages, including Solidty, as it helps developers understand how data is passed between functions and contracts. However, in this case, since the complete code was not provided, data analysis was unable complete,
