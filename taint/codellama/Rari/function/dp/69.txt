  
No, the variables ` allowed` and ` totalFeuseFeeNew ` are independent.

The variable  `allow` is defined in function `borrrowFres` as the result of the `comptroller` function call. This function is not dependent on `withDrawFusFeessFress` or `totalfusefeesnew`.
On the other hand, ` totalfusfeeNew is` defined as a local variable in ` withdrawFuFeFeFreesFess` . This variable is only used within the scope of this function and is therefore not accessible to other functions. Therefore, there is no data dependence between ` allow`and ` totafusfessnew`
