  
No, the `_ total Supply ` variable in this function does not appear to be controlled directly by a user input. It is set to a constant value of 60 seconds, which is a fixed amount of time that the contract will wait before executing the `upgradeStrategy` function. This means that it cannot be changed by any user inputs, and is therefore not considered controlled.

The `_proposer` variable is also not directly controlled, as it only appears to store the address of the account that proposed the strategy upgrade, but does so in a way that is transparent and cannot easily be manipulated by users. Therefore, both variables are not labeled as controlled and are instead labled as 'No'.
