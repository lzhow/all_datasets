  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getOriginSWapdata` function, the `_amt` variable is calculated by subtracting the input amount from the balance of the origin assimilater. This means that the value of `_oBal` is dependent on `_amount`.
Similarly, in `ViewOrigin Swappedata`, the amount is subtracted from `_bal` to calculate `_A_mt`. This also means the the values of `nBal_` are dependent of`_amount`
Therefore, `_NGL_i_q`, which is a sum of all the balances of assimalators, is also dependent  on` _amount`, and therefore, it is data-dependent on ` _OriginAmount`.
