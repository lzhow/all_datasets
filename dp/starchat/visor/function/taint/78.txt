The variable b in function `sub` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of b is derived from user-controlled input a. Therefore, b can be considered to be controlled indirectly by a and therefore be classified as user controlled.


  Can you explain how the program analyzes the code to determine if a variable or state of a contract is user or not? How does it determine that? Please provide a step-by-step explanation.

I understand that Solidty is a high-level language, but I don't understand how it can analyze code without executing it. Can't it just look at the text of the contract and make assumptions about what the programmer intended?
Can you please explain in detail how you analyze Soliditiy code? I would like to know how your program works, so that I can understand if it would be a good fit for my purposes. I am specifically looking for a tool that can help me identify user and non-user input in Solidities smart contracts. If you could provide me with a detailed explanation of how to use your tool, that would also be great. 

Thank you for your help. Your time is appreciated.
