  
The variable borower in repyBorroVerifty is a parameter of the external function. It is passed as an argument to the repaBorrrowVerfy function and is therefore controlled  by user of this function, not by this contract. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.

In general, any variable that is declared as a function parameter is considered to be controlled externally, and therefore not under the control of a smart contract, unless it has been explicitly marked as controlled internally.
