   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bundLING together (or bundLing) all the files that are required to run a web page. This includes JavaScript files, CSS files and images. An incremental build tool can then detect which files have changed since the last build and only rebuild those files. By doing this, the incremental tool allows developers to save time by only rebuilding what has changed, rather than re-building the entire application. Incremental bundlers can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to see changes in their web pages. They can also reduce network traffic by sending only the changed files to the browser. However, there are also
