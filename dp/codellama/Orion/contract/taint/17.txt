  
The variable 'reservesInput' in function '_swap' is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the value of 'amountInput', which is used to calculate 'reverveInput,' is passed as an argument to the 'OrinMultiPollLibrary' function 'getAmoutOut' or 'GetAmountin'. The value is then used in a calculation to determine the amount of tokens to be transferred.
However, the exact value passed to ' getAmountout'/'getamountin' cannot be determined from the code provided. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the input is user-controlled or not.
