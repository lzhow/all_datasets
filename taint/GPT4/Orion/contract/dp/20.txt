No, the variable `pair` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `curFactory`. 

Explanation: The variable `pair` is assigned the value returned by the function `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.pairFor(curFactory, input, output)`. The value of `curFactory` is passed as an argument to the function, but the value of `pair` does not depend on the value of `curFactory` within the function `_swap`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
