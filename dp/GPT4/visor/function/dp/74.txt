Label: no

Reason: In the provided Solidity contract code, the variable `decimals` is an argument to the constructor function and is used to set up the decimal places for the ERC20 token by calling `_setupDecimals(decimals);`. The variable `symbol` is also an argument to the constructor function and is used to set the symbol for the ERC20 token by passing it to the ERC20 base contract constructor `ERC20(name, symbol);`. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `decimals` and `symbol` within the constructor function; they are used independently to initialize different aspects of the token. Therefore, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
