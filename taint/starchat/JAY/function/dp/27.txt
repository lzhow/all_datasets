The function updateFee() is called by the sell() function.

In the updateFe()e() call, the value of the `price` variable is assigned to the `_price_scoep_1` local variable. 

Then, in a conditional statement, if the statement `timeStamp>nextFeeUpdat`e is true, then the program will execute the next statement. In this case, it is a require statement that checks if `owner()=msg`sender is equal to `msg`.
If the condition is met, `sellNf`tFee`eth_sc`ope_2` is set to a new value. This value is calculated by dividing the USD price of Jaycoin (1*1e12 wei) by `_pric` e_scop_ 0.
 
  Can you explain how the data dependencies are calculated?


  Sure! Data dependencies in code are determined through static analysis of variables and functions. When analyzing a function, a program looks at all the variables that are used within the code, and determines if any of them are dependent on other variables. If a variable depends on another variable, we say that the first variable has a
