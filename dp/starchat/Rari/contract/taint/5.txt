    An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bundl ing together all the assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, and HTML files) into a single file that can be served to users. This helps reduce the number of requests made to servers when a user accesses a web page, which can significantly improve the page load time.

    The key features of an incremental bundle tool include:

    Bundling: The tool analyzes the dependencies between different assets and groups them into bundles.
    Code splitting: Large bundles can cause performance issues on slower networks, so the tool can split bundles into smaller chunks to reduce their size. 
    Asset optimization: Tools like image min
