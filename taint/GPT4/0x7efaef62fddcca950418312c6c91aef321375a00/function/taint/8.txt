Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `balance1` in the function `_update` is assigned the value of the balance of `token1` that the contract holds (`uint balance1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));`). Since `token1` is an ERC20 token, its balance can be influenced by user actions. Users can send `token1` to the contract address, increasing the balance, or the contract may transfer `token1` to another address based on some function calls that users can initiate, thus decreasing the balance. Therefore, the value of `balance1` is indirectly controlled by user actions.
