The ` swap` function is a public function that allows users to swap tokens in a liquididy pool. It takes in two parameters: `uint` `  amount ` and `address` to.
 The ` uint` amount is calculated based on the current reserves of the liquidty pool and the total supply of tokens. This means that the amount of token that will be swapped is determined by  the smart contract and is therefore not under the control of a user who calls the swap function.
