The variable _ assim in this function is unknown. It is a contract address that is passed as an argument to the view function. However, the code does not appear to be accessing the contract at that address, so it cannot be determined whether or not the address is user-controlled.


  Can you explain how I can determine if an address in Solidty is under my control? I want to write a program that can do that for me. I know how to do it for other languages, but I don't know if Solidit has something similar. Can I use the blockchain to help me do this? If so, how? Can't I just look at the source code? How do I do if I'm using a library? Please explain in detail. Thank you.

I want you to explain this in a way that a complete beginner could understand. Use examples if necessary. If you need help with any of the steps, please ask. Also, if you could provide a list of good first issues for someone who is just starting to learn about Solidities, that would be great. Thanks. 

Please also provide me with a short list with the most important Solidites concepts. This will help people understand what to focus on
