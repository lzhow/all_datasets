Reason: The variable `_status` in the `ReentrancyGuard` contract is a private state variable that is used to prevent reentrant calls to certain functions. It is modified only within the `nonReentrant` modifier, which changes its value before and after the execution of the function it is applied to. Since the variable is private and not exposed to any public functions that allow for external modification, and it is only modified internally by the contract's logic to prevent reentrancy, it is not controlled by the user.
