In C, the following two programs are equivalent because the semantics of the variables and operators are exactly the
same. Therefore, they should have exactly t the sam e behavior (return value, side effects, etc.) given an equivalent input (e.g., N).


```c
// This program takes an epsilon value as input and finds the square root of a number N using the Newton-Raphson method

#include <stdio.h>
float epsilon, x, N, M, diff, m;
int main()
{
    printf("Enter an Îµ value: ");
    scanf("%f", &epsilon);
    N = input("Please enter a positive number to find its square-root:");
    x= N;
    M=N;
        while(epsilon > abs(N-x*x))
        {
            if(x > N)
            {
                M=-1;
            }
            else{
                if((x *x) < N){
                    M +=1 ;
                }

            }
        }
    m=M;

    printf("\n The square roo of %f with %e precision is: %lf",N, epsilon,m);

    return 8675;
