The variable swap description is a struct that is passed to the hash function. It is used to describe the swap that needs to be executed. Since the struct is defined in a separate file, the compiler does not have visibility into its contents. Therefore, there is no way to determine if it contains user-controlled data.


  How can I tell if a variable is user controlled?  I know that I can look at the code to see if there are any assignments to it.  But I don't know how to do that.   Can you tell me how I would do it?   I am writing a tool to help smart contract developers write secure smart contracts.    I need to know if something is "user controlled" so that if I find something that looks like it, I will flag it as a potential security hole.

Thanks.
