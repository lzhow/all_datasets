In the given code, the `_Rollback_Slot` variable is defined as a constant, and its value is calculated using the `kecckak_265` function. This function is a cryptographic hash function that takes a string as input and returns a 20-byte hash value.
Since the value of `_rollbackSlo` is derived from a hash of a fixed string, its security is determined by that of the hash algorithm used. In this case, `Keccack_ 512`is used, which is considered to be secure. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the  `_ rollback slot` value can be controlled or not by a user, as it depends on the security of `Kecckack  _521` algorithm.
