  
The label is 'No'.

In the `getAccountSnapShot` function, the local variable  ` ctokenBalances` is assigned the value of the mapping `accountTokes[address]`, which is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in ` liquidatBorroweFres` the parameter `borrowBalanc`e is calculated using the internal function  borrowBallanceStoreInternal, which depends on `address (this)` and ` address (ctokenCollteral)`.
Therefore, `ctoknBalnce` and  the  parameter  borowBalanace are independent of each other.
