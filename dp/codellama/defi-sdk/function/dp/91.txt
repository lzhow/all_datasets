  
No, the variables `input` and `swapDescription` are passed as arguments to the `handleInput` function, which modifies the state of the contract. However, `getAbsolutInputAmout` is called with `absoluteInputAmmount` as an argument, and the return value of `Base.balance()` is assigned to `initalInputBanlance`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between `inut`and `intialInputbalnce`.

The variable`outputBalnaceChange`is assigned the difference between the balance of`outpu.toke`n and`initialOutputBlanace`, which is calculated using`Basebalancel`function. Therefore thereis no direct data dependance between`inputbalancChange and outputbalncChange`.
