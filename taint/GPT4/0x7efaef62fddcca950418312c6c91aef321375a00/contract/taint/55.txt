Label: no

Reason: The variable `_reserve1` in the function `_mintFee` is a private variable that represents the reserve of token1 in the liquidity pool. It is not directly set by user input but is updated by the contract's functions such as `_update`, which adjusts the reserves based on the liquidity provided or removed from the pool. The updates to `_reserve1` are a result of the contract's internal logic and the state of the contract's balance, not direct user control. Users can influence the reserve indirectly by interacting with the contract's functions like `mint`, `burn`, `swap`, etc., but they do not have direct control over the variable itself.
