Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `factoryType` in the function `getAmountInUniversal` is not directly dependent on the variable `factory` in the function `getAmountsOut`. The two variables are passed as separate arguments to their respective functions and there is no direct assignment or usage of one variable in the other function. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a data dependency relationship between these two variables based on the given code snippet.
