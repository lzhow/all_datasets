No, the variable `erc721Ids` in the function `buyNFTs` is not data dependent on the variable `answeredInRound` in the function `getLatestPrice`. 

The reason is that there is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `answeredInRound` in the `buyNFTs` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
