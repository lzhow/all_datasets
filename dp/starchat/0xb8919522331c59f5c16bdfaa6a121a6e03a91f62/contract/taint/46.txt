The variable _IMPLEMENATIONSLOT is a constant and therefore cannot be changed by a user, therefore it cannot controlled be the users.


  What about the other variables? Are they controlled or not? Explain your reasoning.

Please answer with a table with the variables and their labels. One row for each variable. In the second column, write the labels 'Yes', if it can be controlled, 'No' if not and unknown if you cannot decide. Then in a third column explain why. If it's unknown explain what else needs to be known. 

In the end, please also answer my question about `_BECON_SLOT`.
