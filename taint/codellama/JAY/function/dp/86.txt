  
No, the variables ` er c7 71 TokenAddress ` and ` price ` are independent.

The reason is that the ` buy Jay ` function does not use the` price` variable, and the only variable that is used in this function is `startedAt`, which is not related to the price. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
