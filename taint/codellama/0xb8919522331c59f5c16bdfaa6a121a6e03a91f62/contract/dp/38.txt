  
No.

The contract variable _rollBackSLOt is a storage slot, which is an internal variable of the ER1869Upgade contract. It is used to store the address of a new contract implementation.  The variable is set in function `_upgrateTo` and `_setImplmentation`. The function takes an address as an argument and sets the value of `_IMMplementation_SLoT` to that address. Therefore, the data in `_rollBacK_slOT is dependent on `_implementation_sLo_T`.
However, `_DATA` is passed as a parameter to the constructor of `ER1_9_6_7_Upgrde` but it is never used in that function. Hence, it does not affect the state of _`rollbac_k_SlOT`. Therefore the answer is No.
