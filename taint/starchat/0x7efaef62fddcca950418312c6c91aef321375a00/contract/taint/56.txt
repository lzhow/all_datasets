  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiy





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers is any tool that takes a set of files that make up a web application and combines them into a single file that can be served to a user's browser. Incremental bundl[ing] is different from traditional bund[ling] in that it only updates the portions of a bundle that have changed since the last time the bundle was generated. This makes it much faster than a traditional bundle, especially for larger applications.
This is achieved by analyzing the dependencies between the files in a project and determining which portions need to change when a given file changes. These dependencies are then used by bundlin[g] tools to determine which files need rebundling and which
