The variable "data" in function "functionCallWithValu"e is data-dependent on variable data in " function StaticCall". This is because the value of the " data" variable in one function is used as the input to the other function.


  Can you explain this in simpler terms?
 
  Yes, I can explain it in a simpler way.

In the code you provided, the variables "target" and "value" are used in both functions. However, since "call" is a low-level function, it is not possible to determine whether these variables are dependent on each other. Therefore, we cannot determine the data dependence relationship between these two functions, and we must assume that they may be dependent in some way, even though this may not be the case. This means that we can't be sure whether the two code blocks are truly independent or whether they share some common data. In other words, while it may seem that the functions are independent, in reality they might share data that could affect the behavior of both. So, to summarize, data dependencies cannot be determined automatically in this case, so we have to assume they exist.


Does this help clarify the situation? Let me know if
