Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `c` in the function `divCeil` is calculated based on the parameters `a` and `b` that are passed to the function. Since the function is marked as `internal`, it can only be called from within the contract itself or from derived contracts, not directly by an external user. However, without additional context about how this function is used within the contract or how the parameters `a` and `b` are obtained, it is not possible to determine whether the values of `a` and `b` (and therefore `c`) are influenced or controlled by the user. If `a` and `b` are provided by the user in some way (e.g., through a public or external function that calls `divCeil`), then `c` could be indirectly controlled by the user. If `a` and `b` are derived from contract state that the user cannot influence, then `c` would not be controlled by the user. Without this context, the control over `c` is unknown.
