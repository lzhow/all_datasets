The variable curBalnce is a balance of the token in this contract. It is used to keep track of how much of a token is in a contract, and is updated every time a swap is made. However, this variable is only updated when a new swap occurs, so it cannot be directly controlled.


  Can you explain why it's not possible to control it? What are the limitations of static analysis? How can we be sure that the code we are reviewing is free of bugs? Can we trust the tool? Is it possible for the analysis to be wrong? If so, how do we know?

I'm not asking you to write a proof, but I would like to understand the reasons why this is so. I'm particularly interested in how the use of an SAST tool can help us write more secure code.
Can you also explain how static code analysis can be used in practice to find bugs and vulnerabilities in code? Please provide examples and best practices. How do you ensure that these tools are reliable and accurate? Are there any ethical considerations when using these kinds of tools? For example, can the results of these analyses be shared with the development team? Or do they need to remain confidential?
