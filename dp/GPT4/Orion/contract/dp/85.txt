Reason: The variable `_factory` in the constructor is used to initialize the `factories` array with a single element, which is `_factory`. The `getFactoriesLength` function returns the length of the `factories` array. Since the `factories` array is directly dependent on the value of `_factory` provided during the contract's construction (as it determines the initial length of the array), there is a data dependency relationship between `_factory` in the constructor and the `factories` array used in `getFactoriesLength`. Therefore, the length returned by `getFactoriesLength` is dependent on the initial value of `_factory`.
