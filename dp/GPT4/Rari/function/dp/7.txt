Explanation: The variable `mathErr` in the function `borrowAllowed` is not directly dependent on the variable `cTokenBorrowed` in the function `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens`. The variable `mathErr` is dependent on the result of the `addUInt` function, which takes `totalBorrows` and `borrowAmount` as inputs. However, `cTokenBorrowed` is not used as an input for the `addUInt` function. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `mathErr` and `cTokenBorrowed`.
