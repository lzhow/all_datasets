   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and not having any real understanding of how programming works. I have tried making simple programs but I just can't seem to get them to work. If someone could explain it to me like I know how it works that would be great. Also if there are any good coding websites that I could use to help me learn that are free to use that is also great!

  What's the best way for me to start a collection hobby? I'm trying to build a deck of cards and I want to try and get as many different cards as possible. Any suggestions? Thanks!
