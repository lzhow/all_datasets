  
No, the `contract state isCTokenn` is not dependent on `variable oldimplementation`in the `_ setImplemenationInternal` function.

The reason is that the state variable is declared in a different contract, `CTOKEN`, and is accessed through the inheritance relationship between `CEthereDelegate` and `Ctoken`. The `setimplementationInternal()` function is defined in `ceThereDelgate`, which does not have access to the private state variables of `cToken`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
