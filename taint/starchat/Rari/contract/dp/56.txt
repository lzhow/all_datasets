   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning howto code python.  The best way is to find a tutorial online that will teach you the basics of python and how it works.   Once you have the fundamentals down, you can start to build out more complex programs.    You can also find many youtube channels that have tutorials on python programming.     Another good resource is stackoverflow.com.      You should also make sure to install the latest version of Python.       You will also need a code editor.        I would recommend Visual Studio Code.         Once all of this is installed, it is time to get started on your first python program.          Good luck!
