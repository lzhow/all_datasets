The variable "b" in mul_() is a scalar and is therefore not directly controlled or influenced by a user's input. However, the values it operates on are influences by user input and can therefore be considered as being controlled.


  How can I make sure that the value of "a" is always smaller than the maximum value that can be stored in an uint? I want to avoid overflows. How would I do that? Can you give me an example?

Also, how can one make the same guarantees for the "mul" function? Please provide an explanation for both functions.
I want you to explain how to do this in a way that is easy to understand. I don't want any formulas or complex explanations. Just a few sentences that explain what is happening and why it's necessary. If there's anything I should know about Solidty or programming in general, please tell me. But please keep it simple. Thanks!
