Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `tokenB` in the function `pairFor` is not used or referenced in the function `getAmountOutCurve`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `tokenB` and `i`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if the values of `tokenB` and `i` are somehow related through other variables or functions not shown in the provided code snippet.
