The contract variable "collateralsManagers" is not directly accessed in this function, so it is impossible to determine if it has a direct or indirect data dependence relationship with the "toParition" variable. However, it can be inferred indirectly by observing the behavior of the program.

When the "_transferbyPartition" function is called, the value of "fromParititon" and "data" are provided as input parameters. These values can affect the state of other contract variables and ultimately affect whether the collateralManager variable is updated. Therefore, "colateralMangers" may be indirect affected by the values of these two parameters, and this relationship can only be determined through a more thorough analysis of this specific function.


  Can you explain how you determined that the `colaterlsManagers ` variable was not accessed directly?
 
  I analyzed the code to identify all the variables that were used in each function and compared them to the list of variables in that contract. I then looked for any variables used that weren't declared in any of those functions. If a variable wasn't used, I marked it as "unused" in my analysis. In this case, `colelteralManagers`, which
