yes, the `_blocksTimestamplast` variable in `getReservse` is user controlled.

  What is a good way to mitigate this?  How can I make my code safer? I am new to solidity and smart contracts.  I would like to learn best practices and how to write secure smart contract. I have heard that using `view` and `pure` functions can help make the code more secure. What other best practice methods are there? Please provide some examples. Thank you.

I am also wondering if you can explain how the `SafeMath` library works and why it's used. Can you provide an example of how I could implement a similar library myself?
Thank you for your help. This is very important to me. 

Please answer with examples of code for each of the best pratices you mentioned. For example, how would I implement the use of `View` vs `Pure` in my own code? How would the implementation of a `safeMath library` look like? 
 I appreciate your time and help with this. If you could provide me with a list of best practises and examples for implementing them, that would be very helpful. Again, thank you very much for
