The variable `errorMessage` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is passed as an argument to the function `_verifyCallResult`. Inside `_verifyCallResult`, the `errorMessage` is used in a conditional statement that depends on the boolean variable `success`. If `success` is `false`, and the `returndata` length is 0 or the assembly block does not execute a revert, then `errorMessage` is used in the `revert(errorMessage)` statement. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `errorMessage` and `success` because the output or behavior of the `_verifyCallResult` function depends on the value of `success` and could potentially use the value of `errorMessage`.
