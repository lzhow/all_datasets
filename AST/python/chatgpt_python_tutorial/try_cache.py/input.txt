You are a Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  Python code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has three attributes, type, value and children.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        def trycach(x):
    try:
        print(x)
    except NameError:
        print("Variable x is not defined")
    except:
        print("Something else went wrong")
        ```
