The contract function ```withdrawReserver``` is a state mutating function that is marked as ```external``` and ```nonReentrancy```. This means that it can be called by other functions in this contract, but it cannot be re-entered.

It also has a modifier ```updatePool``` which is not defined in Solidiy. It is unclear what this modifier does, and it is likely that this function is related to the ```InterestRateModel``` contract.

Therefore, I cannot determine if the variables ```_owner``` or ```pool``` are dependent on ```token``` in ```this function```


  I'm sorry, you are wrong
