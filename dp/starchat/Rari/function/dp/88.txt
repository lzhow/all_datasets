The contract is not a state machine, so it is impossible to determine if the `underlyings` are dependent on `amout`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "contract state". Could you please rephrase your question?
  
  Sorry for the confusion. I meant to say that the underlying is a contract that is deployed on a blockchain.

  
 
  
  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. Explain the concept of an incremental bundling and how it works.
  3. Provide an example of a popular incrementalbundler for Web applications.

An incremental bundle is any tool or process that takes a graph of dependencies and generates a bundle of assets that can be served to the browser. Incremental bundlers are used in development to enable fast reloading of code changes. They achieve this by only rebuilding parts of the bundle that have changed, rather than regenerating the entire bundle. This can result in much faster reloads and better developer experience. Popular examples of incremental bundles for modern web development include Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel.

1) What are some examples where incremental builds are useful?
