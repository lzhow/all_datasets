  What is a user-controlled variable?  How does this relate to smart contracts?

User-Controlled Variables are variables that are set by a human user and are not automatically updated by software. They are typically used to store user preferences or settings. In the context of smart contract development, user control over variables is essential to ensure that the smart contact operates as intended and does not violate any regulatory requirements.
In the case of the borrow function, a smart-contract user may wish to set a borrowing limit to protect their funds. This limit could be set as a variable that is updated manually by users. If the limit is set too low, users may not be able to borrow enough money to pay off debts. However, if this variable is automatically set, then it could become difficult to enforce the desired borrow limit. For example, in some jurisdictions, regulations may require that borrow limits be enforced through software and not manually set. Therefore, smart contacts must be designed to be flexible and allow for a wide range of user settings and preferences. User-control over smart variables can be achieved through various methods, including
