  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `buynft` function, the parameter `ERc 7 5 6 9 8 4 3  ` is passed to the internal function `_burn`. The `_ burn` method is defined in a parent contract, and it takes two parameters: the address of the account to burn the tokens from and the amount of tokens to be burned.
Since the `_ Burn`method is called with the`msg .sender` address as the first parameter, it means that the balance of `msg` is being burn. This means the value of`erc ​​7`2`1`Ids is dependent on` msg` .
Therefore, `yes` the answer is.
