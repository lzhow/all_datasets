The variable `swapDescription` in the function `execute` is controlled by the user because it is passed as an argument to the function in a transaction call. The user constructs the transaction and can set the fields of `swapDescription` to any value they choose before sending the transaction to the smart contract. Therefore, the state of `swapDescription` is directly influenced by the user's input.
