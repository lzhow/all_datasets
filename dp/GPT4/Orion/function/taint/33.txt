Explanation: The variable `reserve1` in the function `_swap` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of `reserve1` from the `getReserves()` function call, which retrieves the reserves of a pair from the OrionPoolV2Pair contract. The reserves are determined by the liquidity providers and are not directly controlled by the user.
