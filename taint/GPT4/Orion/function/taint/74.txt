Explanation: The variable `_owner` in the function `owner()` is not controlled by the user. It is a private variable that is set in the constructor of the `Ownable` contract and can only be modified by the `renounceOwnership()` and `transferOwnership()` functions, which are restricted to the contract owner. Therefore, the user does not have control over this variable.
