The contract state `_currentSnapshotId` is used to keep track of the current snapshot ID in the `ERC20Snapshot` contract, which is a mechanism for recording the state of balances at particular block numbers. The variable `newOwner` in the function `transferOwnership` is used to transfer the ownership of the contract to a new address. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `_currentSnapshotId` and `newOwner`. The `_currentSnapshotId` is only modified in the `_snapshot` function and is independent of the ownership transfer process. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
