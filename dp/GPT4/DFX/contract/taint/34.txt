Explanation: The variable `_balances` is a private mapping that stores the balance of each address. It is only modified by internal functions `_transfer`, `_mint`, and `_burn`, which are called within the contract itself. There are no external functions that allow users to directly control or modify the `_balances` variable. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
