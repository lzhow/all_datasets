Yes, `liquidationShares`, the return value of ` calculateLiqudationShare`, is data-dependent on `userPool`, which is a state variable in `Liquidation.sol`. This is because the value is used to calculate the amount of collaterals to be liquidated, which in turn affects the calculation of the alpha rewards.
