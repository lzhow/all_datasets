No.

Explanation: The variable `amt_` in the function `outputRaw` is not data dependent on the variable `_dst` in the same function. The function `outputRaw` takes `_dst` as an input parameter and uses it to encode the function call `iAsmltr.outputRaw.selector`. However, the value of `_dst` is not used in any other calculations or operations within the function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `amt_` and `_dst` in the function `outputRaw`.
