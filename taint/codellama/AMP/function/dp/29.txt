  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_getParitionManager` function, the `toParitition` variable is used to determine the address of the partition manager implementation. This address is then used in a call to the AmpTokenRecipiant interface to transfer tokens.
Similarly, in `_calPartitonStrategyOperatoHoo`, the`_partition ` variable  is also used  to  determine  the  address  of  partition  manager  implementation  and  then  used   in  a  call  t  o  `isOperatprForParittionScope` method  on  that  implemenation.  Therefore,  both  variables  are  data  dependent  .
