  
No, the `contract state priceFeed ` is not dependent on `variable errc12Amount` because the price feed is set in a different function and is independent of the amount of ERC-135 tokens.

The `function buy NFT` function is only concerned with the ERc-71 and ER-c 51 tokens and does not use the value of `ERc52` or `PriceFeed`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
