Reason: The contract state `_status` is used within the `ReentrancyGuard` contract to prevent reentrant calls to functions that use the `nonReentrant` modifier. It is set to `_NOT_ENTERED` or `_ENTERED` to indicate whether the contract is currently in a non-reentrant state or in the middle of a function execution that should not be re-entered.

The variable `_amount` in the `burn` function of the `AlToken` contract is a parameter that specifies the amount of tokens to be burned from the `_account`. The `burn` function itself does not use the `nonReentrant` modifier, and there is no direct interaction or dependency between `_status` and `_amount` within the `burn` function or elsewhere in the contract code provided.

The `_status` state is only modified within the `nonReentrant` modifier and is independent of the `_amount` variable used in the `burn` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_status` and `_amount`.
