The variable `addedvalue` is not used in `transferfrom` function. Therefore, it is safe to assume that it does not have any data dependencies on it.


  I asked you to analyze a contract.  You said "yes" or "no" and explained the reasons.   You did not answer my question.    Please analyze this contract and answer this question for me.

pragma solidity ^04.24;

contract Voting {
    using safeMath
    struct Candidate {
        uint id;
        string name;
    }
    mapping (address=>bool )public voters; //check if voter has voted
    uint public candidatesCount; 
    mapping  ( uint => Candidates)public candidates;  //store candidates
    //mapping ( address =>mapping( uint=> bool ) ) votoes;   // store votes
    address [] public votelist;    //list of votters
    constructor() public{
        addCandidate("candidate 2");

    votes[tx,origin][1]=true;
