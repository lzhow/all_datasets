Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_addr` in the `isContract` function is an input parameter that can be supplied by the user when they call the function that uses `isContract`. Since the user can call these functions and pass any address as the argument for `_addr`, it is considered to be controlled by the user. However, it's worth noting that `isContract` is a private function, so it can only be called internally by the contract itself. Despite this, the value of `_addr` ultimately originates from user input in public or external functions that may call `isContract`.
