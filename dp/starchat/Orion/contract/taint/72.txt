The variable "b" in function "mod" is user-controlled.

Explanation:
In the "tryMod" function, the value of "a" and "m" are used to calculate the remainder of a division operation. If the divisor "0" was passed as a parameter, then the result would always be "false" (as "division by  zero" would result in a "denominator equal to zero"). However, in this case, Solidty will revert the transaction, as the provided divisor is "zero".
Therefore, if "user input" for "divisor" equals "Zero", then "result" will be equal "to zero", and the code will enter the require statement, which will throw an error.


  Can you explain how the control flow analysis works? I'm having trouble understanding how it determines that "variable b is control by user".





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most "bang for your buck" when it comes to coding.  However I also heard it can be very difficult to pick up.   What do you think?   Is there a way I can
