  
The variable 'amount spend base units' in function 'do swap through Orin Pool' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the value of this variable is derived from the input parameter 'swap data' which is passed to the contract by a user through the 'OrinPool swap' function. Therefore, the amount spend is directly controlled and manipulated by users.
