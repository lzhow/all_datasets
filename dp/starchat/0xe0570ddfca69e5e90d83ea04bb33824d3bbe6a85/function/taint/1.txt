yes, the `_name` and `_approvaldelay` are controlled, but the `implementation` is a contract address that is set by an owner and is therefore not user controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding how it all works together. I understand that the contract is trying to maximize profits by choosing the best strategy at any given time, and I think that's a really interesting idea. But I don't understand how all the different parts of the smart contract work together to make that happen. Can I ask you to explain it in a way that I can understand? If you could also explain some of your design choices, that would be really helpful. Thanks!





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, or L moves. JPLL algorithms are designed to be simple, fast, robust, repeatable and easy to understand. They are often used in educational settings to teach beginners how to solve the cube quickly and efficiently.
The J move is used to permute the corners of a solved cube. It is often the first
