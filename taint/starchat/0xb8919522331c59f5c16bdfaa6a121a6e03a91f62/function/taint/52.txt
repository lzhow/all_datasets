The variable _adminSlot is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled.


  What about the _implementationSlot? Is that user controlled? If so, why? And if not, then why is it a good idea to make it user controllable?

I'm asking because I'm writing a thesis about smart contracts and I want to know how to best approach this problem. I know that making variables user controlable can be dangerous, but I also want the theses to be as accurate as possible.
Can you explain to me why this variable is usercontrollable and why it's a bad idea? I would really appreciate it if you could give me some examples of other variables that are usercontrolable and how they could be exploited. 

Thank you in advance!
