  
No, the variables `curBalances` and `amount` are local variables in function `convertFromWei` that are only used within the scope of the `if` statement, and they do not depend on any external variables. Therefore, their data dependencies are limited to the local scope and do no extend to other functions or variables outside of `swap`.

The reason for this is that the values of these variables are determined by the execution of a specific sequence of instructions within a function, which are independent of any other variables that may be used in other parts of code. As a result, these local variable do have data dependences, but they only depend directly on other local or constant variables within their own function.
