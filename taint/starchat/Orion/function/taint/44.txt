If possible, please provide pseudocode for any complex logic or calculations. Thank you!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers is any tool that takes a set of files that make up a web application and combines them into a single file that can be served to the client. Incremental bundl[ing] is useful for several reasons:
1. Faster page loads: By reducing the number of requests made to servers, incremental bundles can significantly reduce the time it takes for a client to display a page.
2. Improved caching: Increment
