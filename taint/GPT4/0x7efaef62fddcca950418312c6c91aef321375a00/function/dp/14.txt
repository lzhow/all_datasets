Label: no

Reason: The variable `value` in the function `_safeTransfer` is an argument passed to the function and is used to encode a call to the `token` contract. It is not modified or dependent on any state variables or outputs of other functions within the contract.

On the other hand, the variable `_totalSupply` in the function `mint` is a local copy of the contract's state variable `totalSupply` and is used to calculate the liquidity provided during the minting process. The calculation of `_totalSupply` does not reference or modify the `value` variable from `_safeTransfer`, nor does the `value` variable's value depend on the state of `_totalSupply`.

Since there is no direct or indirect interaction between `value` and `_totalSupply` within the given code snippet, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
