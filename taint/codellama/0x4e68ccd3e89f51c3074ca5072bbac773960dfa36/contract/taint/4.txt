In the `position` function, the value of `tick` is passed as an argument, and the result of the division operation `int( tick >>8)` is assigned to `wordpos`. The value `uint(8) ( tick%2^8 )`is assignedto ` bitpos` .
Therefore, ` wordpos ` and ` tick ` are controlledby theuser, but `  bit pos ` isnot.
