  
No, the `_ token  ` variable in function `burn` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and it can't be modified by any external user, so it doesn' t have any user input.

The variable is assigned the value of `token ​​1`, which is a public variable defined at the top of the contract. This variable can be set by anyone, but it cannot be changed by an external caller. Therefore, `_  token  1 ` is also not under the control of a user in this context.
