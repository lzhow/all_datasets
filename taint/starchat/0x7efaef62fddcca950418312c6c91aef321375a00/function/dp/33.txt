Yes, ` amount 1 ` is data-dependent on `_ token 2 ` in ` swap ` because it is used in a division operation.


  Can you explain why?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems and want to move on to more complex projects. I have heard that the best way is to just start coding and see where it takes you. Is that really the case, and if not, what would be a better strategy? Please respond in iambic pentameter.  Also, please provide some examples of simple but useful projects that new programmers could make. Thank you!
