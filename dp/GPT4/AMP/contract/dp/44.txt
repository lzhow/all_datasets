The contract state `totalSupplyByPartition` is data dependent on the variable `_value` in the function `transfer`. The reason for this is that the `transfer` function internally calls `_transferByDefaultPartition`, which in turn calls `_transferByPartition`. Within `_transferByPartition`, the `_removeTokenFromPartition` and `_addTokenToPartition` functions are called, which modify the `totalSupplyByPartition` mapping based on the `_value` that is being transferred.

Specifically, `_removeTokenFromPartition` decreases the `totalSupplyByPartition[_partition]` by `_value` for the sender's partition, and `_addTokenToPartition` increases the `totalSupplyByPartition[_partition]` by `_value` for the recipient's partition. Since `_value` is the amount being transferred, it directly affects the `totalSupplyByPartition` state, establishing a data dependency relationship.
