  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiity





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) that are required to run a web application. This includes taking into account the dependencies between these assets, so that they can be loaded in an optimal order. Incremental bundlers are commonly used in development workflows to make the development process more efficient and to reduce the number of requests made to the server when a new page is loaded. They also make it easier to identify and fix errors in code, since any changes made in one file are automatically reflected in other dependent files. Some popular incremental bundle
