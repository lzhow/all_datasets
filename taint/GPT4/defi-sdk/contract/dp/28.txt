The variable `amountsOut` in the function `getAmountsOut` is data dependent on the variable `numerator` in the function `getAmountOut`. The reason for this is that `amountsOut` is calculated by calling `getAmountOut` for each pair and direction in the loop within `getAmountsOut`. The `getAmountOut` function calculates `amountOut` using the `numerator` variable, which is a product of `amountInWithFee` and `reserveOut`. Since `amountsOut[i + 1]` is directly assigned the return value of `getAmountOut`, which internally uses `numerator` to compute that return value, there is a clear data dependency between `amountsOut` and `numerator`.
