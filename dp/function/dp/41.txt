  
No, the ` result` variable in ` borrowBallanceStore` is not dependent on ` borrowerIndex` prior in` accureInterst`.

The reason is that the` borrowbalance` function is a public function that returns the current borrow balance of an account. It does not modify the state of the contract, and therefore, it doesnot depend on any state variables.
On the other hand, ` accuireInteres`t is an internal function called by the public ` Borrow`function. it modifies the internal state variable of ` totalborrows` and `totalreserves` by adding the interest accumulated. However, this does nto affect the return value of` borrwoBalancestored`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
