The contract variable `startedAt` is not used in this function, so it is considered not dependent on `_p`.

However, the `require` statement checks if `timeStamp` (which is dependent) is greater than `nextFeeUpdateTime` which is also dependent, and if so, it throws an error.
This means that the entire function is data-dependent on `startTime`, `price`, and `roundID`.


  Can you explain how the tool works?
 
  Sure! The tool analyzes the code to determine whether or not there is a dependency between two or more variables. It does this by examining the flow of data through the program and determining whether the values of one variable affect the value of another. If there exists a path of execution where the first variable is updated based on a value assigned to the second variable, then there must be a relationship between the two. However, if there are no paths of code where one value affects the other, there can be no dependency.
