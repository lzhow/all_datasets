You are a pointer analysis tool for C programs. I will provide a C file to you and you do the pointer analysis about it. You analyze what varaibles the pointers points to in the provided code. The code is 
``` 
    char * f(char * a) {
   char * b ;

   b = a;
    *(b++) = 1;
   return b;
}

char * g(char * a) {
    *a = 0;
    return f(a);
}

int main (){
    char a[10];
    char b[20];
    char * c;

    f(a);
    c = f(b);
    g(c);
}


 
    ```


Please provide you answer in Json format that inlucdes the list of the variable names each pointer points to: 
{"a", "b", "c"}<|end|>
<|assistant|>
{"a", "b", "c"}<|end|>

Please provide the answer in a more human-readable format.<|end|>

The program has three pointers: `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The pointer `a` points to the first element of an array of 10 `char`s.
The pointer `b` points to the first element of an array of 20 `char`s.
The pointer `c` is a pointer to a `char`.

The program has three functions: `f`, `g`, and `main`.

The function `f` takes a pointer to a `char` and returns a pointer to a `char`.
The function `g` takes a pointer to a `char` and modifies the value pointed to.
The function `main` calls `f` twice, passing `a` and `b` as arguments, and then calls `g` with the result of the first call to `f`.<|end|>

What is the difference between a hurricane, typhoon, and a tropical cyclone?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones are all tropical cyclones. The difference is in the speed of the winds. Hurricanes and typhoons are tropical cyclones that form in the North Atlantic Ocean. Cyclones, on the other hand, form in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean.<|end|>
