  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `function` getAmoutsIn(), the line `uint prev=i-1;` is used to get the previous index of the array. This line is dependent on `i`, which is a variable in `for` loop.
Also, the condition `if (i > 0)` is also dependent to `length`, and `pairs` is an array of addresses. Therefore, `prev` and the length of `array` are also data-dependent on each other.
