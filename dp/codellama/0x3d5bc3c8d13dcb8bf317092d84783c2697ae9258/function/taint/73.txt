  
No, the `` variable in greater than Exp is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function ``greaterThansExp`` takes two parameters ``left`` and ``right`` of type ``Exp``. The ``mangissa`` field of the two ``Exps`` is compared to determine if `` left`` > `` right``, and the result is returned as a boolean. Since the values of ``a``and ``b`` are passed as function parameters, they are not under the control of user and are therefore not considered controlled variables.
