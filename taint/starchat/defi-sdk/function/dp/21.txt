Yes, `depositEth` and `withdrawEth`, as well as `swapEthForExactTokens` are all functions that call `Unicwap` to perform swaps. `IUniwapV3Router02` is a contract that contains the `uniswaps` functions.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "Unicswap". Could you please explain what "unicwap" is?
 
  UnisWap is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows users to swap cryptocurrencies without having to deal with the complexities of traditional exchanges. It is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and allows for the creation of decentralized exchanging and trading of assets. UnicWAP is similar to UniwAP, except it is for Ethereum's native cryptotoken, the Ether (ETH).
