The contract variable 'rewardDistributions' is not dependent on 'minLiqidatinIncetive' in function '_setLiquiationincentiv'. The reason is that the 'liquidatiionInceentiveManitissa' variable is used to set the value of the liquidatiinIncenetivemantiss variable, which is a contract stat. However, the minLiqiudationincetve variable does not affect the rewardsdistributions variable. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
