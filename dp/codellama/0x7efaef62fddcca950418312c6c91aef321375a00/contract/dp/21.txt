  
No, the variables ` liquid` and ` balance` are independent.

The variable liquid is defined as the amount of liquidty that is burned in a transaction. It is calculated based on a number of factors, including the total supply of the liquid token and the current reserves of each token in circulation. Therefore, it is not directly dependent on any other variable in this function.  On the other hand, ` balances` is a variable that represents the balance of a particular token at a given point in time. In this case, we are calculating the `amount` of token  that needs to be burn in order to burn a certain amount `of liquid`. Therefore ` amount` depends on `reserves` which is dependent  on  `total supply` .
