  
No, the ` sqrPricex 9  ` variable in function `getTicAt SqrRation` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` get Tic At SQRRATION` function takes a `uint 8` as a parameter, which is a fixed-size unsigned integer type. This means that the value of the parameter is determined by whoever calls the  function, and it cannot be changed within the body of  thefunction. Therefore, `sqrpricex` cannot  be controlled directly by a user, but rather by someone who calls this function.
