  
No, the ` token` variable in function `safeAutoTranfer` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` safe AutoTranser` function takes in three parameters: `wet`, `tokens`, and `value`. The ` tokens` parameter is a variable that is passed into the  function, and it can be controlled or not by a user depending on how the smart contract is called. However, in this case, ` tokes`n is being used as a parameter to call the safeERc2O. safe Transfer function. This function does not allow the token variable to be modified by any user, so it cannot be considered as controlled.
