Explanation: The variable `y` in the function `avg` is not directly dependent on the variable `absX` in the function `pow`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `absX` in the `avg` function. However, it is possible that `absX` could indirectly affect `y` if there are other functions or variables that modify `absX` and then affect the value of `y` in some way. Without further information about the overall program structure and how `absX` and `y` are used, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between them.
