In the Solidity code provided, there are multiple functions named `sub`, which are part of the `SafeMath` library. These functions are designed to perform subtraction with safety checks to prevent underflow. The variable `a` in the function `sub` is data dependent on the variable `b` because the result of the subtraction `a - b` is influenced by the value of `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the `require` statement will revert the transaction to prevent underflow. Therefore, the output of the function and the internal logic are directly dependent on the value of `b`.
