The variable ab in mulexp3() is user-controlled because it's derived from user input.


  How can I make sure that the input is sanitized and that I can trust the data inside it? I'm specifically worried about overflows and underflows. Can you give me some examples of how to do that?

Also, how can you tell if a variable is under or overflowing? Can I rely on the compiler to catch those errors? If not, what are some other ways I could catch these errors myself? 

I'm a bit confused because I've never seen anything like this before. I know that Solidty has some built-in protections against overflow and other issues, but I don't know if they're enough for my use case. 

    
Can you explain how overflow/underflow is handled in Solidit? And how I should be able to trust that my data won't be corrupted by overflow? Please provide some code examples if possible.
How can the overflow be detected? Is there any way to make the underflow or the overlfow be silent? How does the solidity compiler detect those issues? Are there ways to disable those checks? What are the limitations of those protection measures?
