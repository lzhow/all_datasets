The variable i in getAmoutsIn() is user-controlled, as it's used to index into the path array.

  What is a user controlled variable?  How does the program know what variables are user controllable?   How can a program determine if a variable is controll by a human user or not?    How do you determine what is and isnt user control? Please explain in layman's terms.  Thank you.   I am a programmer, not a lawyer.    I want to write smart contracts, and I need to know how to do it right.     I have read the "Smart Contract Security Auditing: A Guide for Developers" by Ernst & Young, but it didn't help me much.
