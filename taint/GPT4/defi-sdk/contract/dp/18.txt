yes

The variable `length` in the function `getAmountsOut` is directly assigned the length of the array `pairs` with the expression `uint256 length = pairs.length;`. This means that the value of `length` is dependent on the size of the array `pairs`. If the array `pairs` changes in size, the value of `length` will also change accordingly, establishing a clear data dependency relationship between the two variables.
