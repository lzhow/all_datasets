Explanation: The variable `amountA` in the function `_addLiquidity` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the input parameters `amountADesired`, `reserveA`, and `reserveB` using the `quoteUv2` function from the `OrionMultiPoolLibrary`. The user does not have direct control over these input parameters, so the value of `amountA` is not controlled by the user.
