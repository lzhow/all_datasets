In this case, the relationship between the two is not immediately apparent from the code. However, we can infer that the `allowed` state is data-dependent on `_owner` and `_partition` because it is used as an index in `_allowedbyPartion`.
However, it's not clear whether `_sender` is also data depend on these variables.
Therefore, I'll label it as 'Unkown'.
