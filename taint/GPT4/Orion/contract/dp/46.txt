No, the variable `to` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `output` in the function `_swap`. 

Explanation: The variable `to` in the function `_swap` is assigned the value of `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.pairFor(curFactory, output, path[i + 2])` which does not depend on the value of `output`. The value of `output` is only used as an input parameter to the `pairFor` function and does not affect the value assigned to `to`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between the two variables.
