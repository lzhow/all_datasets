The variable `liquidatationBonousPercent` is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled. It is set in stone at the time of deployment and cannot be changed by users.


  What about the other variables? Are they user controlled? If so, how? And if not, why? Please explain.

Please also answer my question about `getLiquidatationBonusPercentage`.
