Reason: The variable `subtractedValue` in the function `decreaseAllowance` is an argument passed to the function and represents the amount by which the allowance is to be decreased. It is used to calculate the new allowance by subtracting it from the current allowance of the `owner` to the `spender`.

The variable `owner` in the function `_spendAllowance` is also an argument passed to the function and represents the address of the owner of the tokens. It is used to check and update the allowance mapping `_allowances` for the `spender`.

There is no direct data dependency between `subtractedValue` and `owner` because `subtractedValue` does not influence the value of `owner` nor is it derived from `owner`. They are independent parameters used in their respective functions for different purposes. `subtractedValue` is used for arithmetic operation, while `owner` is used to access a specific allowance in the mapping.
