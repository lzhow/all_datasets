Reason: The variable `userBorrowShares` in the function `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance` is retrieved from a mapping called `userPoolData` using the `_user` and `_token` parameters. It is then passed to the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount` (which seems to be a typo in the example, as the provided function is `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmount`). However, within the `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmount` function, the variable `pool` is independently retrieved from a different mapping called `pools` using the `_token` parameter. The calculation inside `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmount` uses `pool.totalBorrows` and `pool.totalBorrowShares` to determine the return value, but there is no direct data dependency between `userBorrowShares` and `pool` as they are derived from separate sources and do not influence each other's values within the scope of these function calls.
