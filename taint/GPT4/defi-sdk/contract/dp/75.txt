The variable `actualOutputAmount` in the function `execute` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `handleTokenInput`. The reason for this dependency is as follows:

1. The `execute` function calls `handleInput`, which in turn calls `handleTokenInput` if the token being handled is not ETH or the zero address. This is seen in the `handleInput` function:
   ```solidity
   function handleInput(address token, uint256 amount, Permit calldata permit, address account) internal {
       if (token == address(0)) return;
       if (token == ETH) return handleETHInput(amount);
       handleTokenInput(token, amount, permit, account);
   }
   ```

2. The `handleTokenInput` function uses the `amount` variable to check the allowance and perform a transfer of tokens from the `account` to the contract itself:
   ```solidity
   function handleTokenInput(address token, uint256 amount, Permit calldata permit, address account) internal {
       // ... (code omitted for brevity)
       SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(IERC20(token), account, address(this), amount);
   }
   ```

3. The `execute` function then proceeds to perform a swap operation, which involves transferring the input tokens to the `swapDescription.caller` and then executing the swap through a call to an external contract or function specified in `swapDescription.callerCallData`.

4. After the swap operation, the `execute` function calculates the `inputBalanceChange` and `outputBalanceChange`, which are used to determine the `actualOutputAmount`:
   ```solidity
   inputBalanceChange = initialInputBalance - Base.getBalance(inputToken);
   uint256 outputBalanceChange = Base.getBalance(output.token) - initialOutputBalance;
   // ...
   (actualOutputAmount, protocolFeeAmount, marketplaceFeeAmount) = getReturnedAmounts(
       swapDescription.swapType,
       swapDescription.protocolFee,
       swapDescription.marketplaceFee,
       output,
       outputBalanceChange
   );
   ```

5. The `actualOutputAmount` is therefore dependent on the `outputBalanceChange`, which is indirectly affected by the `amount` of input tokens handled in `handleTokenInput`. The `amount` variable influences the initial state of the balances before the swap, and thus any change in the `amount` would affect the `inputBalanceChange` and potentially the `outputBalanceChange`, leading to a different `actualOutputAmount`.

In conclusion, there is a data dependency relationship between `actualOutputAmount` and `amount` because the `amount` of tokens transferred into the contract affects the state of the contract's balances, which in turn influences the calculation of `actualOutputAmount`.
