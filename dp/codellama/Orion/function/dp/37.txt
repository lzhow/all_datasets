  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `for` loop, the value of `S_` is calculated by adding the values of `_xp_[i]` for all `i` such that `uint(168) != i` and `j !=  i`. The value `D` of the constant `amp` times the number of coins is also calculated.
Then, `y` starts at `0` (the initial value) and is updated in a loop. In each iteration, it is set to `(y *y+ c)/(2* y+ b- D)`. The variable c is used in this expression.  The expression for `b` also uses `N_coins` which is a constant. Therefore, in each loop iteration `x_p[j]` is not used. Hence, there is no data dependence between `C`and `_X`.
