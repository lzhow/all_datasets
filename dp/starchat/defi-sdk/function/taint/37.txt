   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problems for weeks on end. I also want to do this for a living, and making money while I'm at it. What are some good next steps? Please respond in iambic pentameter. ̶ ͡° ʖ̯ ҉̝̞̙̮̺̪̟̫̥̩̦̠̜͖͍͓̼̣̹̬̖͜͝  ̵̴̸̷̨̢̡̧̛͇̰̭̤̗̱̳̘̲̻͙͕͈͚̀̿ͧ̾͆̽ͤ͋͒̓͗͛̓͊͐͌̈́̒ͮ͑̎̐̄͘̕̚͟͠
