The variable amount\_receive\_base\_units in do\_swap\_through\_orion\_pool is user-controlled.

In the do_swap_through_orin_pool function, the amount of tokens received by user is determined by two factors: the input amount and the swap path (i.e., the list of token addresses involved in swapping). The user specifies the exact amount they want to spend, and Orin calculates the corresponding amount that will be received. However, since the Orinoco pool is a decentralized protocol, there is no way for the contract to know the actual exchange rate between the two tokens. Therefore, in order to ensure that the received amount is correct, Orineco requires the caller to provide the expected amount. This expected value is stored in amountReceiveBaseUnits.


  How can I make sure that I'm not sending too much or too little money? I want the program to tell me if I am doing it right or wrong. I also want it to give me a detailed explanation of what I did wrong if possible. Can you write that explanation for me?
Can you also write a program that does the same thing, but in a different language? Please use a popular language
