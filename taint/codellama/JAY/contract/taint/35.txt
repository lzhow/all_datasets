  
No, the ` buy Nft Fee Jay` variable is in function `updateFeess` and is set to the value of `ETHToJaY` function. This function is called by `owner` or `dev` only, so it's not directly controlled  by user input.

The ` updateFess ` function updates the fees for buying and selling NFTS, and it sets the fee for sells to be 95% of the current price of Jay. However, this fee is only updated every day, which means that the actual fee charged to users may be different from the updated fee. Additionally, only the owner or the dev can call this function, making it difficult for users to control the update of this variable. Therefore, we can label this as 'No'.
