Label: no

Reason: The variable `_defaultOperators` is a private mapping defined in the ERC777 contract that keeps track of the default operators for the token. Default operators are addresses that have certain privileges, such as being able to send tokens on behalf of others. The set of default operators is determined at the time of contract deployment and is passed as an argument to the constructor of the ERC777 contract. Once set, these default operators can only be modified by the contract's functions that control operator permissions, such as `authorizeOperator` and `revokeOperator`, which are designed to be called by token holders to manage operators for their own addresses. The variable itself is not directly controlled by users; it is managed by the contract's logic and can only be indirectly influenced by users through the functions provided.
