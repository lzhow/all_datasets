yes

The variable `newAllowance` is data dependent on the variable `value` in the function `safeIncreaseAllowance`. This is because `newAllowance` is calculated by taking the current allowance (retrieved by `token.allowance(address(this), spender)`) and adding the `value` to it (`.add(value)`). The addition operation directly uses the `value` variable, creating a data dependency between `newAllowance` and `value`.
