The variable `_isPartitonStrategy` is a mapping of `bytes` to `bool`. It is used to store the partition strategies that have been registered with the contract.

In the constructor, the `_addPartionToTotlaPartitions` function adds the `defaultPartititon` (which is `0`) to the list of total partitions. This is done using the internal `_totalPartions` and `_indexOfTotlPartitions`.
This is then followed by setting the implementation of the interfaces `Amp` implements. These are `ERC165`, `IERC771`, and `ITransfer`. The `interfaceAddr` method is called to get the address of an implementation for a given interface. In this case, if `iname` equals `PartitionUtils.getParttionStrategyValidtorINam(zeroPrefix)`, then the interface name is `"AmpPartiionStrategyZeroPrefixValidator"`. This interface is implemented by a contract with address `implementation`.


 
Please explain how the code works.
