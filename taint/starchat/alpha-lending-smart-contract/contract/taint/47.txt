The variable _tokens in this function is a reference to an external contract, which means that it can be modified by any function called by this contract. This means the contract is potentially vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

In Solidty, external calls are not reentrant by default. To make this call re-entrant, you need to use the `nonReentrant` modifier.


  How can I fix this? I am using Hardhat and I get the error:
`Error HH604: Compilation failed. See the output above for more information.`
