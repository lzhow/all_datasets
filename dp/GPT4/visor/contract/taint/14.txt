The variable `symbol` in the constructor of the `ERC20` contract is controlled by the user because it is set by the parameters passed to the constructor when the contract is deployed. The value of `symbol` is determined by the argument `symbol_` provided by the user who deploys the contract. Once set during contract creation, it typically remains constant throughout the contract's lifecycle.
