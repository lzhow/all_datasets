  
No, the ` TOKENT_HASHTYPE` variable in this function is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled. It is defined as a public constant in line 10 of the code.

The `hashAccount` function in lines 21-23 of this code uses the constant `ACCOUNT_SIGNATURE_DATA_TOPIC` and the input parameters `input`, `output`, and `swapDescription` to generate a hash of a message that is signed by an account. This hash is then used to verify the signature of an `Account Signer` in a later function.
