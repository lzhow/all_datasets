In the `allowance` function, the `_allowedbyPartion` variable is used to store the allowances for each address. However, this variable does not seem to be directly related to the input parameter `_data` of the`_transerByParition`function. Therefore, it is not clear whether the value of `_allowBypartition` is dependent on `_operatordata`.
