  
The variable _ account in mint function of Altoken contract is labeled as 'No'. The reason is that the _ amount variable is passed as an argument to mint, which is a public function. Therefore, the value of _ accounts is determined by a user and is therefore not under the control of the contract.

In addition, since the minting function does not modify the balance of any user, there is no risk of reentrance.
