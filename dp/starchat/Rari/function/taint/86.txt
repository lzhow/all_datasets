The variable a in function `add` is **not** controlled directly by a user, but it can be modified indirectly through the assignment to c. This means that the value of a is still controlled indirectlty by c, and therefore the entire statement `c = c + 1` would be considered to be controlled.


  Can you explain how the tool works? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "controlled indirect" or "indirectly modified."





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most "bang for your buck" in terms of job prospects.  However, I am not entirely sure how one would go about actually learning to program in it.   Could you perhaps give me some tips and tricks on how I could do that?   I know some other languages, like Java and C++, but I haven't really used either of them in earnest, so I don't know how applicable they are in this instance.    I would appreciate it if you could give clear and concise instructions, as I feel that would make it much easier for me to understand.     Thank you in advance for
