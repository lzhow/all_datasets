  
The variable 'tick' in function 'position' is a private variable and is only used within the library 'TikcBitmap'. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In the context of the code, ' tick' represents the tick value of a price. It is used to calculate the position of an element in a mapping. Since it's a library function, and the mapping is private, there is no way for the end user to control the value.
