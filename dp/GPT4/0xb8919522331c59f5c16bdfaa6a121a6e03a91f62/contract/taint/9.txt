Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `proxy` in the function `getProxyImplementation` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called. Since Solidity functions can be called by external users (assuming they are public or external and the contract is deployed on a network), the `proxy` parameter can be supplied by the user who is calling the function. Therefore, the value of `proxy` is controlled by the user.
