  
No, the variables ` value` and `data` are independent.

The ` decode I3 2` function uses the ` data` variable, which is a local variable in that function, to store the decoded data and return it. On the other hand, `  decode Bytes6 4` uses a different local ` raw`variable to decode the data from the input bytes. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
