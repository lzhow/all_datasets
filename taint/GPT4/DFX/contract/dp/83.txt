Label: no

Reason: The variable `_omega` in the function `calculateTrade` is calculated within the same function using the `calculateFee` function. It is dependent on the parameters passed to `calculateTrade` and the `curve` state variable, specifically on `_oGLiq`, `_oBals`, and `curve.weights`.

On the other hand, the variable `_lowerAlpha` in the function `enforceHalts` is a local variable that is calculated within `enforceHalts` using the `curve.alpha` state variable and is used to enforce certain conditions within that function.

There is no direct data flow or dependency between `_omega` and `_lowerAlpha` as they are calculated and used within their respective functions and do not influence each other. The scope of `_lowerAlpha` is limited to the `enforceHalts` function, and it does not affect the state variables or parameters that are used to calculate `_omega` in `calculateTrade`.
