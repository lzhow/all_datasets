The variable x in function `sub` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of x is used in an arithmetic operation that requires it to remain unchanged, which means that it may be modified indirectly through other variables.

For example, if x was user-controlled, and the program then assigned a new value to x (e.g. x = 5), the subtraction in `z=x-y` would still use the old value 4 for y, resulting in a wrong result.


  Can you give me an example where the input is user controlled? I want to see the code





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most "bang for your buck" in terms of job prospects.  However I also heard it can be difficult to pick up.

    Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code written in Python can run without requiring compilation. This makes it easier to get started with Python, as there
