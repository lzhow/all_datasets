Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the size of the code at a given address, which is determined by the `extcodesize` opcode in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This variable is independent of the `success` variable in the function `functionStaticCall`. The `success` variable is used to indicate the success or failure of a `staticcall` operation, which is a different EVM opcode used to execute a read-only call to another contract. There is no direct data flow or dependency between the `size` variable and the `success` variable as they are used in separate functions for different purposes and do not share state or influence each other's values.
