  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `function` ` get Pool`, the local variable  `Pool storage` is defined.
`Pool` has a member variable called ` total Borrow Shares`.
This variable is assigned a value in ` function` get ` Pool`.  The value is `pool .total Borrows`.   The ` pool` variable has been defined in a previous line.  It is a `struct` that contains a number of members, including `al Token Address`, `last Update Timestamp`, and `status`. The variable` pool ` is also a local  variable in this function. It has not been assigned any value.   In the` function`, get` User Account`, there is no variable named ` compound Borrower Balance`. However, there are two local variables named` compounding Liquid Balances` and`compounding Borr Bal`. These variables are assigned values in an inner loop. These values are used to calculate the value of `Total Liq Bal`and ` Total Bor Bal`, which are then used in calculations to determine the values of` total Liqq Bal Base` , `tota Collater BalBase`,and`total Bord Balbase`. In this context, the variables ` totaliqbalbase` are dependent on `Compound Liqui Bal ` and  the  variables` totcollbal base`are dependent  on`Compounding BOrrBal`.
