  
The label is 'No'.

In the `add` function, the value of `z` is calculated as ` x+y`. In the  ` sub`function, ` z`is calculated  as  x-y.  The value  of  the variables ` y` and `  z ` are independent in both functions. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions and the answer is No.
