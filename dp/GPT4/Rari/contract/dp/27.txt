Yes, the variable `borrowAmount` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is data dependent on the variable `cToken` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp`. 

Explanation: In the function `updateCompBorrowIndex`, the variable `borrowAmount` is calculated using the `CToken` contract's `borrowBalanceStored` function, which takes the `cToken` variable as an argument. This means that the value of `borrowAmount` depends on the value of `cToken`. 

In the function `distributeBorrowerComp`, the `cToken` variable is passed as an argument to the `updateCompBorrowIndex` function. Therefore, the value of `cToken` in `distributeBorrowerComp` affects the value of `borrowAmount` in `updateCompBorrowIndex`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
