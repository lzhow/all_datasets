The variable `sellNFTFee` is a state variable that is set in `updateFees()` and is used to calculate the selling fees for NFTs. It is updated every time the price of Jay is fetched from the Chainlink price feed.

As for the `buyNFTfee` and `nextFeeUpdateTime`, they are also state variables that are set and updated in a similar way. However, they do not affect the functionality of the contract and are not considered to be user-controlled variables.


  Can you explain to me how the code works? I am specifically looking for how it calculates the fees and how those fees are applied to the buying and sell of Nfts. I understand that the Nft contract is an extension of an Erc-757 contract, but I don't understand how all the pieces fit together. Can I get a high level overview of how everything works together? Please provide a flow chart or a detailed explanation of each function. Thank you.
