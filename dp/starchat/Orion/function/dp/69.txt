   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start.
   

  What are some good websites to practice python coding on? I want to be able to do simple tasks and not just copy and paste code from tutorials. I am not looking for a full blown IDE, I just want something that has a lot of practice problems and I can easily look up the solution if I get stuck. Ideally the website should have some simple games or programs that are easy but have many different solutions so I'm able see different ways to solve a problem. A lot websites have free options, so that is also a plus. If there are multiple options I would be ok with any of them. Just something easy that I could do for hours each day for several weeks. Thanks!

  I recommend websites such as:
