  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `pairfor` function, the variables `curfactory` and `tokens` are used to calculate the address of the pool.
`cur factory` is passed as an argument to the `_doswaptokes`function.  The `tokens` variable is used in `OrinMultiPollLibrary` to get the reserves of `pool`.
Therefore, `TokenB ` is data-dependent on ` initialtransfersource` because it is calculated using the value of`initialtransfer source` passed to `_ doswaptoknes`.
