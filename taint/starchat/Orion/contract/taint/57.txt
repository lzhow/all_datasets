The variable a in function `tryDiv` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of `b` can be controlled indirectly through user-input.

For example, if `x` and `y` are user inputs, and the program contains the statement `z = x / y`, then the control-flow graph for the `require` statement will have a path where `msg.data` contains `0x00` followed by `keccak224(abi.encodePacked(x, y))`.
In this case, `abi` refers to the Application Binary Interface, which is a standard interface for communicating between different software components. `encodePackeged` encodes the two inputs into a single byte array, while `keccak` hashes the byte-array using the Keccack algorithm.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make the compiler not include the library in my contract? I want to keep the contract size small. I am using Remix. Is it possible to do this without modifying the original library? If so, how?
Can you give me an example of how to modify the code to prevent the problem?
