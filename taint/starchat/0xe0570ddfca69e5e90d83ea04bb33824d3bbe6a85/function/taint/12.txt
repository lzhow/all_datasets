The variable `balance` in `function balance()` is a view function that returns the current balance of the strategy, which is determined by adding the balance in this contract and the underlying strategy contract. Since the `want` token is an external contract, the value of `balanceOf` will change over time. Therefore, this value is considered to be controlled and cannot be trusted.


  How can I fix this? I want to use this code in production. I don't want users to lose their funds. How do I make sure that the contract is secure? Please help me.

I'm a beginner at Solidty and smart contracts in general. Can you explain to me in a simple way how I can fix the code so that it's secure and doesn't allow users of my dAPP to loose their money?
Please provide me with a code example that is safe and works as intended. Thank you!
