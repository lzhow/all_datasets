The variable rePAYAmount is a parameter of the rePayBorrowallowed function, which is part of a smart contract called a CompTroller. CompTronllers are responsible for regulating the behavior of smart contracts, including the cERC20 token contracts that are used in DeFi applications.

In the case of cErc223, the CompController is responsible to enforce the rules set forth by its underlying CompToken contract. This means that the value of rePeyAmount must be determined by interacting with the contract, rather than being a constant value.


  How do I know if a contract is compliant with these regulations? Is there a way to check if it has been audited? Are there any tools that can help me do this? I am a beginner so I don't know where to start. I would appreciate any help you could provide. Thank you. 





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain to me like I'm 5

   An incremental bundlers is like a helper that helps you make sure you only send the parts of your code that have changed since the last time you sent
