  
No, the variables ` suppli er` and ` comp Remaining ` are independent.

The function  `distribute Supplier Comp` is called in `flywhee lPre Suppli e rAction` which is triggered by the `set Comp Supply Speed` function. This function updates the comp supply index and distributes comp to suppl iers based on their comp balances.  The ` grant Comp Internal` funtion is only called by ` claim R ewards` , which distrubutes comp rewards to holdrs based  on comp accrual. Therefore, ` supply er ` and  ' comp remaining ' are  independent variables.
