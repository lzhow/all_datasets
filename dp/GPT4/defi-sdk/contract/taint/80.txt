Label: no

Reason: The variable `ETH` is declared as an `internal constant` with a hardcoded address value. This means that its value is set at compile time and cannot be changed by users of the contract. It is not a state variable that can be modified through any function calls or transactions initiated by users. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
