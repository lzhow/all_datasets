In the given code, the `pool` variable is declared as a `Pool` storage type, which is a struct that contains a mapping of `address` to `ERC-2O` tokens.
`poo` is initialized with the value of the mapping at the address of `_toke`n.  The `calculateRoudnDownLiqidtyAmount` function is called with `_tok`en and `userLquidityshares` as arguments. `UserLQuidtyShare`s is calculated by calling the balanceOf function on `_user` and `_t`oken. This means that the state of`pool `is dependent on`_token`.
