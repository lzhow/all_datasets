Explanation: The variable `to` in the function `safeAutoTransferFrom` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function, but the source of the value is not clear from the given code. The function `safeAutoTransferFrom` can be called by any address, so the value of `to` can be controlled by the caller of the function. However, without additional information about how the function is called and where the value of `to` comes from, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not.
