Explanation: The variable `allowed` in the function `borrowFresh` is not data dependent on the variable `totalFuseFeesNew` in the function `_withdrawFuseFeesFresh`. There is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `totalFuseFeesNew` in the code snippet of `borrowFresh`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
