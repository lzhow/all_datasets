Yes

The variable `_amount` in the function `giveAlphaToStakePool` is controlled by the user because it is a parameter of a public or external function. This means that when a user calls the function, they can pass any value they choose as the argument for `_amount`. Therefore, the value of `_amount` is determined by the user at the time of the function call.
