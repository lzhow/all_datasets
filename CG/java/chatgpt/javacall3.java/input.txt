You are a java call graph analyzer for programs. I will give you a java program 
        and you tell me its call graph. 

        The input file is 
        ```
        public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount(1000);
        myAccount.deposit(500);
        myAccount.withdraw(200);
        System.out.println("Current balance: " + myAccount.getBalance());
    }
}

        ```
