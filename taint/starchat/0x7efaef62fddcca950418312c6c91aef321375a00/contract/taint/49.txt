   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies.

    An incremental bundle is like a big box that you can put all your code in and it will take care of figuring out what needs to be included in your final bundle, and how to optimize it.

    The key feature of an increment bundling system is that it only rebuilds what has changed since the last time you built the bundle. This makes it very efficient for large projects, because it
