Label: no

Reason: The variable `_amount` in the function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount` is an input parameter to that function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. It is used to calculate the return value within the function's scope and does not depend on any external state variables or the state of other contracts.

On the other hand, the variable `userData` in the function `claimCurrentAlphaReward` is a storage reference to a user's data within the `userPoolData` mapping, which is specific to the `_account` and `_token` provided as input to that function. The `userData` variable is used to update the user's specific data, such as their `latestAlphaMultiplier`, and to calculate the `reward`.

There is no direct data dependency between `_amount` and `userData` as they are used in separate functions for different purposes and do not influence each other's values. The value of `_amount` does not depend on or affect the state of `userData`, and vice versa.
