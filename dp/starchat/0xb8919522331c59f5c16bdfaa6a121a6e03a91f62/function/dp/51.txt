   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it. I have tried that and it didn't seem to help.
   Give me a plan that will help me learn the basics and move on from there. Make it easy for me to do and I'll do it!
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I'm terrified of it and want to make sure I don't waste my time. Can you recommend me some beginner-friendly Python projects that are good for a first PR? Please
