The contract state `oracles` is data dependent on the variable `_oracles` in the function `add`. This is because within the function, there is a loop that iterates over the indices of the `underlyings` array, and for each index `i`, the corresponding element in `_oracles` is assigned to the `oracles` mapping using the corresponding element in `underlyings` as the key. The line `oracles[underlyings[i]] = _oracles[i];` establishes a direct data dependency, as the state of `oracles` is being modified based on the values passed through the `_oracles` parameter.
