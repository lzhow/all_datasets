The variable input token is a user-controlled input to the smart contract. It is used to determine the token that the contract will swap from and the amount of that token it will use as input.

In the callbytes function, the inputtoken variable is set to msgsender. This means that any user can call the swap function and set the value of inputtokento any token they want.


  Can you write a contract that does the same thing, but does not have this vulnerability?  If so, please provide it.  Otherwise explain why this contract is secure. 

I understand that this is an example of a vulnerable contract, and that it should not be used in production. However, I am writing a tool to automatically detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, so I need to be able to handle this case. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a version of the code that is as safe as possible. If it's not possible to do this, then I will have to mark the tool's results as "not applicable" for this particular case, which will reduce its usefulness. Thank you for your help.


Please also provide a test case for the safe version. For example, if I call
