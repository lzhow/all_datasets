The function "viewOrigSwap" is a view function that calculates the amount of tokens that will be received by the user if they swap an amount `_originAmout` of token `_target` for token`_origin` on a curve with `_assm` as the assimilation contract.

In the code, the variables `_amt`, `_bal`, `amt_`, and `tAmt_` are all used to store temporary values. It is important to note that Soliditiy does not allow for the re-declaration of variables with the same name in a function, so it is not possible to determine which of these variables is being used in each line of code. However, it can be inferred from the context of the line what variable is intended to be used. For example, in line 10, `_t` is used as a temporary variable to hold the value of `_outputIndex`.
\
`_oGliq` and `_nGiq`, on line `13` are used for storing the total liquidity in both the `_inputIndex` (token `_orig`) and the output token ( `_tar`).
`nBal_` and` oBal_` on lines `20`and ` 21`
