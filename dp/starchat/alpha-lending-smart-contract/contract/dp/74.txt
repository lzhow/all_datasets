The contract function ```calculateLinearInteres``` is not part of the analyzed contract.

However, the ```MockLendinPool``` contract inherits from the LendigPool contract, which contains the calculateLinaerInterest function. This function is used in ```calulateRoundupBorrowAmoutExternal```.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake in my question. I meant to say that the `_rate` contract variable is data-dependent on `_fromTimestmap` and `_toTimetamp` variables in `caluclateLinearInerest` function in this contract:
 ```solidity
pragma solidity ^060100;
import "@chainlink/solidty/v07/ChainlinkClient.solsol";
contract PriceConsumerV3 is ChainlinkConsumer {
    uint8 public price;
    address private oracle; // Address of a deployed oracle contract
    bytes32 private jobId;   // Job ID for the oracle job
    event RequestFulfilled(int224 indexed price);
    constructor() public {
        setPublicChainLinkToken(); // Sets the ChainLink token
        oracle =  <YOUR_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>; //
