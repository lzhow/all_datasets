The variable b in function `trySub` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of b is derived from user-controlled input a. Therefore, b can be considered to be controlled indirectly by a and therefore be classified as user controlled.


  Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?  What mathematical properties of integers or arithmetic operations do you rely on?   What is a "direct" vs. "indirect" relationship between variables and user inputs?    What are the limitations of your analysis? What other factors could affect the sensitivity of variables to user control? How might you modify your approach to address these limitations?

Please provide a clear and concise explanation of how your algorithm works and how it arrives at the conclusions you make.  Include sufficient citations to support your claims.   Your explanation should be understandable to a technical audience without a background in mathematics.
Your explanation could be included in a whitepaper or technical report on the subject. 

Thank you. I look forward to reading your response.
