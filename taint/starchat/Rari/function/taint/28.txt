The variable accountTokens in this function is unknown because it depends on the value of msg.caller, which is a user-controlled value.


  What is an example of a situation where the msg caller is user controlled?  What are some examples of how this could be exploited?

I'm trying to understand how to prevent common vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks.  I understand that the attacker can set the caller to a contract that contains the attack code, but how can I prevent that contract from being called in my own code?  

Is there a way to check the call stack to see if I'm already in a call to that function?   If so, I could just return or throw an error.
Can you give me an explanation of the exploit you're referring to? I'd like to better understand the context. 

Thanks!
