Explanation: The variable `dy` in the function `getAmountOutCurve` is not directly dependent on the variable `factory` in the function `getAmountInCurve`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `factory` in the calculation of `dy`. However, it is possible that `factory` indirectly affects the value of `dy` through the function calls `pairForCurve`, `get_coin_indices`, `get_xp`, `get_y`, and `curveDecimalToBaseUnit`. Without further analysis of these functions, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between `dy` and `factory`.
