  
No, the variables `D` and ` N _CO INS ` are independent in function  ` get _D ` and function` get y `, respectively.

The reason is that the ` D ` variable in ` function _get _ D` is calculated based on `xp` array and` amp` variables, which are passed as arguments to the` function_get D`. The ` x p ` array is not modified in`function _ get D`, so the value of `x p` does not change during the execution of` _function_ getD`. Similarly, `amp` variable is also not changed during execution, so its value doesnot change. Therefore,` D _`variable is independent of the values of variables` N COIN S`and` x P`in`get y`
