In the constructor function, the `_symbol` variable is assigned a value, but it is not used in any way. It is also not passed as an argument to any other function.
On the other hand, in ` decrease Allowance` function the ` _ name` is used as a parameter. However, it does not seem to be used to determine the value of `_ name`.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether `_ symbol` and `_ _ _` are dependent on each other.
