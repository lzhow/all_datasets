The variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeDecreaseAllowance` is data dependent on the variable `value` in the same function. This is because `newAllowance` is calculated by subtracting `value` from the result of `token.allowance(address(this), spender)`, which is a call to the `allowance` function of the `IERC20` token contract. The subtraction operation directly involves `value`, thus establishing a data dependency relationship between `newAllowance` and `value`.
