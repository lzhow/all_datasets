The variable `amt_` in the function `outputRaw` is not data dependent on the variable `data` in the same function. 

Reason: The variable `amt_` is assigned the return value of the function `delegate(_assim, data)`, which is the result of calling the `delegate` function with arguments `_assim` and `data`. The `delegate` function does not use or modify the `data` variable internally, so there is no data dependency between `amt_` and `data`.
