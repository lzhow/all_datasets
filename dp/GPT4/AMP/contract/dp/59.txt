Reason: The contract state `swapTokenGraveyard` is a constant address defined in the contract with the value `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`. This address is used to represent a "graveyard" for tokens, typically a burn address or a place where tokens can be sent and are effectively removed from circulation.

The variable `_operatorData` in the function `_transferByPartition` is a parameter that can be passed to the function and is intended to provide additional data for the transfer operation. This variable is used within the function to call hooks (such as `_callPreTransferHooks` and `_callPostTransferHooks`) that may be implemented by token sender or recipient contracts to validate or perform additional logic associated with the transfer.

Since `swapTokenGraveyard` is a hardcoded constant and does not change based on the state of the contract or the execution of functions, and `_operatorData` is a function parameter that is not used to modify `swapTokenGraveyard`, there is no data dependency relationship between `swapTokenGraveyard` and `_operatorData`. The value of `swapTokenGraveyard` remains the same regardless of the value or use of `_operatorData`.
