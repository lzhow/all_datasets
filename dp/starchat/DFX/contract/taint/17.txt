The variable curve in function `targetSwap` is **not** controlled directly by users. However, the variables `_swapdata` and `_recipient` are controlled indirectly by user input.

`_swap_data._recipent` can be controlled via the `_recipient` parameter in `function targetswap`.
`function viewtargetswap` does not take a `_reciepient`, so it cannot be directly controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what you mean by "controlled indirectlty by input".





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has many different ways of doing things, but I don't know which one would be the best way for me to start learning.
