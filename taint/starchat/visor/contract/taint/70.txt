   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, and L moves. J and P are the basic algorithms used in JP-LL algorithms, while L is often used as a twist.
The J algorithm (Jâ€™) is designed to solve the first layer of the cube. This involves finding the white center and the yellow cross. To do this, you need to find the edges that are adjacent to white and yellow, then move the adjacent edges to their correct positions. Once the center is in place, move one of your corners to where the other two corners used were. Finally, swap the two adjacent corners. In the case of a solved cube, this will put the corners in their final positions, but in an unsolved cube it will not. However, if you repeat this process enough times, eventually the algorithm will find a solution. For
