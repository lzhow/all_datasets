  
No, the ` output Ind` variable in function `_swap Curve` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and it can't be modified by any external user or attacker.

The ` _ swapCurves` function takes in several parameters, including `curve`, `input`, and `amount`, but it does not take in any user input that could be used to control the value of `outPutInd`.
