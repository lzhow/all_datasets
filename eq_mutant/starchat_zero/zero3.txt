The two code blocks are *not* semantic equal because the mutated code block still has the exact same runtime behavior as the original code, while the unmutated (i.e., the control flow graph in the form of a program after some optimizations) code does not have that behavior. This can be seen by first removing the `else` branch in each `while` loop, which allows for an infinite loop. The mutator then rewrites this code in a way that removes the loop that could otherwise infinitely execute, and so the resultant code has different behavior (even though both code do the sort in practice).
