The variable err in function `exchangeRrateStored` is data-dependent on variable result in `exchangRateStoreInternal`. This is because the value of err is assigned in that function, and the subsequent code depends on that value.

However, the variables err and result are local variables in each function. They are only used within the scope of the respective functions, so there is no data dependence between them.


  Can you explain why the code does not have data dependencies?
 
  The code has data flow dependencies because of how Solidty handles assignments. Specifically, Solidit assigns values to variables from right to left. This means that if a variable is used before it is defined, it will have the default value for its type (e.g. 0 for integers).
