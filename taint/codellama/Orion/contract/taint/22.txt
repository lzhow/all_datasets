  
The variable amountMin is a parameter of the add liquidty from exchange function. It is passed as an argument to the internal function `_add liquidy`. The internal `_ addliquidy` function does not modify the value of ` amountamin`. Therefore, the `addliquity` is labeled as 'No' because it doesnot control the amountmin.
