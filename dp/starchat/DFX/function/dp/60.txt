   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all the time and not being able to apply what I have learned. I want to create something useful, but I don't know where to start. Some courses are very long and complicated, while others are too basic. What should I do? I also donâ€™t know which python IDE is best. Can you recommend a few good tutorials or a python ide? Thank you!
   

  What are some good alternatives to using a mouse?  I've tried using one for years and it hurts my wrists.  A keyboard and a trackpad are much more comfortable.   I'm considering buying a new mouse, any recommendations?   Thanks.

I've also tried typing with a keyboard, and while it's faster than using the mouse to select text, it still takes longer to type and I still have to move my hands away from the keyboard to use the computer.    I really like the feel of a mechanical keyboard. Is there a way I can get one?
Thanks.
