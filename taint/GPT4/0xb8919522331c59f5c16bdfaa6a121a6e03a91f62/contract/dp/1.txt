Label: no

Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` and the variable `target` in the function `functionCall` are parameters of their respective functions. Each function has its own scope, and the parameters are local to that scope. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `account` and `target` within the given code. They are used independently in different functions to perform different actions, and the value of one does not influence or determine the value of the other within the provided context.
