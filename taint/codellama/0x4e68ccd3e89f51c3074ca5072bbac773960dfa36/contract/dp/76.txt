  
No, the variables ` time` and ` info` are independent.

The variable  `update` is a function that updates the `Ticket.info`. The variable` time `is a parameter of the` update` function, which means that it is not dependent on any other variable.  The function` cross` also has a variable called` info`, but it does not update the value of`info`, it only reads the current value. Therefore,`time `and` information`are independent variables.
