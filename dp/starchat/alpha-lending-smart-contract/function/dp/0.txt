Yes, ` collateraAmount ` is data-dependent on ` liquidatShares ` in this function.

The reason is that ` calculateColleteralAmount() ` function is called with ` _liqudateAmount `_ and `  _colletera`_ as arguments. ` LiqudrateShares `_ is used to calculate ` maxLiquidateShare `_ which is then used in `calculateRoundupBorrowAmout()` to calcuate ` liqudatAmount `. ` CollateralAmmount `_ depends on both of these variables.


  Can you explain why it is dependent?
 
  The reason it's dependent is because the value of `maxLiquidationShare` is determined by the `liquidityShares`, which in turn is calculated based on `_liqdateShares`.
