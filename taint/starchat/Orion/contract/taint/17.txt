The variable reserveIn is a control variable in a swap function. It is used to calculate the optimal amount of tokens to be swapped. However, the value of reserve input is determined by a combination of the balances of all the tokens in an account. This means that the reserve variable is dependent on the state of an entire account, which is typically stored on a blockchain. As such, this variable cannot be directly controlled or manipulated by an individual user or smart contract.


  How can I prevent the smart contracts from being hacked? I heard that some people are trying to exploit the OrinSwap smartcontract. How do I know that it's not possible for my contract to get hackered and how can i make my smartcontracts more secure?
