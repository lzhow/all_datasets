   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but this is my first time trying to program. Can you recommend a few good resources for me to use to get started with python, along with some examples of simple programs that I can make?
