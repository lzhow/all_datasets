  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `function mint` of the given contract, the `_mints` function is called with two arguments: `_account` and `_amout`. The `_acount` argument is a variable that is passed to the external function, while the`_amount `argument is also a local variable in this function.
Because the value of `_ amount` is used as an argument to `_ mints`, it is data-dependent on `_ account`.
Therefore, in conclusion, we can say that the state of` _balance`is data depend on`  _ amount `in the mint function of this contract.
