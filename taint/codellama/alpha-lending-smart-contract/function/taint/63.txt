In the `accumulateAlphatoUser` function, the value of ` supply` is calculated by calling the public view function `balancOf` on the Alphatoken contract. This function returns the current balance of the contract, which is a publicly accessible value that is determined by on-chain transactions. Therefore, ` suppy` cannot be controlled directly by a user and is considered to be a constant value.
