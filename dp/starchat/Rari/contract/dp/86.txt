   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used a lot of other coding languages, and I'm not really sure what makes python special. Could you give me some advice? I know it's important to have fun and enjoy the process, so I'd love it if you could provide me with projects that test my skills and keep me motivated. If that's too hard, I totally get it, you donâ€™t owe me any of that. Just let me know how I can learn to love and excel at coding. Thanks a ton!
