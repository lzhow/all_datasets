   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
c = list(a)
print(c)


what does list do? what is special about the syntax a = [] when compared to just a=list()?

    To learn Python, you can start by reading the official Python documentation. It provides a comprehensive guide to the language and a lot of examples that can help you get started. Additionally, there are many online resources available
