The variable seizedGuardainPaused is a state variable in CompTroller contract. It is used to control the pause status of seizing function in CTokens.

In the current version of CompTrller contract, the seizure function is only used by CETH and CSAI contracts. These two contracts are the only ones that have seizable assets. Therefore, in this version, seizationGuardaiPaused variable is set to true for all Ctokens.


  What is CETH and why is it seisable? What does seise mean? Is it possible to seiize CTOKENS? If so, how? Please explain in detail. I am confused. Thanks.
