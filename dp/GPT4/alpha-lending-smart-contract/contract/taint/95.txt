Reason: The variable `_amount` in the function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmountExternal` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is part of the contract's interface and can be called by external users or contracts. Therefore, the value of `_amount` is provided by the user who calls the function, making it controlled by the user.
