   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I currently have a decent amount of experience in other languages such as C++ and Java, but I have never really done any coding. 

1. Start with the basics: If you're new to programming, you should start with basic programming concepts, suchas variables, data types, loops, and conditionals. These will help you to understand the basic structure of Python code.

2. Learn from examples: Start by reading code examples and tutorials that demonstrate how Python can be used to solve common problems. This can help make the learning process more concrete and easier to follow. 

3. Practice: Regular practice is key to improving your programming skills. Try to write code on your own, or work on small projects that are related to your interests or hobbies. It can also be helpful to seek help from others who are more experienced with Python.

Remember that learning Python takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and keep practicing. Good luck!
