  
The label is 'No'.

In the `_addTockenToParition` function, the value of `_balanaces[_operator]` is updated based on `_to` and `_partition`. However, in `_calPostTranferhooks`, the `toParititionprefix` is calculated based only on ` _ topartition` which is not dependent on`_operator`. Therefore, `_valu`e is independent of` _ operator`in` `_ callPosttransfer hooks`.
