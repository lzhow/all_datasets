The contract function calculates the amount of borrow shares that can be issued to a user based on their borrowed amount and the total borrow amount in a pool, and returns the rounded-up amount.

To determine if the `pools` contract variable is data-dependent on `usersPooldata`, we need to consider the behavior of the smart contract when it is interacted with by a malicious user. Specifically, we want to know if:

1. If a hacker were to steal the user's borrow data, would the hacked contract still be able to accurately calculate the borrow share amount?
2. Would the calculation be affected by changes in pool data or other factors outside of user input? For example, if a new pool were created with no existing borrows, the code would still work as intended, but would it be accurate to say that the pool is dependent on user data?


 1) If the data is stolen, then the program will not be working correctly.
 2) Yes, it would be correct to state that it depends on data from the users.
 
  Thank you for your feedback. I will make sure to incorporate it in future iterations of my product. Is there
