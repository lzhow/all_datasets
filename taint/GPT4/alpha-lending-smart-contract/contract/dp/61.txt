Reason: The variable `_useAsCollateral` in the function `setUserPool` is used to set the `disableUseAsCollateral` property of a `UserPoolData` struct instance, which is associated with a specific user and token address. This variable is used to control whether the user's deposits for the specified token can be used as collateral.

On the other hand, the variable `_token` in the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmountExternal` is used as an argument to call the `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmount` function. This function likely calculates the amount of borrow shares rounded up to the nearest valid increment for a given amount of the specified token.

There is no direct data dependency between `_useAsCollateral` and `_token` as they are used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions. `_useAsCollateral` affects the user's ability to use their deposits as collateral, while `_token` in `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmountExternal` is used for a calculation related to borrow shares. There is no indication in the provided code that these two variables influence each other's values or behavior.
