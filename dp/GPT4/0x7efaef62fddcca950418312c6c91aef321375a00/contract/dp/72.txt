The variable `_reserve1` in the function `_mintFee` is data dependent on the variable `amount1` in the function `mint`. The reason for this is that `_reserve1` is used to calculate the liquidity fee and the state of the reserves, which is then used to mint new liquidity tokens. The `amount1` variable represents the amount of token1 that is being added to the pool, which affects the reserves and thus the calculation of the liquidity fee. When `mint` is called, it calculates the amounts of tokens to be added to the reserves, and then `_mintFee` is called to potentially mint new liquidity tokens as a fee to the feeTo address. The new liquidity tokens minted as a fee are based on the difference between the current reserves and the new reserves after the mint operation, which includes the `amount1`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `_reserve1` and `amount1` as the value of `amount1` influences the calculation of the fee and the update of the reserves within the `mint` function.
