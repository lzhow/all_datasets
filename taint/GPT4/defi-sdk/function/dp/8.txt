yes

The variable `inputToken` is directly data dependent on the variable `callerCallData` because `inputToken` is assigned a value through the decoding of `callerCallData`. The line:

```solidity
(address inputToken, address outputToken, address[] memory pairs, bool[] memory directions, SwapType swapType, uint256 fixedSideAmount) = abi.decode(callerCallData, (address, address, address[], bool[], SwapType, uint256));
```

shows that `inputToken` is initialized by decoding `callerCallData` using `abi.decode`, which means that any changes to `callerCallData` will affect the value of `inputToken`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `inputToken` and `callerCallData`.
