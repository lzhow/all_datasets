Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `ratio` in the function `getSqrtRatioAtTick` is computed based on the input parameter `tick`, which is provided when the function is called. Since the function is marked as `internal`, it can only be called from within the contract or from derived contracts, but the value of `tick` that ultimately influences `ratio` can originate from user input if the contract's design allows external users to influence the `tick` value through a transaction. Therefore, without additional context on how `getSqrtRatioAtTick` is used within the contract, we must assume that `ratio` can be indirectly controlled by the user, hence the label "yes".
