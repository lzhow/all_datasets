The variable _symbol in this function is unknown as it has not been specifically declared as a state variable in Solidty. However, the _name variable is known to be a string and is therefore controlled.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "state variable". Could you please explain what a "variable" is in solidity and how it relates to the concept of "user control"?
 
  A state or local variable, in computer programming, is a variable that is used to store data that can be modified during the execution of a program. In Solidit, state variables are declared at the contract level and are used for storing data related to that contract.

In the case of the code you provided, there is no state declared for the symbol variable. Therefore, this variable cannot be controlled directly by a user, and its value is determined by other factors in a contract's execution. This means that the value of this symbol cannot directly be changed by an external party. 

However, if you were to add a symbol state to this contract, then it would be possible for a party to change the name of that token by calling the setName function and passing in their desired symbol. For example:
