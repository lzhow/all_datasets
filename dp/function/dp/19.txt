  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `divScalerByexp` function, the local variable 'numeratior' is calculated by calling the 'mulUint' function with the arguments 'expScales' (a constant) and `scalar` (an input parameter). The result of this function call is then passed to the getexp function.
On the other hand, in ` mulexp`, the result is returned by the mul exp function which is called with two arguments, `a` and` b`.
Therefore, numeratir is data-dependent on ` b` because it is used as an argument to `getexp`.
