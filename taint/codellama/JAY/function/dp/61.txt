There is no direct data dependence between the `contract state sellNFTFessEther` and the local variable`ids`. However, the value of `msg.value` is used to determine the amount of Ether to transfer to the seller, which is stored in ` sellNFTEthFunds`. The value in`sellsNTFEThFounds` may be affected by the length of the array ` ids`, but this is not a direct dependence.
