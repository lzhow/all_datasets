  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `getWETH` function is a public function that returns the value of the private variable `_wETh`. The variable is declared as `private immutabe`, which means that it cannot be changed after it has been initialized. Therefore, `Wet` is initialized with the address of a WET contract, and the `_WtH_` variable cannot change.
Therefore, The ` wET H` in ` get Wet H ` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a private and immuteable variable.
