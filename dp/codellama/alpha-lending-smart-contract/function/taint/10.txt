  
The variable _ totalL liquidity in function  get Utilization Rate is labeled as 'No'. The reason is that the _TotalL Liquidty variable is a function parameter, which means that it can be passed in by a user when calling the get utilisation rate function. However, the value of this variable cannot be changed within the scope of the contract, as it has been passed as a parameter to the external function call. Therefore, this value is determined by an external entity and is therefore not considered to be controlled directly by any user within this contract.

In contrast, variables such as base borrow rate, rate slope 2 and collate percent are labled as "yes" because they are directly controlled within contract by user through constructor function and can change their value.
