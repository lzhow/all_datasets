  
The variable ctoken in distrbuteBorerComp function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a parameter of the  function.

In the context of a smart contract, a user is typically the entity that interacts with the contract and initiates transactions. A user can be a person, an organization, or even another smart contact. In the case of this contract' s distrubute borower comp function, the c token is a paramter of  the funtion, which means that it cannot be controlled directly by a  user but rather by other internal functions.
