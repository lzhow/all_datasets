  
No, the variables ` compSpeedy_ ` and ` supply Speeds ` are independent.

The variable  ` suppplySpeed ` is a parameter of the `_ setcompSpeeeds  function` and is used to set the value of `  comp Supply Spee  d` for a given ctoken.  The variable` comp Accruedy _` is defined in `updateComp Suppy Index` function and it is updated based on `compsupply speed` of a c token. However, these two variable are used in different context and are therefore independent of each other.
