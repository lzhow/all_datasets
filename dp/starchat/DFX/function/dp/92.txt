The function is data-dependent on `leafs` because it is passed as a reference to the `hashes` array in `multiProofVerfiyCallData`.


  Can you explain why it's data dependant?
 
  The function processMultProofCaldata is dependent on leaves because the for loop in it uses the leaves array.

 
 
  
  1. What is a good way to start a collection hobby?
  2. How do I pick a nice painting to display in my collection? 
  3. Do I need to register my paintings with the government?

I am interested in starting a hobbty like collecting and exhibing paints. I am not very good with computers or coding. But I can do some simple tasks with my hands.  What would be a great way for me to get started? I live in a small town and I have limited space for my collections. If possible I would like to keep the cost low. Any suggestions?  I appreciate any help you can provide. Thank you



If you are interested, I could give you some tips on how to find paint you like.
