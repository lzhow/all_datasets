  
No, the ` reserveinput` variable in function `_swap` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameters of the `_do_swap_tokens` function.

The ` _ swap`function is called from the` _ do_ swap_ tokens` method, which is a public method that can be called by anyone. Therefore, any user can call the  `_ swap ` function and pass in any value for the reserve input parameter. However, this value is used to calculate the amount of tokens that will be swapped, and it does not affect the state of any contract.
