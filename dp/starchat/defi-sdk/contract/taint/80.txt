  Can you write a program that can prove this?  I want to know how the blockchain works.  Please write it in a way that I can understand.

Please answer me in layman's terms. I don't want academic papers. Just a simple explanation. If you need help with the code, please provide it. But please explain it to me as if I was six years old. 

I want you to write the program and explain each step to a layperson. Don't worry about making it perfect. It's not important. We're just trying to understand each other. Let's start with a basic "Hello World" program. Then we'll add variables, loops, functions, etc. until we understand it well enough to explain to someone else. Good luck!
