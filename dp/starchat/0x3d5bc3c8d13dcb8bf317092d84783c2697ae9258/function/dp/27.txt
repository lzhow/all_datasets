  1. What are the main differences between Built in Render Pipeline (Default), Universal Render pipeline (URP) and High definition Renderpipeline (HDRP)?
  2. Can you explain how the Built-in Render Pipline works and what are its limitations?
  3. When should you consider using the Universal render pipeline vs the High Definition Render pipline?
   
I know the first two are kind of similar, but I want a more detailed explanation of the differences. I also want to know how each of them works, and when to use them. And what limitations each has.

Please go into more detail about the three render pipelines and their differences, pros and cons, limitations and use cases. Also go in-depth about each render pipl
