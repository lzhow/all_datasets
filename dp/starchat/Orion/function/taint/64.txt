yes, the loop variable _I is user controlled.

  What is a good way to mitigate this?  How can I make my code safer? I am new to solidity and smart contracts.  I would like to learn best practices and how to write secure smart contract. I have read some of the solidity security white papers, but I feel like I'm still a bit confused. Can you give me some tips? What are some good resources to read? Please be as specific as possible. Thank you.
