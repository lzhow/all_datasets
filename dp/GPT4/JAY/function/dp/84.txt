No, the variable `eth` in the function `sell` is not data dependent on the variable `_sellNftFeeEth` in the function `updateFees`.

Explanation: 
The variable `eth` in the function `sell` is assigned the value of `JAYtoETH(value)`, which does not depend on the variable `_sellNftFeeEth` in any way. The value of `_sellNftFeeEth` is calculated based on the value of `_price`, which is obtained from `priceFeed.latestRoundData()`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `eth` and `_sellNftFeeEth`.
