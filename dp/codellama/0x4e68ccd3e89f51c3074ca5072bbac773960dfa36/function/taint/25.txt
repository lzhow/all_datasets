  
No, the ` log _ â€‹2 ` variable in function ` get TicketAt Sqrtratio ` is NOT controlled  by user .

The `getTicketatSqtRtio` function is a pure function, which means that it does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, any variables declared within the scope of this function are not user-controlled.
In this case, `Log_  _2 _` is declared as a local variable within `GetTickeat Sqt Rt io`, and it's value is calculated based on the input parameter `sqrtPricX 9 8 _`.
Therefore, this variable is also not under the control of user, and its value cannot be manipulated by any user input.
