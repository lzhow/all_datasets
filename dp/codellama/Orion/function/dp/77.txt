  
The label is 'No'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the local variable 'c' is defined and assigned the value of 'a' multiplied by 'b'. However, this variable is not used in any subsequent operations, and it is only returned as the result of the 'mul' function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between ' b'  and  ' c' .
Similarly, in  the second function , the  local  variable  c  is also defined  but  not  used  for  any  subsequent  operations.  Therefore , there  no  data  dependence  between  b  an  d  .
