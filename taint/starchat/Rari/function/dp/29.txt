Yes, `finishInterestAcrrual` and `_SetReservefactorFresh` are dependent on each other.

The reason is that the `reserveFactor` is used in both functions to calculate the interest accrued.


  How do I fix this?
 
  You can fix the issue by removing the line that sets the value of `acccualblocknumber` to the current block number. This line is unnecessary because the blocknumber is already being set in `checkpointinterest` function. 

Here is how the code would look like after the change:
 ```  function _checkpointBorrowInterest() internal {
        uint _totalborrowsbefore = _getTotalBorrrowBalance();
        if (_totalborrowbefore > 0)
        {
            uint acc = (_block.number - borrowindex.block) * borrowrate;
            borrowbalance = acc;
        }
        borrowinterestacuumulated += borrowacc;
    }

    function checkpointInterest (  uint  borrowrmantisas) internal  {
         _checkpoints[borrowindexforcheckpoint].block = block.numer;
         borrowcheckpoint.borrowrmantisa =borrowratemantissas;
          borrowcheckpoin.accbalance =
