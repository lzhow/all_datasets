Label: No

Reason: The variable `account` in the function `mint` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. However, the `mint` function is modified by `onlyOwner`, which means that only the owner of the contract can call this function and specify the `account` parameter. Since the owner is typically a specific address set during contract deployment and not any arbitrary user, the `account` variable in this context is not controlled by any user but rather by the owner of the contract.
