  
No, the ` amountDesire` variable in function `_addliquidty` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The `add liquidtyFromexchange` function calls the `_ addliqudity` internal function and passes the amount desired for each token as parameters. Therefore, `amoutDeside` in `_adliquity ` is a variable that is passed as a parameter and is therefore not under the control of the end user who calls ` add liquidtiyFrom exchange`.
