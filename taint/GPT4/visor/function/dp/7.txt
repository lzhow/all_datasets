Label: unknown

Reason: The provided Solidity function `mint` takes two parameters, `account` and `amount`, and calls an internal function `_mint`. However, without the implementation details of the `_mint` function, it is impossible to determine whether `_totalSupply` is data dependent on the variable `amount`. The `_mint` function is likely to interact with `_totalSupply` since minting usually increases the total supply of tokens, but without the code for `_mint`, we cannot confirm the data dependency relationship. Therefore, the relationship between `_totalSupply` and `amount` is unknown based on the given information.
