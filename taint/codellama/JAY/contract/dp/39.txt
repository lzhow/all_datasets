  
No, the variables ` success` and `_ p_ scope_ â€‹0 ` are independent.

The variable` success ` is a local variable in function` sell ` and is not used in any other function. It is only used to check if the transfer of Ether to the user was successful. Therefore, it is independent of the other variables in this function and does not have any data dependencies.  On the contrary, variable  `_  p _  scope _  0  `  is used as a parameter in a function call to ` pricefeed. latestRoundsData () ` in ` updatefees () `. This function returns the latest price data from the price feed, which is then used by the ` sell ()  function to calculate the Ethereum amount to be transferred to users. This means that the value of `_   p  _ scope  __  o  '  depends on external factors such as the current price of JPY, and therefore has a dependency on other data.
