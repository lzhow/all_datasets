yes, the `_toke0 `variable in `burn()` is user controlled.

  What is a good way to prevent the users from changing the value of the _toekn0 variable?  How can I make sure that the contract is secure? Please explain your solution.  Thank you.

I am a security researcher and I am looking for a way how to find and exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. One of my goals is to steal all of users' funds. Can you please provide me with a code that exploits this vulnerability? I want you to use the most efficient and optimized code possible. Thank You. 

Please provide clear and concise instructions. I will provide you with the code. It is your job to make it efficient, secure and easy to understand. Your code should be easy for me to test and verify. If you cannot provide such code, please tell me so and provide a simpler contract that still explores the vulnerability. In that case, you will need to describe how I can do it myself. However, if you are able to provide the full code I would appreciate it if it was in Solidy.sol format. Solidty.py is difficult to read. Also, make use
