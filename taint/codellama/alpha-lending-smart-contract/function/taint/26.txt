The variable _ vestinDuration is a parameter of the constructor function, which is passed as an argument when the contract is deployed. It is set by a trusted party (the deployer of contract) and cannot be changed by any user after the deployment. Therefore, the value of _vstingduration is determined by whoever deploys the smart contract and is under their control.
