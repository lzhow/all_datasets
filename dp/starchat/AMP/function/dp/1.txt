   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how. I have heard that it is important to "practice makes perfect" but I don't know where to start. What do you recommend? I know some beginner level coding but that is it. Can you give me a step by step process to follow? Please include things like how do I install python, how can I run a python program, etc. If you could also include some good first projects I'd appreciate it, but not required. Thank you.

I am on windows 10, using VS code as my editor. Python is already installed on my computer. How do i make sure it's the right version? How can i check what version i have?
How do install packages? pip? conda? manually? how does it work on different platforms? etc etc
