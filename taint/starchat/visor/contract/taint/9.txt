Yes, the `Shares` variable in `deposit` is user-controlled.

The user specifies the amount of VISR to deposit, and the number of shares to mint. This means that the value of `visrsDeposit` and `vVisrTotalSupply` can affect the resulting value for `share`.
In the case where `totalShares == 1`, the equation reduces to `x = y`, so the result is always `1`. In this case, `isUserControlled` would be `false`.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make sure that `user` cannot manipulate the values of the variables? I want to prevent the possibility of a user manipulating the code to steal the funds.
