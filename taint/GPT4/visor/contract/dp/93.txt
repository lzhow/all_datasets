The variable `c` in the function `tryMul` and the variable `b` in the function `tryMod` are not data dependent. In Solidity, each function's local variables are scoped to that function and cannot be accessed by other functions unless passed as arguments or returned as outputs. Since `c` is a local variable within `tryMul` and `b` is a local variable within `tryMod`, there is no direct data dependency between them. They are independent calculations within their respective functions.
