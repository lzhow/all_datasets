Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_allowances` is not directly referenced or modified in the function `getBuyJayNoNFT`. This function calculates a return value based on the `amount` parameter, `totalSupply()`, and `address(this).balance`, without any interaction with the `_allowances` state. `_allowances` is typically used in ERC20 contracts to keep track of how much one address is allowed to spend on behalf of another address. Since there is no interaction with `_allowances` in the `getBuyJayNoNFT` function, there is no data dependency relationship between `_allowances` and the variable `amount` in this context.
