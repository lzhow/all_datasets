  
No, the variables ` user` and ` amount AMIN` are independent.

The variable user is a parameter of the `doSwaTthroughOrinPool` function, which is not used in any way in `_ add Liquidit`y. Therefore, it is independent of `amounTAMIN`.
Similarly, ` amounTAmin` is an internal variable of `_ adLiuquit`, which does not affect the value of` user`. Therefore they have no data dependence.
