yes

In the provided Solidity function `setVestingAlpha`, the contract state `vestingAlpha` is directly assigned the value of the input variable `_vestingAlpha`. This establishes a data dependency relationship between the two, as the state of `vestingAlpha` is directly influenced by the value passed to `_vestingAlpha` when the function is called. Therefore, any change to `_vestingAlpha` when invoking this function will directly affect the state of `vestingAlpha`.
