In the `functionDelegateCall` function within the provided Solidity code, the variable `returndata` is data dependent on the variable `data`. The reason for this is that `returndata` is the result of the `delegatecall` operation which is directly invoked with `data` as an argument. The `delegatecall` is a low-level call that executes the code at the target address with the provided input data (`data`) in the context of the calling contract. The output of this execution is stored in `returndata`. Therefore, any changes to `data` would affect the execution and potentially alter the contents of `returndata`. This establishes a clear data dependency relationship between `returndata` and `data`.
