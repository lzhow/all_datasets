yes, it is data-dependent.

The reason is that the value of ` feeGrowsAbove` is computed based on `self[upper]`, which is a state variable that is updated based off of the current function call. Therefore, `upper. feegrowthOutside` will be updated before `lower.feegrowthoutside` and therefore `feeeGrowhInside` would be affected by the change in ` upper.feeGrownOutside`.


  Can you explain why it's data dependant?
 
  The reason itâ€™s data depends on is because the calculation of fee growth inside the loop is dependent on a value that changes within the same loop.
