   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am currently in high school, and I took AP Computer Science A in High School. Is that enough to get started with python, or do I need to take an additional class? If so, what would that class be? And should I start using python right away, even if I know it will take a while to become proficient? I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice on how best to tackle this. Thank you!
   

  What are some good textbooks for learning Python?  I'm specifically looking for books that will help me learn the language from scratch.  Please provide a list of 5-15 books.

Please also include some information on prerequisites, like what version of Python is required, etc.  

I'm looking specifically for beginner-level books, not books on intermediate or advanced topics. 

Thank you for your help!  This is very important to me, as
