  
The variable 'input' in function 'hash' is a parameter of the type 'Input' which is defined in 'Struct.Sol'. The 'struct' ' Input' contains two fields 'tokenamount' of type Tokenamount and a 'perit' field of Type Permittype.

Both 'Tokenamount ' and' Permits' are defined as 'public' variables in their respective structs, which means they are not private and can be accessed by anyone. Therefore, the 'variable' input' can not be controlled solely by a user, but rather by any external contract or user who has access to the contract.
