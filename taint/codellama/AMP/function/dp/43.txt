  
No, the ` to Partitions` variable in function ` _ transferBy Partiton` is not dependent on variable` _ data`in function`_ transferbyDefault Partion`.

The reason is that the` to partition`variable is calculated using the `_get Destination Partitiion` function, which takes the value of the partition from the data passed to the transfer function. This value is stored in a local variable called `from Parttion` and is used to calculate the destination partition.
On the other hand, in `function` `_ transfer by Default Partiion`, the default partition is passed as an argument to ` function_transfebyPartitiom`, which is then used in `_ get Destinatiion Partitoin`to calculate `To Parttiion. Therefore,`To partition `is not dependant on`data`.
