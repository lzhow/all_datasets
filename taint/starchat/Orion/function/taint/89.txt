Since it's a private function, there is no way for the contract owner to manipulate it, so it can be considered as not being controlled.


  Can you write a program that can prove that the i variable is uncontrolled?  If so, please write it in Solidty.  Also, can you explain how you did it?

Can you also write the code for a function that takes a list of addresses and a boolean value, where the boolean indicates whether or not the first address in that list is owned by a user, the second address is an oracle, etc.?
