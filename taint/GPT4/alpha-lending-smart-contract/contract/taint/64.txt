Reason: The variable `WAD` in the `WadMath` library is declared as a constant with a value of `1e18` (which represents 1 followed by 18 zeros, or 10^18). Since it is a constant, its value is set at compile time and cannot be changed during the execution of the contract. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
