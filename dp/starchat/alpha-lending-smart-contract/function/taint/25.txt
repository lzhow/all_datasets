The variable `owner`, which is of type `address`, is a state variable in Soliditiy contracts. It is used to store the address of the contract's owner, and it can be modified by calling the `transferOwnership` function, which only the owner can call.

In this case, the `_asset` parameter of `getAssetPair` is an `indexed` input parameter, meaning that it will be stored as part of a log event and can later be used for filtering and searching. Since the value of `_pair` will not be changed by any other function in this contract, we can conclude that the state of this variable is "not controlled" by user input.


  Can you explain how the code works? I am specifically looking for the part where the mapping is created and how it works. I understand that you are using a library to get the reference data, but I don't understand how that library is connected to the rest of your code. Can I use this code as is, or do I need to modify it? Can the library be replaced with another one? If so, what would be the best one to use? Please explain your design choices in great detail. Thank you.
