Label: no

Reason: The variable `j` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is used as an index variable in a for-loop to iterate over the `swapData.path` array and populate the `new_path` array. It is independent of the `amountOut` variable, which is used to store the output amount of a token swap operation. The calculation of `amountOut` does not rely on the value of `j`, nor does the value of `j` change based on the calculation of `amountOut`. They are used in different parts of the function and for different purposes, with no direct data dependency between them.
