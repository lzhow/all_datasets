  
The variable 'b' in add Exp is a parameter of the add function. It is passed as an argument to the method when it's called. Therefore, the value of ' b' is determined by whoever calls the 'add' function, and it can be controlled.

Therefore, we label ' yes' for the question "is the parameter 'a' of function ' add' controlled  by user?"
