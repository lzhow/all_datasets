There is no direct data dependence between the `Input` variable and the state variable. However, the data in `protocol_fee_signer` is used to calculate the hash of the signature, which is then used in a signature verification function. This means that the value of `Protocol_F_Sign_er_` can affect the outcome of this function, but it is not directly dependent on `inp_ut`.
