The variable "success" in function "functionCallWithvalue" is data-dependent on variable  "value". This is because the value of "this.balance" depends on "msg.value", which is set by the caller of the "target" contract.


  What is a "data dependency"?
 
  A data dependence is when one variable depends upon the state of another variable. In the example you gave, the success variable in " function callWithValue" function is dependent on value variable, which in turn is determined by " msg.Value" variable which comes from the calling function. This means that the data in success is affected by changes in value.

In the case of a smart contract, data dependencies can be used to determine if a transaction can occur without causing any issues. For example, if the smart contracts state is changed by a function, then any function that depends of that state must also be re-run to ensure that it is still valid. If the dependent function does not run, it may cause issues with the overall state. 

Data dependencies are also used in other areas such as in compilers and computer graphics. They are used for optimizations such that only the necessary data is recomputed when a variable
