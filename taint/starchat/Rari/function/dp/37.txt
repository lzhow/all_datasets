The variable result in subexp is data-dependent on scalar in mulscalar because it is used to compute the return value of the subtraction.


  Can you explain why it's data dependant?
 
  The result variable in function "subExp" is dependent on both the "a" and "b" variables. It is computed by subtracting the mantisses of "Exp memory" objects " a"and " b". The "m" variable is a uint256, which is an unsigned integer of 2^264 bits. This means that the maximum value that this variable can take is 57896044618658097711790849334032419552, or 1.15*10^76.

Now, let's consider the case where "scalar" in "mulscalar()" is equal to 3. In this case, the value assigned to "scaledMantissas" will be  a.M *  scalar. Since "M" can have values up to  1*  (1<<220), the result
