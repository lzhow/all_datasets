  
No, the variables `_ factory` and `factores` are independent.

The variable ` _ factory ` is a constant that is assigned a value in line 3 of the constructor function. It is not dependent on any other variable or function in this contract. On the other hand, ` factores `is a public variable that can be modified by the ` updateFactory ` function, which is called in ` getFactoryLength `, but it is also a separate variable and not directly dependent upon `_ factor`.
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is no.
