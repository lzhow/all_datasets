The variable `returndata` in the function `_callOptionalReturn` is data dependent on the variable `data` because `returndata` is assigned the result of the function call that uses `data` as an argument. Specifically, `returndata` is the result of the `functionCall` method from the `Address` library, which is called with `data` as one of its parameters. This means that the value of `returndata` is directly influenced by the value of `data`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
