  What is a "data dependency"?
 
  A data dependence is when one variable depends on another variable. In the example you gave, the simple interest factor is dependent on both the repayments amount and the borrow balance. If the balance changes, so does the interest. This is because the calculation of the new interest is based on how much money is borrowed.

In the case of repayment, it is also dependent upon the amount of money that was borrow. When you reimburse someone, you are essentially reverting the debt that you owe. So, if the person owes more money than you have, then the repayment will reduce the total amount owed, and therefore reduce your interest rate. However, this is not the only factor that affects interest rates. Other factors such as the inflation rate, which affects the value of your money, can also affect interest payments. These factors are all dependent data that affect the rate at which you pay interest on your deposits. 

So, in summary, a simple example of a variable depending on other variables is that the
