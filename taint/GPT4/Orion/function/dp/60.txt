Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `D` in the function `get_D` is not directly dependent on the variable `factory` in the function `get_xp`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `factory` in the calculation of `D`. However, it is possible that `factory` indirectly affects `D` through its usage in other functions or contracts that are called within `get_xp`. Without further analysis of the codebase, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between `D` and `factory`. Hence, the label is unknown.
