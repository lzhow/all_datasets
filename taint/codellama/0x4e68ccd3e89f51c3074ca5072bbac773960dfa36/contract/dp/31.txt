  
No, the `ObservedTime` variable is not dependent on `afterOrBefore` because it is calculated using the difference between the block timestamps of `before` and `After`. The `blockTimestap` of the two observations are used to calculate the time delta between them, and this time difference is used in a division operation to compute the observation time.

The `timeDelta ` variable does not depend on any other variable in ` observe `, so it can be considered independent.
