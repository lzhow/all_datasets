  
No, the `CTokenn` variable in function `_setcompSuplyspeed` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a parameter of the  function.

The function is called by admin and the admin is responsible for passing the correct `ctoken` address. Therefore, `Ctoken` cannot be controlled directly by a user and is considered safe.
