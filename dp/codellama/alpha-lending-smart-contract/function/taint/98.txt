  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the given code, the `poke` function is a public function that is called by anyone. However, there is no input parameter that allows the caller to specify the value of `lastpockBlock`. Therefore, `block. number` is used to determine the current block number, which is determined by miners and is publicly accessible.
Therefore, while the code does not explicitly allow the calling user to control the index variable, they can still manipulate the blockchain to change the lastpocket block, and therefore the behavior of the contract. Therefore the answer is unknown.
