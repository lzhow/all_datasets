  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `delegate` function, the `_data ` variable is passed as an argument to the callee contract. This means that the data in `_amt` is dependent on `_assem` and `_dst`.
Then, in ` output Raw`, the value of `_amount`is passed to ` delegate` as `_ data`. This makes ` _ amount` dependent  on ` data` .
Therefore, ` am t_ ` is data-dependent on` data ` in` output raw`.
