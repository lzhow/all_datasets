In the `getUserCompondedLqudityBallance` function, the local variable  `Pool storage` is defined. This variable is initialized with the value of the pool at the address of `_token`. The `balanaceOf` method is called on this variable to get the liquidity shares of a user.
  The `_liqudate` variable in `liqidationInternal` also has the same type and name as the `_toke`n variable. However, it is passed as an argument to the  function.  This means that the two `_ token` variables are different. Therefore, ` userLiqdutySharess` and `_ liquidationShars` are independent.
