  
No, the ` id` variable in `buJyWithErc 51` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` buyjaywitherc5` function is called by another function, ` bujy`, which is also a public function. Therefore, any user can call `  buy jay with er c5 ` function and pass any value for the id parameter, which means that the value of the` id ` variable is under the control of a user and not the contract.
