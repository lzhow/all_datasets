  
No, the `_ outputI x` variable in get Target Swapp Data is NOT controlled  by user because it's a private function and it doesn't accept any user input.

The function is called by other functions in this contract, and the value of `_input ix`, `_o GLi q`, and `_n GL iq` are calculated based on the values of the other variables in that function. Therefore, `_ o Bals` and `n BALS` can be controlled only by those variables.
