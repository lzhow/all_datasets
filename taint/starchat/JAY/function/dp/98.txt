The function ``JaytoEth`` has a variable that is data-dependent on a state variable in ``Ethtojay``. This is because the value of the state variables in each function is dependent on each other.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-depended" in this context. Could you please rephrase your question?
 
  Data-dependence is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value depends on another. In the context of smart contracts, data dependence refers to how the values of variables used within a smart contract depend on one another, and how those values are updated over time.

In the example you provided, the variables ``value`` and ``totalsupply`` are both used to calculate the return values for the two functions. If the total supply of Jaycoin changes, for example, then the calculation for ``ethtojai`` will be incorrect, because it is based on an outdated value for totalsupply. This means that the data for these two values is "dependent" on other data, which is why they have the term "depend" instead of "influence."
