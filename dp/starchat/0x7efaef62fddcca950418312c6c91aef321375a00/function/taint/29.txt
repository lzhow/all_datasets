The variable token is a contract address. It is possible for the contract to be self-destructed and become worthless. In this case, the token will not be able to transfer any funds and the balance will remain  zero.


  How can I prevent this from happening? I want to keep track of the balances of all my tokens. I need a reliable way to get the current balance of each token in my contract. How do I do this? Please provide an example Solidty code if possible.

I also want you to explain how I can calculate the price of a token using Uniswap V3. Explain it step by step. Provide an implementation example in Solidit if it's possible





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
A common approach to optimize web application delivery is to use a bundling tool that can analyze dependencies between modules and generate a single file that contains all the code, including dependencies, in a way that optimizes loading and execution time. This process is called bundl[ing] or bund[le] and is often referred to as an incremental bundli[er].
An incremental bundle is created by analyzing the dependencies of an application
