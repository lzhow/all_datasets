   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn about the topic for a university assignment. Thank you!




An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This allows for faster loading times as the browser only needs to load a small number of files rather than a large number, and makes it easier for the developer to manage and modify the code.
