The variable in the function `allowanceByPartition` refers to `_allowedByPartition[_partition][_owner][_spender]`, which is a mapping that holds the allowance of a spender for a specific owner's tokens in a particular partition. The function `decreaseAllowanceByPartition` modifies this same mapping by decreasing the allowance for a spender in a specific partition, as indicated by the `_partition` variable. The line `_allowedByPartition[_partition][msg.sender][_spender].sub(_subtractedValue)` in `decreaseAllowanceByPartition` directly affects the value that would be returned by `allowanceByPartition` for the same `_partition`, `_owner`, and `_spender`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the variable in `allowanceByPartition` and the `_partition` variable in `decreaseAllowanceByPartition` because they both reference and modify the same state in the contract.
