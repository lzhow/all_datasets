The variable "computedhash" in line 39 is a user-controlled variable. It is used to store the result of the hash function, which is then compared to the Merkel root in order to verify the proof of ownership.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding it. I think it's important to understand how it works so I can debug it if necessary. Can I ask you to explain it to me in a simple way? Please provide a high-level overview of how each function works and what it does. If possible, please provide pseudocode for each step. Thank you!
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand the logic behind the smart contract. Here's a brief overview:

- The "library" keyword is part of Solidty and is similar to a class in other programming languages. This is where we define the functions that we can use in our smart contracts.
In the library, we have two functions: "verify" and "processProof". The verify function is called by our contract and takes in three parameters: proof (an array of bytes), root (a single bytes) and leaf (also a single byte). The process proof function does
