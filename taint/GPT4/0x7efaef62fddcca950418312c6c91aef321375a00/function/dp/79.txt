Label: no

Reason: The contract state `SELECTOR` is not mentioned anywhere in the provided function `_mintFee`. Since `rootK` is a local variable within the `_mintFee` function and there is no interaction or assignment between `rootK` and `SELECTOR`, there is no data dependency relationship between them. Data dependency would require that the value of one is calculated based on or affects the other, which is not the case here. Without additional context or code showing a connection between `SELECTOR` and `rootK`, we can conclude that they are not data dependent.
