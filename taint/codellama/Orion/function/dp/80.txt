In the `function` getAmoutInUniswap, the factory type is determined by the value of the parameter `from` and `to`. The `amountIn` is calculated based on this ` factorytype` value.
On the other hand, in ` function` ` getamountsout`, the` factory` parameter is used to determine the type of factory.  The` amountin` variable is then calculated using the result of this factory determination. Therefore, ` amount in` depends on ` factor` because the calculation of ` amoutin ` depends  on` factor`.
