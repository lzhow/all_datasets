Reason: The variable `_totalSupply` in the ERC777 contract is a private state variable that represents the total supply of tokens in the contract. It is modified by the internal functions `_mint` and `_burn`, which are called by the contract's public functions that are designed to create new tokens or remove tokens from circulation. These functions include access controls to ensure that only authorized users (such as the contract owner or designated operators) can mint or burn tokens. The `_mint` function is called within the constructor of the `n00dToken` contract, which is only executed once when the contract is deployed, and it is typically controlled by the contract deployer. After deployment, the control over minting or burning tokens depends on the contract's implemented access control mechanisms. In this case, since there are no public functions exposed by the `n00dToken` contract that allow arbitrary users to mint or burn tokens, and the `_mint` and `_burn` functions are not directly accessible, the `_totalSupply` variable is not controlled by arbitrary users.
