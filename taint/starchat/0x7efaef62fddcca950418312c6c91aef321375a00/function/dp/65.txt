Yes, `Balance0adjusted` is data-dependent on `Data` because it is used in a require statement.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to a course that will probably end up teaching me nothing but painful memorization of arcane syntax and arcanely poor error messages. I want to do something useful with python, like build something. But I also want a career that's worth it, and learning to write python code just to have something to show for it seems like a waste. What do you recommend? I'm a recent college graduate with some experience in other languages, but I've never really done any coding. And I don't want this to turn into a full-time job. Just a hobby or something I can do on my own time. Thanks.

I'm not asking you to teach me python. That would be crazy. No, I just want you, dear AI assistant,  to give me some good advice on how and where to start. How do I learn the basics
