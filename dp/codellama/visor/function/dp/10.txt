  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `totalSuplly` function, the value of `snapped` is determined by the return value from the `_valuesAt` method. Specifically, `bool snapped, value = valueAt(_totalSuplySnapshot, snapshotID)`. The `value` variable is dependent on `uint snapshotid` and `Snapsnots storage snapshot`. Therefore, it is data-dependent on both ` snapshot`and ` snapShotID`.
