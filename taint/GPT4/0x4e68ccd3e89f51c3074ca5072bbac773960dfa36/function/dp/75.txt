Yes

The variable `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` is data dependent on the variable `tickUpper` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside`. This is because the value of `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` is used in the conditional statements that determine the value of `feeGrowthAbove0X128`. The condition `if (tickCurrent < tickUpper)` checks the relationship between `tickCurrent` and `tickUpper`, and depending on whether this condition is true or false, `feeGrowthAbove0X128` is either set to `upper.feeGrowthOutside0X128` or `feeGrowthGlobal0X128 - upper.feeGrowthOutside0X128`. Since `feeGrowthInside0X128` is calculated using `feeGrowthAbove0X128`, which in turn is derived from `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` based on the value of `tickUpper`, there is a data dependency relationship between `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` and `tickUpper`.
