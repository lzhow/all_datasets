Label: no

Reason: The variable `_reserve1` in the function `getReserves` is assigned from a state variable `reserve1`, which is not modified or referenced in the function `_safeTransfer`. The variable `token` in `_safeTransfer` is a parameter that is used to make a call to an external contract, and it does not interact with the state variable `reserve1`. There is no code indicating that `token` has any influence on the value of `reserve1`. Therefore, `_reserve1` and `token` do not have a data dependency relationship.
