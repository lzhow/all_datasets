The ` getnextsqrtpricefromoutput` function takes `sqrpx9`, `liquity`, and `amountout` as parameters. `SQRP`X`9 is a user-control variable, but it can be manipulated by a malicious user through the` amountout `parameter. This is because the value of ` amount out `can be controlled directly by an attacker. Therefore, ` SQRT`P `X `9 ` is considered uncontrollable by users.
