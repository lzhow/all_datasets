The variable `success` in the function `delegateTo` is data dependent on the variable `callee` because `success` is the result of the `delegatecall` to the address contained in `callee`. The `delegatecall` is a low-level function call that executes the code at the target address (`callee`) within the context of the calling contract, with the provided `data` as input. The `success` variable captures the success status of this call, which directly depends on what code is executed at the address `callee`. If the address or the code at that address changes, it could affect the outcome of the `delegatecall` and, consequently, the value of `success`.
