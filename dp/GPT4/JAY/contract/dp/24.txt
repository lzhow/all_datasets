The contract state `nftsBought` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyERC1155`. This is because the `amounts` variable represents the quantity of each ERC1155 token being bought, and the total amount bought is calculated within the `buyERC1155` function by summing up all the `amounts`. This total is then used to update the `nftsBought` state variable in the `buyNFTs` function, which calls `buyERC1155`. The line `nftsBought += total;` in the `buyNFTs` function directly shows the data dependency, as `total` includes the sum of `amounts` from `buyERC1155`.
