  
No, the `sale` variable is not dependent on `_ price` because it is calculated using the current value of `address (this) .balances` and `total Supply ()` instead of `_ Price`.

The `buynftfeeeth`, `usd_price_sells`, and`usdp_rice_buys` variables are also not directly dependent because they do not change during the execution of the contract.
