  
No, the `_ token  ` variable in function `skim` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and it can't be modified by any external user or function.

The variable is assigned the value of `token ​​0`, which is a public variable defined at the contract level, and its value is set in `constructor` function, so it cannot be changed by external users.
