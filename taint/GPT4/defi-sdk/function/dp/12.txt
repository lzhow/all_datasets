Label: no

Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `depositEth` is an input parameter that is used to call the `deposit` function of the `IWETH9` contract. It is not influenced by any external state or variables outside of the `depositEth` function scope. On the other hand, the variable `amountsOut` in the function `getAmountsOut` is a local variable that is initialized and calculated within the scope of `getAmountsOut`. It is dependent on the input parameter `amountIn`, the `pairs` array, and the `directions` array, but there is no direct or indirect connection between `amount` and `amountsOut`. Since `depositEth` and `getAmountsOut` are separate functions and there is no shared state or data flow between the `amount` and `amountsOut` variables, they are not data dependent.
