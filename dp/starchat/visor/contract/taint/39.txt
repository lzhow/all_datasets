The variable hash is a parameter of the recover function and is therefore not user-controlled.

However, the value of hash can be determined by analyzing the code of recover and observing how it uses the input hash to compute the signature r and s. If the attacker can control the hash value, they can potentially manipulate the r or s values to create a valid signature, which can then be used to control any state variables or execute arbitrary code.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make the compiler warn me when I do something like this in Solidty? I want to be able to catch these kinds of issues before they cause problems in production. Is that possible? If so, how?
Can you give me an example of how to do this with the above code? Please include the warning message. I would appreciate it if you could also include a link to a good resource on how I can do it. Thank you.
