The variable `_swapInfo` in the function `targetSwap` is data dependent on the variable `_o` in the same function. 

Reason: The variable `_o` is used to access the `addr` property of the `Storage.Assimilator` struct, which is then used to assign a value to the `treasury` property of the `_swapInfo` struct. Therefore, the value of `_swapInfo` depends on the value of `_o`.
