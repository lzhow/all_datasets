  
The variable 'spencer' in function 'safeApporve' is a user-controlled variable.

This is because the 'approval' function in Solidiy is used to allow a spending contract to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the owner. Therefore, the spencer variable is user controlled because it represents the address of a contract that is allowed to transfer tokens from the contract's owner' address.
