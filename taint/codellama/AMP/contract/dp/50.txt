  
No, the variables ` index` and `_ operator` are independent.

The variable index is a local variable in function  `_remove PartitionsFrom TotalPartitons` that is used to store the index of the partition in array `_total Partiton`. The variable is not dependent on any other variable or function in this contract.  On the other hand, variable  _ operator is an argument in  function` _ callPost Transfer Hooks` which is passed from the caller of this function. This variable represents the address of an operator who is authorized to perform the transfer. However, this variable does not affect the value of variable` index`.
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is no.
