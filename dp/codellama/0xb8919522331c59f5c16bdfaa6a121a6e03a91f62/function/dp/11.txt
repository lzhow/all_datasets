  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_setImplentation` function, the `StorageSlo.value` is set to ` new Implementation`. This means that the value of ` Storage Slot` will be set as `New Implemenation`.
And in `_Upgrade To And Call` Function, ` _Set Implentation ` is called. This function sets the implementation slot to the new implemntation.
So, in this case, newimplemetation in _ set implementation function is data-dependent on newimplementation in upgrade to and call function.
