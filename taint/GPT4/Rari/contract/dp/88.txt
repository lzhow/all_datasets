The variable `deltaBlocks` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is data dependent on the variable `cToken` in the function `claimRewards`. The reason for this is that `deltaBlocks` is calculated based on the `supplyState.block`, which is updated in the `updateCompSupplyIndex` function. The `supplyState` itself is a storage reference to `compSupplyState[cToken]`, where `cToken` is the key to the mapping. This means that the `supplyState` (and therefore `deltaBlocks`) is directly related to the specific `cToken` that is passed to the `updateCompSupplyIndex` function.

In the `claimRewards` function, the `cToken` variable is used in a loop to call `updateCompSupplyIndex` for each `CToken` in the `cTokens` array. This establishes a data dependency because the value of `deltaBlocks` in `updateCompSupplyIndex` is influenced by which `cToken` is passed to it from `claimRewards`.
