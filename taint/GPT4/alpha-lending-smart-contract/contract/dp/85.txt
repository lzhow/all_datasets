Label: no

Reason: The contract state `reservePercent` is not present in the provided Solidity code. The function `setPool` sets the values of `totalBorrows`, `totalBorrowShares`, and `lastUpdateTimestamp` for a pool associated with a given ERC20 token. Since `reservePercent` is not mentioned or modified in the `setPool` function or anywhere else in the provided code snippet, there is no data dependency relationship between `reservePercent` and `_totalBorrows`. Therefore, the label is 'no'.
