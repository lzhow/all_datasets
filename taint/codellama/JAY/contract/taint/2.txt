  
No, the `_ symbol` variable in this function is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a constant value that is defined in a different contract.

The `_token` contract is an ER2O contract that has a `_name` and `_symbo`l variables that are defined by its constructor. These variables are not user-controlled, they are set by whoever deploys the contract and cannot be changed by any user action.
