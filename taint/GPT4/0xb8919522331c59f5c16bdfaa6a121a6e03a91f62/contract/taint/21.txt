Reason: The variable `data` in the function `upgradeToAndCall` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function is external and does not have any restrictions on who can call it within the provided code snippet, any user can call this function and provide the `data` argument, thus controlling its value. The function's behavior will change based on the `data` that the user sends with the transaction.
