No. The variable `supplyTokens` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `cToken` in the function `flywheelPreTransferAction`. 

The reason is that the variable `supplyTokens` is calculated based on the `cToken` parameter passed to the `updateCompSupplyIndex` function, and it is not used or modified in the `flywheelPreTransferAction` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
