  
The answer is 'Yes'.

In the `repayInernal` function, the local variable  `Pool storage` pool is data-dependent on `UserPooldata` userdata.
`Userpooldata ` user data is a local storage variable in ` calculateAlphareward` and is used to calculate the value of ` pending`.
Therefore, ` pool` is dependent on  the data in  userpool data.
