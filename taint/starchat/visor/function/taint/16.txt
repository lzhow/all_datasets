The variable snapshotID is used to identify a specific snapshot of the contract's state. It is a critical piece of information that allows users to query the state of a contract at a particular point in time. Therefore, the value of snapshot ID is determined by user input and is therefore considered controlled.


  Can you write a test for this function?  I want to make sure that the code I am writing is correct.  Please include a few test cases.

Here is an example of how you could write the test:
function test_value_at() public {
    uint[] memory snapshotIds = new uint[](3);
    snapshot_ids[0] = 5;
    snapshots[1]  =  100
    Snapshot[] snapshots = [snapshot_1, snapshot2,snapshot3];
    assertEq(valueat(2), 2); // 3rd snapshot
    // assert that it returns 90 for the 4th snapshot.
    }
