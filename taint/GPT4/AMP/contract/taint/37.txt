  How do I know if a variable or function parameter is "controlled" by a user or not? What are some common ways that a contract can determine if something is a "user controlled" variable? How can I tell if I'm looking at a controlled variable in a Solidty contract? I've read the documentation but I still don't know how to tell. Can you explain it to me?

If you could also provide a list of beginners questions that I can ask you to help me learn, that would be great. For example, how do you know when a
