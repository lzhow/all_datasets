Reason: The `absoluteTokenAmount` variable in the `hash` function is of type `AbsoluteTokenAmount`, which is a memory struct passed into the function. Since it is a parameter of a public or external function, it can be supplied by the user when they call the function. In Solidity, the `memory` keyword indicates that the variable is a temporary value that is not stored on the blockchain, and it is passed by value, meaning that the caller specifies the data when the function is called. Therefore, the `absoluteTokenAmount` variable is controlled by the user.
