The contract variable ` totalSuppliesByParition ` is not dependent on `_ value` because it is used to store the total supply of a specific partition, and the `_ mint` function only updates the ` _ total Supply` variable.  The `defaultPartitions` and `partition` variables are also not related to `_total Supplies` or `_values`.
