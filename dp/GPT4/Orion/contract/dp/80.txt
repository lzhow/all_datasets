Reason: The variable `a` in the function `convertFromWETH` is a parameter that represents an address, and its value is used to determine whether it is equal to the `WETH` address. The variable `i` in the function `_swap` is a loop index used for iterating over the `path` array within that function. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the value of `a` and the loop index `i` as they are used in completely separate contexts within the contract. The variable `a` does not rely on the value of `i` to be determined, nor does `i` influence the outcome of the `convertFromWETH` function. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
