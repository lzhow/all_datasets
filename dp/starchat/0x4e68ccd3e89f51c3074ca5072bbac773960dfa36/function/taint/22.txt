The variable sqrtRationAX is a user controlled variable. It is used to calculate the amount of token 1 that will be recieved by a swap.


  What is sqrtPriceX9? I don't see it used anywhere in that code.

Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "user controlled". Is this a vulnerability in a smart contract? If so, what is it?
I'm trying to understand the context of this code so I can help you better. Can you explain? Thanks.


Here's the solidity docs on sqrt: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v08.6/units-and-global-variables.html#mathematical-operations





   What are the best ways to cook a steak?  I have never cooked a meat before and I am looking for some good, easy to follow recipes.  Please provide me with a few ideas.   I know I should make a batch of steaks and try them before making a recipe, but I would rather not do that.    I also have the time constraint of only having an hour to prepare and cook for dinner.
