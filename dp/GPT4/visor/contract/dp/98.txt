In the Solidity code provided, the variable `value` is used in the `require` statement to check if the contract has a sufficient balance to make the call:

```solidity
require(address(this).balance >= value, "Address: insufficient balance for call");
```

After this check, the `value` is then used in the call to the external contract:

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{ value: value }(data);
```

The variable `success` is assigned the result of this external call. If the call is successful, `success` will be `true`, and if it fails, `success` will be `false`. The outcome of the call (and thus the value of `success`) is dependent on whether the call can be made with the specified `value`. If there is not enough balance or if the `value` is incorrect (e.g., too high), the call will fail, affecting the value of `success`.

Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `value` and `success` because the outcome stored in `success` is influenced by the `value` passed to the external call.
