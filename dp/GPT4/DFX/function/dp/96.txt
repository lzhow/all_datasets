Explanation: 
Based on the provided code snippet, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `_oBals` in the function `calculateTrade` and the variable `_nHalt` in the function `enforceHalts`. The variable `_oBals` is used in the `calculateTrade` function to update its value, while the variable `_nHalt` is used in the `enforceHalts` function for comparison purposes. Without further information about the relationship between these variables in the broader context of the code, it is not possible to determine if they have a data dependency relationship.
