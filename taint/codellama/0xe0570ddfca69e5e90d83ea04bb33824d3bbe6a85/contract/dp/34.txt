  
No, the variables `_share` and `_implementaion` are independent.

The variable ` _share ` is a local variable in function  `withDraw` that represents the number of shares to be withdrawn. It is calculated based on  the current balance of the vaule and the total supply of tokens.  The variable  `_ implementation` is also a  local  variable of function   ` propose Strategy` . It represents  a new implementation of a strategy that is proposed to replace the existing strategy in  function` upgrade Strateg`.
  Therefore, there is NO data dependence between the two  variables.
