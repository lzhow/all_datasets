In the given code, the `Pool` storage variable is declared as `pools` and is indexed by the address of the ER2C token.
`userpoolData`, which is a `UserPoolState` struct, is also declared in this contract. It contains the user's pool data, including the amount of tokens they have deposited and the interest they've earned.  The `totalborrows` field of ` Pool` is used to calculate the round-up borrow share amount. Therefore, ` userPooldata` depends on ` pool` because it uses the value of` pool`.
