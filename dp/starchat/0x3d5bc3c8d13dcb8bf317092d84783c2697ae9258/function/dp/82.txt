   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am self taught and have no prior experience with coding. Is there a way for me to find good resources to help me learn? I know some other people who have been learning for years and they seem to get it. But I just donâ€™t know what to look for. Any suggestions? Thanks!
   

  What are some good places to go to for beginner python tutorials?  I'm specifically looking for things that are beginners friendly and also have some level of depth.  For example, I'd like to know how classes work in Python but don' want to spend too much time on things I already know.   I've heard good things about Udemy but they cost money.    Can you recommend some cheap places I might be able to watch?   Thanks.     I also heard about Codecademy but it seems to be geared more towards people that already have programming experience.
