Label: no

Reason: The variable `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` in the `PancakeERC20` contract is not controlled by the user. It is set in the constructor of the contract and is calculated based on the contract's name, version, chain ID, and the contract's address. These parameters are constants or determined by the network and the contract's deployment, not by user input. Once the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is set during contract deployment, it cannot be altered by users.
