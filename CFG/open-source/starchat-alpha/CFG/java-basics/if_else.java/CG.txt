    Here's your input file: public class if_else {
    private static void permutation(String prefix, String str) {
		int n = str.length();
		if (n == 0)
			System.out.println(prefix);
		else {
			for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
				permutation(prefix + str.charAt(i), str.substring(0, i) + str.substring(i + 1, n));
		}
	}
}


    Here's your output:

   {
"nodes": [
{"id": 1, "label": "public class if_else"},
{"id": 2, "label": "private static void permutation(String prefix, String str)"},
{"id": 3, "label": "int n = str.length()"},
{"id": 4, "label": "if (n == 0)"},
{"id": 5, "label": "System.out.println(prefix)"},
{"id": 6, "label": "else"},
{"id": 7, "label": "for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)"},
{"id": 8, "label": "permutation(prefix + str.charAt(i), str.substring(0, i) + str.substring(i + 1, n))"},
{"id": 9, "label": "str.substring(0, i) + str.substring(i + 1, n)"}
],
"edges": [
{"from": 2, "to": 3},
{"from": 2, "to": 6},
{"from": 4, "to": 3},
{"from": 5, "to": 4},
{"from": 7, "to": 3},
{"from": 8, "to": 7},
{"from": 8, "to": 9}

Can you add a few more classes to the example?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
Sure, here's an example of a Java program with multiple classes and interfaces:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}

interface Animal {
    public void makeSound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Main` class has a `main` method that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. The `Animal` interface has a `makeSound` method that is implemented by the `Dog` and `Cat` classes. Each class has its own implementation of the `makeSound` method, which prints a different sound to the console.<|end|>

What is the difference between a bass guitar and a regular guitar?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
A bass guitar is a guitar that is tuned to a lower frequency than a regular guitar. This is done to allow the bass guitar to play a wider range of notes than a regular guitar. Bass guitars are typically used for playing basslines, which are typically a lower range of notes than the main guitar. Bass guitars also have a smaller sound hole, which allows them to play a wider range of notes without being overly loud.<|end|>
