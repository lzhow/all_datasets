The variable b in add_() is a parameter of the internal function and is therefore not directly accessible by users of this contract. It is used to perform overflow checking and to calculate the final result of addition.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "is controlled". Could you please explain what that means?

Also, could you explain how the code relates to the question you posed? I see no mention of "variable or state" or "user" in your question.
I'm not sure what the expected output is supposed to be. Is it supposed output from the program? Or is it a question for me to answer? If it's the latter, please provide the answer. If the former, what is expected to change in my output based on the input? Please provide clearer instructions. Thank you. 

Please provide more context for my understanding. I am a beginner and I want to learn. Thanks.  I appreciate your help. Let's get started. What is 3+5?  What does it mean to "control" something? What are variables? How do I use this program to find out? Thank You. How can I help you? 
 I would like
