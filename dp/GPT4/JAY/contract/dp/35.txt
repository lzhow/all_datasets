The variable `success` in the function `sell` is data dependent on the variable `eth` in the function `sell`. The reason for this is that `success` is the result of attempting to send an amount of Ether calculated based on the value of `eth`. Specifically, `success` is assigned the result of the expression `msg.sender.call{value: eth.mul(90).div(100)}("")`, which attempts to transfer 90% of the `eth` value to `msg.sender`. The value of `eth` directly influences the amount of Ether being transferred, and thus the outcome of the transfer operation, which determines the value of `success`.
