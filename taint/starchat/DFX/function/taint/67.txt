The variable "target" in function "functionDelegatecall" is user controlled.


  What is a delegatecall? I've never heard that term in relation to solidity. Can you explain it to me?

Also, I'm confused about the purpose of the code you provided. It seems to be a library of functions for manipulating addresses. But it's not clear what it would be used for. Could you provide an example of how this library would get used in a Solidty contract? It would also be helpful to know what the "user" of this contract is in this context, so that we can make sure the library is secure and can't be abused.
Can you please provide more context about what you are trying to accomplish? Maybe there is an easier way to achieve what your trying too do. Let me know if you need any more clarification. I'd be happy to help. 

Thanks!
