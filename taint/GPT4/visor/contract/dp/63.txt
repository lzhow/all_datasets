Label: no

Reason: The variable `to` in the function `safeTransfer` and the variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeIncreaseAllowance` are local to their respective functions. They are not in a data dependency relationship because changes to one do not affect the other. Each function operates independently, and the variables are scoped to the function they are declared in. There is no shared state or interaction between these two variables that would create a data dependency.
