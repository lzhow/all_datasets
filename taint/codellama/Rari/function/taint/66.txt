The variable `b` in function `sub_` is a function parameter, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user of the contract. However, the value of `a` can also be influenced by other factors, such as the state of other variables in contract storage or the result of previous operations. Therefore, we cannot say for certain that `x` or `y` are controlled solely by user input.
