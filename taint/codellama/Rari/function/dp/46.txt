  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `divScalerByexp` function, the local variable 'numeratior' is calculated by calling the 'mulUint' function with the arguments 'expScales' (a constant) and `scalar` (an input parameter). The `expSclaes` is a constant, so it is not dependent on any other variable. However, `sclaar`, which is an input paramter, is dependent of the input variable of ` mulexp`. Therefore, ' numeratir' in ` divscalerbyexp'is data-dependent on 'a'in ' mul exp'.
