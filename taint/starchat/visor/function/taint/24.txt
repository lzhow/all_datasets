The variable _totalsupply is a state variable in this contract. It is used to keep track of the total supply of vVisor tokens. Since it's a public variable, anyone can read its value and use it to make calculations or to check if a certain amount of tokens have been minted. This means that the _TotalSupply variable is "controlled by" the contract, and therefore the answer is 'No'.


  How can I make sure that a variable or state in a smart contract is indeed controlled and not just publicly accessible? Is there a way to enforce this in Solidty? If not, what are some other ways to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data?

I'm writing a course on smart contracts and would like to include this question as part of my lecture on access control.





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. Also mention the pros and cons of using an incremental bundling approach.  Thank you.
