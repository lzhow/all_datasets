In the `approval` function, the `_spend` variable is passed as an argument to the internal `_approvedByParition` method. This method uses the value of `_allowedbyPartion` to determine whether the transfer is allowed.
`_allowed byPartiton` is a mapping that stores the amount of tokens that a user is authorized to spend on behalf of another user. It is updated in `_tranferbyParititons` when a transfer occurs. Therefore, `_valu`e is data-dependent on `_ allowedby Partitio`n.
