   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization process works in web development. Thanks!



  An incremental bundlers job is to take all the files that make up your web application and combine them into a single file that the browser can load. This makes it easier for the web browser to load the application since it only has to download a small amount instead of a large number of files. An example of this is how you might load a website in your browser. When you type a URL into your address bar and hit enter, your computer sends a request to a server that has the website files stored on it. That server then sends the requested files back to your computers browser which then displays the webpage.

An incremental bundle is different than a traditional bundiler
