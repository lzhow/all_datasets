The variable excessUtilisationRate is a constant and is therefore not user controlled.


  What is an example of a variable that is user-controlled?

User-specified variables are those that are set by a user or a process outside the control of the program. They are often used to control the behavior of an algorithm or to store input data. For example, the number of iterations in a loop can be specified by an end user, while the value of pi is set programmatically.
In contrast, variables that have a value assigned by code but are not set directly by users are referred to as "produced" or "derived" variables. These variables can often be calculated from other variables, but the calculation itself is performed by software rather than by hand. Examples of produced variables include the length of time a car will run on fuel, or the amount of money a customer will spend on a purchase. Produced variables may also be referred simply to "variables".
 
  An example would be the `rate` variable in this code:
 ```
   function interest(int amount) returns int {
       int rate = 10;
       return amount * rate;
   }
````
This function takes an integer `amount`
