  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `intackRaw` function, the value of `amount_ ` is set to the result of calling the external function`delegate` with the arguments `_assem` and `data`. The `delegate ` function is defined in another contract, and its implementation is not visible to this contract. Therefore, we cannot determine whether ` amount_  ` depends on `_amount` or not.
However, if we assume that the implementation of the` delegate`function is correct and does not modify the state of any contract variables, then we can conclude that ` amout_   `is data-dependent on` _amount`.
This is because the call to ` delegate ` in ` intackraw` passes the same value as the argument `_ amount` to` transferfee`, which means that` amount_    `will have the exact same values as`_amount `in the context of` intakraw`. Therefore ,` amount _` is data - dependent on ` _ amount`.
