  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `bytes4` variable named `frompartitionPrefix` is assigned the value of the `_getpartitionprefix` function. This function takes the input `_ frompartition` and returns a ` bytes 4 ` value.
Then, in line 10, `if (_ ispartitionstrategy[ from partitionprefix])` checks if the array `_ispartitionStrategy` has a value at the index ` frompartitionsPrefix`.
If the condition is true, then the address of `IAmppartitionStrategValidator` interface is stored in `FrompartitionValidatorimplementation`. This interface has the method `tokesfrompartitontovalidate`. The method takes in `_sig`, `_Frompartion`,`_operator`, and `_value` as inputs.  The ` _sig` value is obtained from the message signature. `_operator`is the operator address. `msg. sig` returns the signature of a message. It is a  bytes value that is used to identify the sender of an Ethereum transaction. In the second function `interfaceAddrr` takes `_to`and `AMP_token_sender`as inputs and assigns the return value to ` senderimplementation`
`senderimplementation ` is then used in a conditional statement to check if it is not equal to zero. If the conditional is met, it calls the`toketostransfer` method of`IAMPtokenSender`interface. Then, if `_ isPartitonstrategy [from partition prefix]` is `true`, the same process is repeated. However, this time,`from PartitioValidatorimplementaion` stores the interface address instead of `_senderimplemenation`.  In both cases, `_data` , `_ operatordata`, ` msg .sig `, and ` Frompartition ` are passed as arguments to the methods. Therefore, these variables are dependent on `_ Frompartition`.
