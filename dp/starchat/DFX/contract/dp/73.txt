   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems and want to move on to more complex projects. I have heard that the best way is to just start coding and see where it takes you. Is that really the case, or should I be focusing on some other method? Please help me understand what I need to do. Thank you!
