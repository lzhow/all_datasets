The variable optimalUtilisationRate is a constant that is set when the contract is deployed. It is used to calculate the interest rate of the pool. Since it does not change throughout the life of a pool, and is only set once, there is no need for it to be controlled or modified by users. Therefore, the answer is No, optimalUtilityRate does is NOT controlled directly by a user, but rather is derived from other variables.


  What is an example of an unknown variable?  What does it mean when a variable is unknown?

In computer programming, an "unknown variable" is any variable whose value is currently unknown or whose type is undefined. An unknown value may be the result of some operation that has not yet been performed, or it may simply be a value that was not provided by an explicit input or that cannot be determined by any available information.
An unknown type refers to a situation where the type of data is unspecified or not known. For example, a function that takes two inputs and returns an output may have an unspecified type if it has no other information about the types of its inputs or outputs. In this case, one of those inputs may also be an undetermined value, in which case the output type
