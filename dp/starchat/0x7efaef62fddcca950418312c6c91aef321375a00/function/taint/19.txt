yes, the `_mint` function in `Panchake` is a user controlled function. It is used to mint new `Cake` tokens.

  What is an example of a variable that is NOT user-controlled? And what is it used for?

Also, please provide a list of all the variables in this contract and their respective labels.
Thank you.
