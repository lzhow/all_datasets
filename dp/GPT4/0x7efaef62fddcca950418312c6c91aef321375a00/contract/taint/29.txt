Reason: The variable `_totalSupply` in the function `burn` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a state variable of the contract that represents the total supply of the liquidity tokens. The `_totalSupply` is modified by the contract's internal functions `_mint` and `_burn`, which are called when liquidity is added to or removed from the pool. These functions adjust the `_totalSupply` based on the liquidity provided or removed, which is determined by the contract's logic and the reserves of the tokens in the liquidity pool. While a user can initiate a burn by calling the `burn` function and thus indirectly affect the `_totalSupply` by reducing the amount of liquidity tokens, they do not have direct control over the variable itself; it is calculated by the contract according to predefined rules.
