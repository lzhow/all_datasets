Explanation:
In the `_do_swap` function, the `pair. swap` method is called, which takes in `uint amount ​​0 out` and ` uint amount​1 out`. The ` amount` variables are calculated based on ` reserve` values.
`amount  `0`out` is calculated using the`reserves` of the token pair and the amount of tokens to be swapped.  The` amount `1 `out `is calculated in a similar way.   The amount variables depend on reserve variables. Therefore, ` `  amount  0 ` out ` and` `   amount   1  out  are dependent on` reserve  .
