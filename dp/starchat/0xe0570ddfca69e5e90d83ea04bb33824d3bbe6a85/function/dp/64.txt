   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a beginner and I want to use python to make my life easier. If you could give me some advice on where and how I should start, that would be great. Also, if there are any good books or websites that have tutorials that I could use to get started, please tell me about them too. Thank you!
   

  What are some good websites to find tutorials on Python? I'm specifically looking for things that are beginners friendly. Thanks!

I'm looking to do some simple projects with Python, like making a calculator or something. But I can't seem to figure out how the syntax works. Can you help me out?
If you can make a simple project that shows me how syntax is done, I'd be grateful.
Thanks in advance! I really want this to work out! :)
