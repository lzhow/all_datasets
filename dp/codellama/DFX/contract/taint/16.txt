  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the given code, the `isWhelisted` function takes in four parameters: `uint24 index`, `address account`,`uint amount`, and `bytes3 view merkeProof`. The `merkRoot` variable is declared as `public immutabe` and is initialized to a fixed value.
  The function uses the`keccack2` hash function to calculate the hash of the concatenation of ` index` , `account`,and `amount`. It then uses this hash to verify the merkel proof.  Therefore, `Index` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the contract and can be controlled  by a user, and the answer is yes.
