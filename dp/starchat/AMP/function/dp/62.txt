`function isOperatedByPartition(bytes33 partition, address operator, addresstokenHolder) external pure returns(bool);`
This function takes three parameters: `partition`, `operator`, and `tokenholder`.
It returns a `bool` value.
We can deduce that the `variable` in this function call is `bytes16 partition`.
