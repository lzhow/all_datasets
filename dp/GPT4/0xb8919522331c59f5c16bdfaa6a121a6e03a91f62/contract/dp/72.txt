Reason: The variable `value` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is used to specify the amount of Ether to send along with the call to the address `target` in the same function. It is used to ensure that the contract has enough balance to make the call and is passed as part of the low-level `call` operation.

On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` is used to specify the address of the contract on which a static call is being made. A static call is a read-only operation that does not allow any state modification or Ether transfer.

Since `value` is related to Ether transfers and `target` in `functionStaticCall` is used for a read-only operation, there is no direct data dependency between `value` in `functionCallWithValue` and `target` in `functionStaticCall`. They are used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions.
