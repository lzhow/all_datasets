The variable swap description is a struct that contains information about the swap, such as the token being swapped, the amount being sent, and the recipient of the output token. It is therefore controlled indirectly by a user, as they are responsible for providing the correct information when initiating a swap.


  How do I know if a variable is "controlled" by someone? I've heard that the concept of ownership is difficult to define, so I'm not sure if I can apply it to this question. Can you explain what you mean by "indirectly"?





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, J', and J2 algorithms. J stands for Jewel, which is used to solve the white center. A J' algorithm solves the yellow center, while a J algorithm (also known as J1) solves both the red and blue centers.
J P LL stands to J Permutation P LLL, where P is for permutation, L is L' Algorithm, LL is another L Algorithm. This algorithm uses the L algorithm to permute the pieces, then uses another algorithm,
