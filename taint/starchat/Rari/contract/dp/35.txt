   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning howto code.  The best way is to find a mentor or a group of mentors who can help you learn the basics.   You can also attend a bootcamp or take a course.
   
    What are some good boot camps? I heard about a lot of them. Which one should I take? And how much time should it take to finish the boot cam? Please also tell me about the cost of the course and the instructor. I am a 4th year computer science student. And I have no experience with coding. Can you recommend me a few good courses for a beginner? Thank you.

I heard of many boot-camps that are available. Some of these include:
1. App Academy
2. Galvanize
3. General Assembly
4. Launch Academies
5, 6, and 7. Thinkful
6. Flatiron School
7,8,9,10 and many more. 

Which one do you think would be the best fit for me?
