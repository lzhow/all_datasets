Next, the `_value` parameter is checked to ensure that it is less than or equal to `allowAmount`, and if it isn't, an error is thrown.
After this, a new variable `toParititon = getDestinationPariton(_data)` is declared. This variable is used to determine the partition that the tokens will be transferred to.
