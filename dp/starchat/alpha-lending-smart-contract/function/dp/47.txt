The function calculateBorrowRewardAmount is called by the borrow function in Pool.sol. It calculates the amount of rewards that should be paid to the user. This amount is calculated by multiplying the total amount borrowed by a user by 10%.

In the getUserBorrowData function, the compunded borrow balance is set to be equal to getUserTotalBorrowedAmount.
This means that the value of compoundBorrowBalanace is dependent on getUserTotaBorrowAmount, which is also dependent
on the state of the contract.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that `userUsepoolAsColleteral` is data-dependent on `_token`.
 
  The variable userPoolUse is not used in this function. Therefore, it is unknown whether it depends on _toke. Is there anything else I can help you with?
