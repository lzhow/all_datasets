Label: no

Reason: The variable `a` in the function `mulScalarTruncate` and the variable `errorMessage` in the function `safe224` are in two separate functions that do not call each other, nor do they share any state variables or inputs that would create a data dependency between them. Each function operates independently, and there is no flow of data from `errorMessage` to `a` or vice versa within the given code snippet. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
