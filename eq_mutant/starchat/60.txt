No, these are different codes. In the first code, `i` decrements from `0` to `length-1` each loop, while in the second code it increments from  `1 to length-2`, hence the inner `for` loop never runs. 

In addition, in `j`, the outer `while` statement checks whether `data.lenght` has been reached, but in this mutated code `lengh` does not change in each iteration, so the condition never becomes false and the loop will run forever.
