Reason: The variable `protocolFeeAmount` in the `execute` function is not directly controlled by the user. It is calculated internally within the `getReturnedAmounts` function based on the `protocolFee` structure provided in the `swapDescription` and the `outputBalanceChange` which is the result of the swap operation. The `protocolFee` structure itself may contain parameters that are predefined by the contract or set by the contract owner (as indicated by the `validateProtocolFeeSignature` function which checks against a default protocol fee and a signature for any deviations). While a user may influence the `outputBalanceChange` indirectly through the swap operation, the calculation of `protocolFeeAmount` is governed by the contract logic and the predefined fee structure, not by direct user input or control.
