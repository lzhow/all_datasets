The contract variable token1 is not directly data-dependent on feeon in this function. However, it is possible for token0 and token 1 to be data dependencies of fee on. For example, if token is a mapping or array that is updated in some other function, then it could be possible that feeON is data dependendent on that mapping.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependency". Could you explain it to me?
  
  Data dependency is when one variable or value depends on another variable. In the context of Solidty, data depends when the value of one contract or state variable depends upon the state of another contract. This can be a complex relationship that can't be determined statically.

In the example you provided, the data that depends is token. If token changes, fee ON will also change. But, token can also be updated by other functions, and those changes can affect fee On. So, in order to determine if fee is dependent on token, you need to look at all the code that affects token and fee. 

This is why it's important to have good documentation and testing to ensure that all data is properly updated and that the
