The variable `absoluteInputAmount` in the function `execute` is data dependent on the variable `tokenAmount` in the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount`. The reason for this is that `absoluteInputAmount` is assigned the return value of the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount`, which takes `tokenAmount` as one of its parameters. The `getAbsoluteInputAmount` function uses the `tokenAmount` parameter to determine the `absoluteTokenAmount` based on the `amountType` and other conditions. Therefore, any changes to `tokenAmount` will affect the computation and the resulting value of `absoluteInputAmount`.
