No. The variable `borrower` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp` is not data dependent on the variable `holder` in the function `claimRewards`. 

The function `distributeBorrowerComp` takes the `borrower` as an argument and does not use or modify the `holder` variable. Similarly, the function `claimRewards` takes the `holder` as an argument and does not use or modify the `borrower` variable. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
