Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `proof` in the function `multiProofVerify` is passed as a memory parameter. Since it is a memory parameter, it is not directly controlled by the user. However, without further context, it is not possible to determine if the values of `proof` are controlled by the user indirectly through other user-controlled variables or inputs. Therefore, the label for the variable `proof` is "unknown".
