  
No, the ` old pending Admin` variable in function `_accept Admin()` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created when the `_set pendingadmin()` function is called.

The ` _ accept Admin() ` function sets the pending administrator to be the current pending  administrator, and the old administrator is set to  be  the previous pending Administrator.  The `newPedingAdmin ` variable is also created in this function, which is assigned the address of the new pending   administrator.   The  `admin` and `pendingadmin ` variables are also updated in  this  function.
