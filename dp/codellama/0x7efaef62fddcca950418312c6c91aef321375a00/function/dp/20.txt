  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getReserve` function, the `_reverve0`, `_reverse1`, and `_blockTimestamplast` variables are assigned values from the corresponding state variables `reserver0 `, ` reservere1 ` and `blockTimeStampLast`.
These state variable are updated in a separate function called `_update` which is called in ` swap` after the balances of the tokens are calculated.
Therefore, `_ reserve 1` is data-dependent on ` balance 2` because it is updated by the same function that updates ` balanace 3`.
