  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `functioCall` function, the parameter `bytes` is passed as an argument to the internal function `_verifycallResult`. The `_verifcallresult` internal functions checks if the call was successful and returns the data if it was.
Since the `_ verifycall result` functions is called with the argument `retuendata` which is a `byte` array, it is data-dependent on ` retuenda` variable. Therefore, ` data` and ` value` are dependent on each other.
