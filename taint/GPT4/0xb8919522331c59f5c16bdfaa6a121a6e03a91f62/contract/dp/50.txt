Reason: In the Solidity contract code provided, within the `functionDelegateCall` function, the variable `data` is used as an argument in the `delegatecall` to the address specified by the variable `target`. The `delegatecall` is a low-level function call that executes the code at the target address with the provided input data (`data`) in the context of the calling contract. This means that the execution of `delegatecall` depends on both the `target` address and the `data` being passed to it. The `target` determines which contract's code will be executed, and `data` represents the encoded function call and its parameters to be executed on the `target` contract. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `data` and `target` because the outcome of the `delegatecall` is influenced by both variables.
