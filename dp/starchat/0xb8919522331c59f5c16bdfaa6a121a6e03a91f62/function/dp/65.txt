The variables `target`, `data`, and `errorMessage` are all function parameters and are therefore not directly involved in any data dependencies. However, the `delegateCall` method of the address type can modify the state of a contract, so it is possible that the value of `success` or `retundata `depends on these variables. Therefore, it can be difficult to determine whether or not these two parameters have any direct data dependence.


  Can you give me a shortened version of this code?
 
  ```
  function f(address a, string s) internal {
    a.call("");
    s.length;
  }
  // is a dependent on s? yes/no/unknown
  yes

  ```
  
 
   
    What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to understand if I should use it in my project. Thanks!

    
    An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can then be served to the user
