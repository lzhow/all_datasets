Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_operator` in the function `_isOperator` and the variable `_operator` in the function `_isOperatorForPartition` are both parameters passed to these functions when they are called. They represent the address of the entity trying to operate on behalf of another address (the `_tokenHolder`). In the context of the function `_isOperatorForPartition`, it checks if the `_operator` is authorized to operate for a specific partition of the `_tokenHolder`'s tokens. This function internally calls `_isOperator`, passing the `_operator` variable to it, to check if the `_operator` is authorized to operate on behalf of the `_tokenHolder` in general.

Since the `_operator` in `_isOperatorForPartition` is directly used as an argument in the call to `_isOperator`, there is a clear data dependency between the `_operator` variable in the `_isOperatorForPartition` function and the `_operator` variable in the `_isOperator` function. The outcome of `_isOperator` can affect the control flow and logic within `_isOperatorForPartition`, establishing a data dependency relationship.
