Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `y` in the function `get_y` is not directly controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the input parameters `i`, `j`, `x`, `xp_`, and `amp`. The value of `y` is determined by the logic of the function and the values of the input parameters. Without further context or information about how the input parameters are obtained, it is not possible to determine if the variable `y` is controlled by the user.
