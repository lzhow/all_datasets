In the `getUserPooData` function, the value of `compooundedborroweBalanc` is calculated using the result of the call to the internal function`getuserCompoundLiuidtyBalanace`. This function takes two parameters, `_user` and `_token`, and returns the compound liquidty balance of `_ user` for the token `_ token`.
  The value returned by ` getusercompoundliquidtiybalance ` is used to calculate the current compoounded borrow balance for `_ amount` by adding the amount to it.
Therefore, ` compouondedborrrowbalanc ` depends on `_ amout` because it is derived from the return value from `Getusercompliditibalance`.
