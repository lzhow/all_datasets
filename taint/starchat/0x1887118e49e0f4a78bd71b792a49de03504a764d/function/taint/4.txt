Yes, the `bool public` variable named ` can Admin Overwrite` is a user-controlled parameter in this contract.

The `onlyAdmin` modifier instructs the contract to restrict all function calls to only those made by an address that is stored in a `admin` state variable. This variable is set in its constructor and can only be changed by a call to the` change Admin` function, which requires a transaction to be signed by that address.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it has something to do with inheritance, but I don't know what. Can I ask you for help? If so, please explain what I should be looking for. If not, that's fine too. Just let me know how to read the solidity code. Thanks.  I am new to solidity. 

I'm trying to understand how this code uses inheritance to create a Master Price Oracle. It seems like it's trying make a new contract that inherits from both the Price oracle and the Base Price Oracel. But I can't figure out how it does that. Could you please help me understand?
Can you also explain to me how oracular contracts work? What
