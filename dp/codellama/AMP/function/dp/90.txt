In the `balaceOf` function, the `_balaces` mapping is accessed using the address `_tokneHolder`. This mapping stores the balance of each token holder.
On the other hand, in `_ addTokenTOPartition`function, `_ balances`mapping is also accessed, but this time using `_ to` address. This function adds tokens to the partition of the token owner.  The `_ balance` variable is updated in this function. Therefore, there is a dependency between the two functions.
