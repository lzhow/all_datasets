Yes

The variable `_data` in the constructor of the `ERC1967Proxy` contract is controlled by the user because it is an input parameter to the constructor function. When a contract is deployed, the constructor is called with arguments provided by the user who is deploying the contract. Therefore, the user has control over the value of `_data` that is passed to the constructor at the time of contract deployment.
