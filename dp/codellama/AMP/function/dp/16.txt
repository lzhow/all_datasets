  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `bytes4` variable named `partitionPrefix`, which is a parameter of the `_getParitionStrategValidator` function is used to determine the value of `partitonManagerImplentation`. The `if` statement checks if the partition prefix is equal to the zero prefix, and if it is not, it sets the recipent implementation to be the address of a contract that implements the IAMPartitionManagerValidator interface.
Similarly, in function 2, `address recipienImplemenation` is set to `interfaceAdd(address(msg.sender), AmpTokenRecipiet)`.
Both of these functions are called within the same function and the variables are used in a similar way. Therefore, we can conclude that the two functions have data dependencies.
