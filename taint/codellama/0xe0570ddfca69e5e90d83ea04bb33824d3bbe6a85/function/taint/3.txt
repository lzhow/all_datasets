  
No, the `_poo` variable in function `depost` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the current balance of the contract. It' s not possible for the users to manipulate the value of this variable.

The `_amount` parameter is also not user-controlled because the `wanted.balanaceOf` function returns the balance that belongs to this contract, which is a constant value that cannot be changed by users.
