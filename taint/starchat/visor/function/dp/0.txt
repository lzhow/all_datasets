The function "safeIncreaseAllowances" is not a part of the code provided. Could you please provide the entire code for the contract that includes the "increaseAllownace" function?

pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
import "./IERC1155Receiver.sol";
contract Ierc165 {
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view returns (bool);
}
interface I18N {
  function language() external view  returns(string memory);
  }
  contract I223 is II212, Ii246, II261, iERC729,  II196 {
      function transfer(uint2 value, address to) external;
      }
      contract II98 is II89 {
          function balanceOf(I90 key) view external returns uint;
          }
          contract i99 is i100 {
              function ownerOf (uint tokenId ) view public returns address;
              }
              contract  i288  is  ii274,   iI173,    i
