The contract state `sellNftFeeEth` is data dependent on the variable `_price` in the function `updateFees`. In the `updateFees` function, `_price` is calculated based on the latest round data from the `priceFeed` contract. This `_price` is then used to determine the new value of `sellNftFeeEth` based on the current USD price of selling NFTs (`USD_PRICE_SELL`). The new `sellNftFeeEth` is calculated by comparing `_price` with `USD_PRICE_SELL` and adjusting the fee accordingly. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `_price` and `sellNftFeeEth` within the `updateFees` function.
