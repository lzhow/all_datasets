Label: No

Reason: The variable `proxy` in the function `changeProxyAdmin` of the `ProxyAdmin` contract is a parameter of the function. While it may seem that the user can control it by passing any address as an argument, the function itself is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that only the owner of the `ProxyAdmin` contract can successfully call `changeProxyAdmin`. Since the owner is set upon contract creation and can only be changed by the current owner, the control over which `proxy` can be passed to this function is not arbitrary and is restricted to the owner, not a general user. Therefore, the variable `proxy` in this context is not controlled by the user.
