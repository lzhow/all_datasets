  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `while` loop of the findLowerBound function, the value of `mid` is calculated using the average function from the Math library. This function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their average. In this case, both `middle`and `element` are passed as arguments to the  `averge` function. Therefore,  the values of  both  variables ` middle`   and  variable  element`are data-dependent on each other.
