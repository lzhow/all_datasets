Label: no

Reason: The variable `success` in the function `verifyCallResult` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called. It is not directly dependent on any state variable or other variables outside of its scope. The variable `success` in `verifyCallResult` is used to determine the control flow within that function, but it does not have a data dependency with the variable `value` in the function `functionCallWithValue`.

The variable `value` in `functionCallWithValue` is used to specify the amount of Ether (value) to send with the call to the target address. It is independent of the `success` variable in `verifyCallResult`, which is used to check the success status of a previous call or transaction. The `success` variable in `verifyCallResult` is determined by the outcome of the call or transaction, and it does not rely on the `value` variable for its own value.

Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `value` in `functionCallWithValue` and `success` in `verifyCallResult`.
