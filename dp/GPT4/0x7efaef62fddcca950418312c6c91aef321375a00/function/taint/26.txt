Label: no

Reason: The variable `denominator` in the function `_mintFee` is calculated within the contract's code and does not take any direct input from the user. It is computed using constants and state variables that are not directly manipulable by the user. Specifically, it is calculated using the contract's `totalSupply`, the `rootK` and `rootKLast` values (which are derived from the reserves of the liquidity pool), and fixed constants. The user does not have control over these values in a direct manner; they are determined by the contract's logic and the state of the contract, which is influenced by all interactions with it, not a single user.
