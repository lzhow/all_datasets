Explanation: The variable `_notEntered` is not controlled by the user. It is a state variable defined in the imported contract `CEther.sol` and is inherited by the `CEtherDelegate` contract. The code provided does not show any user input or external interaction that can directly control the value of `_notEntered`. Therefore, it can be classified as not controlled by the user.
