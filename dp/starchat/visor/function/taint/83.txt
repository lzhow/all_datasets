The variable _TYPE\_HASH in this function is used to create a unique identifier for the permit signature. This identifier is then used as part of the EVM call stack to ensure that the signature is valid and has not been tampered with.

As such, the value of this variable is generated by a trusted party, and therefore it can be considered to be "controlled by" the smart contract user, as they are the one who is responsible for generating the signatures.


  Can you explain to me how the DOMAION_SEPERATOR() function works? I know that it's used for creating unique identifiers, but I don't understand how it works exactly. Can I just use the address of my smartcontract as the domain separator? And if not, what else can I use? Can the contract be hacked by just changing the separator to something else? If so, how can this be prevented? Please explain it to my in great detail. I'm struggling to understand this part and I think it would help me a lot if you could explain this to a layman like me. Thank you in advance!
