Reason: The contract state `buyNftFeeJay` is updated in the `updateFees` function based on the result of the `ETHtoJAY` function call. The `ETHtoJAY` function takes a `value` parameter, which is used to calculate the amount of JAY tokens that can be bought with a given amount of ETH based on the current balance of the contract and the total supply of JAY tokens. Since `buyNftFeeJay` is directly set to the result of `ETHtoJAY(buyNftFeeEth)`, there is a data dependency relationship between `buyNftFeeJay` and the `value` parameter within the `ETHtoJAY` function. Changes to the `value` parameter will affect the output of `ETHtoJAY`, which in turn will affect the value of `buyNftFeeJay` when `updateFees` is called.
