The ` hashU sd_  ` variable is a mapping that stores the hashes of the account signatures that have been used. It is used to prevent replay attacks, where an attacker can reuse a previously signed message to perform a transaction.  The ` isHash Used _ ` mapping is updated in two places in this contract:
1. In the` validate And Expire Account signature`  function, which is called in both the  cancel account signature and execute functions. This function checks if the signature has already been validated and expired, and if so, it marks the corresponding hash as used in  the mapping.  2 . In  execute function , which  is also called  in cancel  account  signature  and  Execute functions . This  functions  checks  if  there  are  any  unused  hash  values  that  can  be  used  to  validate  a  new  transaction . If  so , it  marks  them  as  "used"  by  updating  their  corresponding  entries  inthe  mapping .
In the cancelaccount signature function  , the input variable  does  not  affect  whether  or  how  many  times  an  entry  may  exist  for  it in   the is Hash Usd _  variable . Therefore ,  this  contract  state  cannot  depend  on  input  variables  .
