  
The variable `_subtrahend` in function `decreaseAllowenceByParition` is a parameter of the method, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user who calls the contract. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.

In Solidiy, parameters are passed by value, so the value of `_suubtraend ` is copied to the local variable ` _newAllowed` when the ` decreaseAllownceByPArtition ` function starts. This means the `_newAllwed` variable is also controlled  by user, and can potentially be modified by them.
