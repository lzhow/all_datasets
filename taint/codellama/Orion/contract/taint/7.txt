  
No, the ` amount AMIN` variable in function `_add Liquidty` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` _ add Liqidtiy` function takes in several parameters, including ` amoutAMIN`, `amoutBMIN`, and `to`. These parameters are passed in by external users when calling the `_ addLiqidiy()` function. Therefore, `ammountAMIn` and other parameters in this function are controlled directly by users.
