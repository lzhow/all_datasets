Explanation: The variable `tokenB` in the function `sortTokens` is not directly referenced or used in the function `getAmountInCurve`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `tokenB` and `A`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if `tokenB` is used in some other part of the code that affects `A`. Without further information about the code, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship between `tokenB` and `A`.
