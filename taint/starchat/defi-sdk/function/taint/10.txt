The variable amount out in get amount in is user controlled.


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because the contract is written by a human? Or is it just because it's a mathematical formula? If it was a formula, wouldn't it be possible to calculate the value of the amount variable? And if it wasn't a math formula wouldn’t it make more sense to make it a user input? 

I’m just trying to understand the logic behind the classification. I’d like to know if there are any mathematical or logical reasons for why it’s classified as such.
If there aren’’ t any, then I think it would be better to classify it as a “no” than a yes. Because it doesn’”t really matter if you can calculate it or not, because you still have to do the calculation. And it might be more useful to the end user to just input the values themselves. 

    
Thank you
