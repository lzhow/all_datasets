Explanation: The variable `amountOut` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of `userAmountIn` which is calculated based on internal logic and function calls within the `doSwapThroughOrionPool` function. The user does not have direct control over the value assigned to `amountOut`.
