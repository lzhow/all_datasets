The variable admin\_ in function contructor is unknown to the tool. It is a derived state variable that is computed from the initial value of the admin variable. However, the analysis does not track the flow of values through the program, so it cannot determine whether the value is user-controlled or not.


  Can you explain how the code works? I am not very good at coding. I want to understand how it works so I can use it effectively. Can I do that? If not, what are some other ways I could use the information the contract analysis gives me? Can the output of this analysis be used to automatically generate tests? How? Please explain in detail.

I am writing a course on smart contracts and would like to use this tool in my lectures. If you could help me understand the limitations of my tool, that would be great. For example, if it can only tell me if a variable is "user controlled" or "not user controlled", but not how, then I will have to explain that to my students. But if you can explain it in such a way that I would understand, I'd be grateful. 

Thank you for your help. This is very important to me.  I
