   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am currently in high school, and I took AP Computer Science A in 7th grade. Is python easier than languages like Java or C++? What are some good ways to get started with python, if it is indeed easier? I know some people who have taken other computer science classes, so I would like to know if they would recommend python as their first language, or if there are other languages they think would be a better fit. Thank you!
   

  What's the best way for me to become good at coding in Python? Should I just start using it and see where it takes me? Or should I focus on a specific library or framework? Are there any other things I should know about? Please help me! I'm in college and don’t have that much time. Thanks!

I’m thinking of taking a course in it, can you recommend me some?
Also, what IDE should i use? Pycharm? VSCode? Something else? And how do
