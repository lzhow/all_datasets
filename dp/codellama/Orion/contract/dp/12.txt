In the `_do_swap` function, the `amount` variable is calculated using the reserve balances of the tokens in `pair`. The `getreserves` method of `ICurvesPool` is called to get the current reserve amounts of each token in a pool.
`reserver0`, `reverser1`, and `totalSupply` are all calculated from the results of this method. These variables are then used to calculate the amount of tokens that can be exchanged for a given amount.
