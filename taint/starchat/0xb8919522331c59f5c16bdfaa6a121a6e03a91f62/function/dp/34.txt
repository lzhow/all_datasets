The function `_verifycallresult` is a private function that is called by the `staticCall` function. It is used to verify the result of the call and return an error message if the verification fails.

In the first function, the `_verifystaticcall` variable is dependent on `target`, `success`, and `errorMessage`.
`target` and` success` are both variables that are passed into the`_verfifycallResult`function, and they do not change during the execution of`_verifyStaticcall`. Therefore, these two parameters do no affect the value of `_verifiedcall`, so they can be ignored. `ErrorMessage`is a string variable that can change the output of` _verfiycallresut`, but it is not used in any calculations within the` staticCall ` function and can therefore be safely ignored as well. Therefore, the two functions have the same data dependence relationship on these three parameters.


  Can you explain how the tool works in more detail?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain in detail how my tool analyzes Solidty contract codes and classifies data dependencies.

  First, my program analyses the contract's source code to identify all variables and
