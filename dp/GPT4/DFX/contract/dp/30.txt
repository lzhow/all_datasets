Yes, the variable `_swapInfo` in the function `targetSwap` is data dependent on the variable `_t` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `_swapInfo` is assigned the value of `_t.ix` in the line `_swapInfo.curveFactory = ICurveFactory(_swapData._curveFactory);`. This means that the value of `_swapInfo.curveFactory` depends on the value of `_t.ix`, which is a property of the variable `_t`. Therefore, there is a data dependency between `_swapInfo` and `_t`.
