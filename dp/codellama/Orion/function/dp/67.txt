  
The label is 'No'.

In the `function` ` tryadd`, the local variable` c` is defined as the sum of the two input parameters `a` and `b`. The variable is not modified or reassigned within the scope of this function, so it is independent of any other variables in this scope.
On the other hand, the` function` trymul` defines a local` variable c`, which is also the product of two inputs ` a`and ` b`. However, this variable does not depend on any variables defined in ` functiontryadd`.
Therefore, `variable c ` in`functiontryAdd` doesnot depend`variablec `in`funciontrymul`.
