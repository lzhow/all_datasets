The contract state `kLast` is data dependent on the variable `liquidity` in the function `mint`. In the `mint` function, `liquidity` is calculated based on the amounts of token0 and token1 added to the pool, and the current reserves. If the `feeOn` boolean is true, which is determined by the `_mintFee` function, `kLast` is updated at the end of the `mint` function to be the product of the updated reserves `reserve0` and `reserve1`. Since `liquidity` affects the reserves through the `_update` function call, and `kLast` is subsequently set based on the new reserve values, there is a data dependency relationship between `kLast` and `liquidity`.
