Label: No

Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `handleETHInput` is a parameter that is passed when the function is called. It is independent of any other variables outside of its scope. The variable `amount` in the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount` is also a parameter of that function and is scoped only within `getAbsoluteInputAmount`. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the two `amount` variables in these two separate functions as they are parameters that are local to their respective functions. Each function's `amount` variable is populated by the caller of the function and does not rely on the other's value.
