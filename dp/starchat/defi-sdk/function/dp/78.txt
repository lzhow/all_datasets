The contract variable `_entered` is not directly used in `function execute`. However, it is possible that the value of `_Entered` could be changed by a call to `Address.FunctionCall` within the `Function execute`, which could result in a change in program behavior.


  How can I prevent this?
 
  You can add a check to see if the `_Enter` variable has changed before using it. For example:

function myFunction() public {
  bool entered = _Enter;
  // Code that uses entered
  require(enter == _enter, "Cannot change entered state");
}
This will revert the transaction if `_entred` has been changed.
Alternatively, you can use a library that provides thread-safe access to a boolean variable. These libraries can be used to ensure that only one thread can access the boolean at a time, preventing race conditions. However this may incur a performance penalty.


I hope this helps!
