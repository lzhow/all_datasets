  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `targetSwaps` function, the `_swapdata` parameter is passed to the` gettargetswap` data function. This function returns several values, including the value of `_amt`, `_obal`, and `_nbal`. The `_ogliq`, which is a local variable in ` targetswap`, is calculated by adding up the values of all the elements in `_reserve` array, which includes the address of the current contract. Therefore, `_ ogli q` is data-dependent on `_ bal` because it is derived from the balance of a particular asset in a pool.
