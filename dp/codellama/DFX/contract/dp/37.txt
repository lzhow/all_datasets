  
No, the ` n GLi q_ ` variable in ` get Target Sw ap Data` is not dependent on ` _ assim ` in  ` Get Target S wap Data`.

The reason is that the value of `  n G Liq _ ` is calculated by adding the balances of all the reserves in a curve pool, and the balance of the reserve corresponding to the input asset is subtracted from the total balance. This means that `   nG Li q _` depends only on  the values of  `_length`, `curves. assets`, and `Assimb. viewNum eraire Balance`, which are all external to `Get Target SWap data`. Therefore, `NGL iq` does not depend on `_ assim`.
