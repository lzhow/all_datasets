yes

In the `constructor` of the `Ownable` contract, the contract state `_owner` is directly assigned the value of the local variable `msgSender`, which is obtained from the `_msgSender()` function call. This assignment creates a data dependency relationship between `_owner` and `msgSender`, as the value of `_owner` is determined by the value of `msgSender` at the time the constructor is executed. Therefore, `_owner` is data dependent on `msgSender`.
