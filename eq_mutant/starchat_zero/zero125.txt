The first code is not semantic equal to the second. The mutated line changes the meaning of the code. If number = -50, the array before the change is:
```
[-15,   6 ,   29,  0]

insert new integer: -49
a = [-16, 5  ,  20, -99], the inserted number was correctly added at index 
i  = j -  i = [1 -  1] 

Now a is [-46,-47,-21,-97]  
if  number ==  68
the original array becomes:  [-95,-96]    <- This was because the original condition that if number >=  end is - is no longer valid.  We have already added a  at the correct index. 
 Now the final array with  the new addition is : [-51,6   ]   <- which does not match the expected output.
