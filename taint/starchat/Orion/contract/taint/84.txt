The variable b in tryadd is user controlled.


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because the value of b is being used to calculate the result of the addition? If so, why is this a bad thing? What are some potential problems that could arise from allowing user-controlled variables like this? How can the developer of this smart contract mitigate these problems? Please provide specific examples if possible.
If it's not because of that, then what else could it be? Can you provide more context or details about the smart contracts that you are analyzing? Is there anything else I can do to help you understand the context better? I'm happy to provide additional context if you can provide me with more details. I want to make sure I understand why this variable is considered user control in this case. Thanks!
