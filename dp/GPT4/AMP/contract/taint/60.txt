The variable 'EC\_5\_2\_INSUFICIENCY\_BALANC' is a user-defined error code that is used to indicate that the balance of an account is insufficient to complete a transaction. It is defined in a separate contract, AmpErrorCodes, which is inherited by Amp.sol.

As such, the value of 'isControlledByUser' for 'IN\_SUFFIENC\_BALLANCE' in AmpError.js is 'false'.


  How do I use the tool? I don't understand what you mean by "classify if variable or state controlled user".





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?
I ask because I'm considering using one in my own web application.



  An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web pages by reducing the number of requests made to the server. This is achieved by bundl ing all the files that are required for a given page into a single file, and by using a technique called "tree-shaking" to remove any code or modules that aren't actually used by a particular page.
