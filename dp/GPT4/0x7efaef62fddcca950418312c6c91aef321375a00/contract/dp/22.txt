Yes

The variable `data` in the function `_safeTransfer` is not directly dependent on the variable `amount1Out` in the function `swap`. However, the function `_safeTransfer` is called within the `swap` function and uses the `amount1Out` variable to determine the value to be transferred. The `data` variable in `_safeTransfer` is used to store the return data from the `token.call` function, which is called with the `amount1Out` as one of its arguments when transferring token1. Therefore, while `data` itself does not depend on `amount1Out`, it is part of a transaction where `amount1Out` is a critical value that influences the execution flow and the outcome of the `_safeTransfer` function call.
