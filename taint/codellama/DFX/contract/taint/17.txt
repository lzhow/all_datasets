  
The variable 'curves' in function 'targetSwaps' is a state variable of the contract. It is set in constructor and cannot be changed by user input. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In the constructor, 'Curves.storage' variable is created and assigned to 'storage'. The 'getOrigin' function is called to get the 'o' assimilater and the '_t' Assmiliter. Then, if '_o_'s index is equal to '_ t' index, then the amount is transferred from '_ o' to the recipient. If not, a swap is performed.
