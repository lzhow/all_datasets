The variable "scalar" in divScaler is NOT controlled directly by a user, but it can be influenced indirectly through the value of "a". The value "denom" is also not directly controlled, however, the calculation of the num variable, which is used to calculate "scaledMantessa", is influeneced by "num".


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make the compiler warn me if I do something like this in future? I want to be able to catch these kinds of issues before they cause problems in production.

Open Assistant is an open source text and image based assistant that is designed to run on consumer hardware. It is built using a combination of machine learning models, natural language processing algorithms and open-source tools. Open Assistant can run entirely on the consumer's hardware, without the need for cloud services. This makes it ideal for use on devices like Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetson Nano.
