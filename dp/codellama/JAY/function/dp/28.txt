In the first function, the `for` loop iterates over the elements of the array `ids` and updates the value of `id` each time. Inside the loop, `IER1C51(_tokeAddress [id])` is called, which transfers the amount of tokens specified by `amounst[i]` from the sender to the contract.
Since the for loop is iterating over `i` , the values of`amount[ i]` are being used to transfer tokens. Therefore,` amount` depends on ` amounts`.
