  
The variable 'protocolSignFactor_' is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user through the 'setProtocolSignature' function. This function allows the owner of the contract to set the protocol sign factor, which is a critical component of smart contract security. Therefore, the ownership of this variable is directly controlled and managed by users.

In contrast, other variables such as the `DELIMETER` and `PROTOCOL_FEE_DEFAULT` are not directly user-controlled. They are constants that are defined in a specific way and cannot be changed by external users, even if they try to do so.
