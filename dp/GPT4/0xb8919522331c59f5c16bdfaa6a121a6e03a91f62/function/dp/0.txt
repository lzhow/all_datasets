  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `address( proxy ).staticCall( hex" f8 5 1 a 4 0" )` expression is evaluated, which returns a tuple of two values: a boolean value indicating whether the call was successful, and a bytes value containing the return data.
 The `require( success ) ` expression checks whether ` success` is true, if not, it will revert the transaction.  The return value of the expression `abi. decode( retu rnda t, address )`, which is a function call, is assigned to the local variable` success`.
 In the second function , the same expression` address ( proxy). staticCall ( hex " f 8  5  1  a  4  0 " ) is also evaluated. However, this time, we do not assign the result to a local  variable. Instead,  we directly use the returned value in a comparison expression. Therefore, in this case, ` proxy` and ` address` are dependent on each other.
