The function call `_addtokenTopartition(_operator,_partition,_value)` sets the `_balanceOfbyPartition` of the address `_to` and the partition `_partition` to the sum of its current value and `_Value`.

However, the call to `_calloperatorDataHooks` is made after the balance has already been updated, so the value of `_balance` will be incorrect.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  Data dependency is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value depends on another. In the context of smart contracts, data dependencies refer to how changes in one contract state or variable can affect the behavior of another contract or function.
In the code you provided, there is an internal function called `_AddTokentopartition`. This function sets a value in a mapping called `balanceOfPartition`. The value is set to be the current balance of that address plus the amount of tokens being transferred. However, this function is called after a call is being made to an external function, which could potentially change the state of those variables. This means that the final value that is stored in
