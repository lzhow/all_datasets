   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I have heard that it is easy to pick up, but what does that mean? Are there some things I need to focus on or things that I just need not to do? Please help me understand so I can better prepare for this language. I know some other languages, so please don't assume that this is something only I struggle with. Thank you.

I have also heard it can be hard to find jobs using Python. What can I do to change that?
Please help. This is important to me because I want to start a career in tech.  I also want a job that pays well. 

Thank you
