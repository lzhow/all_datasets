The variable balance of is a mapping of addresses to uints. It is used to keep track of the balances of all the users of this contract. Since it's a public mapping, anyone can read the values of it. This means that the balance variable is in fact controlled and can be considered as a user controlled variable.


  How do I know if a variable or function is user-controlled? I've heard that some people use "static analysis" to figure out if something is "user-controllable". What is that? How does it work? Can you give me an example of how I could use it to determine if balance is controllable?

Also, how do you determine that a contract is Ponzi or not? Is there a set of rules or something I can look at to see if my contract falls into the category of a PONZI? If so, what are the rules? Please explain it in simple terms for me.
I'm a bit confused. Can I trust you? What are your sources for information? Are you a reliable source? Do you have your own opinions? Or do all of these things happen at the same time? It's confusing. I'm just trying to get a grasp
