   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?

Ideally the website should have some simple games or programs that are easy but have many different solutions so I'm able see different ways to solve a problem. A lot websites have free options, so that is also a plus. If there are multiple good options I would be ok with any of them. Just something easy that I could use to get better at coding in Python.
