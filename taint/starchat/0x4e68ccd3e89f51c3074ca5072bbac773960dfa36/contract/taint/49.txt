   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization of web apps works under the hood. Thanks!



  An incremental bundlers like Webpack is designed to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the end user's browser. This makes it much easier for the browser to load the application since it only needs to download a small amount of data instead of having to make multiple requests for each individual file.

However, this bunding process can also introduce some problems since different parts of the code may depend on different versions of other files. For example, if file A depends on version 3 of file B but file C depends version on 4 of B, then Webpack may try to include both versions in your bundle file, which may cause errors or other
