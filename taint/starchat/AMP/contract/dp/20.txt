   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning how-to code Python.  The best way is to find a tutorial that you like and follow the instructions step-by-step.   You can find many tutorials online, but some of the best ones are from the official Python website, https://www.python.org/doc/.  You should also consider using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to make your coding easier. Some popular IDEs for Python include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Spyder. Once you have an IDE set up, you can start following tutorials and practicing your Python skills. Good luck!
