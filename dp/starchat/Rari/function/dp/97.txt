function _preapare() external {
  if(msg sender!= this) {
    (latestCETHDelegate, allowresign, becomeimplementationdata)
    =fuseadmin.latesetCethDelegate()
    if implementation!= latesetcETHdelegate {
      _implementationinternal(latestCETHDlegate,allowresgin,becomImplementationdata);
    }
  }
}
In this code, the variables become implementation data and latestCEthDelegate are contract variables.
