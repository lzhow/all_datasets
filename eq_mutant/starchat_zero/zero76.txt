Yes, the above provided codes for Java and C are'semantically equivalent'.&#09;In Java the mutated code tries to sort an array in descending order and in the C code it is trying to do so in ascending order. However the numbers used are negative which negates the whole sort in reverse order, which is the semantic difference between the codes.
