Explanation: The variable `amountIn` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is not directly controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the input parameters and the internal logic of the function. The value of `amountIn` is derived from the `amounts` array, which is calculated based on the input parameters and the supported factory type. Therefore, the user does not have direct control over the value of `amountIn`.
