  
No, the ` er c7 51 Ids` variable in function `bu yJ ay` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` buy J ay ` function is called by a user, but the value of the` erC 75 9Ids ` variable is passed as an argument to the  function, so it cannot be controlled directly by  the caller.
