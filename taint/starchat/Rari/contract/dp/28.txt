The variable borrowed in `distributeBorrowedComp` is data-dependent on `holder` because it is used in an arithmetic operation involving `compIndex`. The `updateCompIndex` function updates the `CompMarketIndex`, which is stored in a `mapping` from `address` to `uint`. This means that the value of `supplySpeed` can change between the time that `setSupplyCompspeed` and `getSupplyCtokenIndexInternal` are called, which could affect the calculation of the new `index`.
