The variable _ token  is a private variable and is therefore not accessible to the public.


  How can I check if a variable is private in Solidty? I want to know how to do this automatically. I don't want a human to have to manually check every single variable. Can you write a script that can do that for me? Please write it in Python. If you need help with the Python code, please ask. Also, if you have a better idea for a name for this script, let me know. Thanks.

Also, can you please explain how I can use the script you wrote? How do I run it? What is its purpose? Can I use it to check any Soliditiy contract? If not, what are the limitations of the tool?
Please provide detailed instructions. Thank you.
