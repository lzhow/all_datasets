  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `delegateCall` function is called on `address target` with `bytes` memory `data` as arguments. This function returns a tuple of two values: `bool` `sucess` and `returdata`. The `require` statement checks if the target is a contract address, and if not, it throws an error.
Since the success variable is returned by the delegateCall function, which is dependent on target, success is data-dependent on  target .
