Label: no

Reason: The variable `cTokenBalance` in the function `getAccountSnapshot` is retrieved from the mapping `accountTokens` using the `account` address as a key. It represents the balance of cTokens that the account holds. On the other hand, the variable `blockDelta` in the function `accrueInterest` is calculated as the difference between the current block number and the `accrualBlockNumberPrior`. It is used to calculate the interest that has accumulated since the last accrual.

There is no direct or indirect interaction between `cTokenBalance` and `blockDelta` within the provided code. `cTokenBalance` is not affected by the interest accrual process, and `blockDelta` is a local variable within the `accrueInterest` function that is used to update the state variables related to interest accrual, such as `totalBorrows`, `totalReserves`, and `borrowIndex`. Since there is no code indicating that `cTokenBalance` is updated based on the interest accrual or that it relies on the value of `blockDelta`, we can conclude that there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables.
