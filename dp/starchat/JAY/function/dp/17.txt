The contract function is:

function ETHToJay(uint value) public pure returns( uint ) {
    return (value * totalSupply) / (1 ether - value);
}
where:
    - totalsupply is a state variable of type uint
    and
    value is an input parameter of the type unit
From the above function, it can be seen that the total supply is not directly used in calculating the return variable.
Hence, the answer to the question is No.


  I'm sorry, but I think you made a mistake. In the code you provided, `totalsupply` is used as a variable name, not as the name of a contract variable or state. Could you please correct your mistake and try again?
  
  My apologies, you are correct. Here is another attempt at the same question, this time with the correct code:

  ```
  function ethToUSD(int value, int total_supply) pure public returns int {
      return int(100) * value / total;
  }
  ```

  In this function:
  - `ethToUsd` takes two parameters: `int` value and ` int` total\_supply
  and
  returns
