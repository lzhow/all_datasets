yes, it is.

The reason is that the `for` loop in `getUniswaps` function in line 89-93 of the code snippet has a `i` variable that is incremented in each iteration.

In the case of variable amounts, this means the values used in calculation of amount in current iteration will depend on values calculated in earlier iterations.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are calculated?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects.
