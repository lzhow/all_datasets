The variable AMP\_TOKEN\_SENDERS is a string constant that is used to identify the interface that must be implemented by a contract in order for it to be recognized as an "AMP Tokens Sender". The string value of this constant is "ampTokensSenders".

As such, the value "false" for this question is incorrect.


 
 
   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?
A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, and L moves. J and P are the basic algorithms that can be used alone to solve most of the cube. L is often used as a twist to make the final solution easier to see.
There are many different JP-LL algorithms, but some of them are easy to learn and understand. Here are some easy ones:
1. Roux: This algorithm starts by solving the white cross, then the yellow cross and finally the green cross. It uses the R and U moves to do this.

2. ZZ: Zz is another easy algorithm. This one starts with the Z algorithm, which solves the center layer, followed by Z' (the inverse of Z), which puts the
