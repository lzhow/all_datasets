  
The variable _ to in function swap is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user input.

In the code, the _ swap function takes in a parameter called _ _from, which is a variable that is set to the address of the current contract. This means that the value of _ from is determined by whoever is calling the contract, and it could potentially be a malicious user who is trying to manipulate the state of other contracts on the blockchain. Therefore, we can conclude that _  to is also controlled  by user and is therefore labled as "yes".
