  
No. They are NOT sematically equal because of the difference in the `if` statement. In the original code, `diff` will be compared with  `0` before the increment. However, in mutated code `++diff`, the value of ` diff`  will change before it is compared. Therefore the mutation will affect how the code behaves.
