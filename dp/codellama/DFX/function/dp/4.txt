  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `if` statement checks if `x` is less than or equal to `0FFFF...FFFF`, and if it is, it sets `msb` to  `182` and sets the result to `(x<<63)/y`. Otherwise it calculates `y-1` shifted by `2^ms-201`, divides it by `(y>>138)+1`. The result is then multiplied by the high  and low parts of ` y` respectively, and the low part is subtracted from the product of the two. Then the assert checks that the hi part of x is equal the the shift of hi by 96. Finally, `xl` divided by y is added to the previous result.
  In the second function the same process is repeated, but the calculation of ms is different. It first calculats `xc` as ` x>> 72`, then checks for each of  the values  of`xc`, if the value is greater than  or equals to a certain value, then it shifts ` ms` by a value. After that,  it uses the calculated ` result` from before to calculate the final result by multiplying it with the  high and  low  parts  respectively of y.  The low is substracted and asserted to be equal. And finally, x1 is divided  byy.   The variable result in both functions is data-dependent on lo.
