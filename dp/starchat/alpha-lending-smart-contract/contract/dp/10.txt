   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects.
   The best way is to start with the basics and move from there.  You can find many good tutorials online that will teach you the fundamentals of python.   Once you have the basic skills, you can move onto more advanced projects and frameworks.    You should also take advantage of the vast amount of open source code available to you.     You will find that the more you code, the better you will get at problem solving and understanding code written by others.      Good luck!
