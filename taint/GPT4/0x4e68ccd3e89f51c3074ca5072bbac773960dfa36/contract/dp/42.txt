The variable `feeGrowthBelow0X128` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is data dependent on the variable `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` in the same function. This is because `feeGrowthBelow0X128` is directly assigned a value based on the condition that checks the `tickCurrent` against `tickLower`. If `tickCurrent` is greater than or equal to `tickLower`, `feeGrowthBelow0X128` is assigned the value of `lower.feeGrowthOutside0X128`. Otherwise, it is assigned the result of the subtraction `feeGrowthGlobal0X128 - lower.feeGrowthOutside0X128`. In both branches of the conditional, the value of `feeGrowthBelow0X128` is influenced by the value of `feeGrowthGlobal0X128`, either directly or indirectly through subtraction.
