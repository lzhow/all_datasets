Explanation: The variable `borrowState` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is not controlled by the user. It is a storage variable defined in the contract and is used to store the state of the CompMarket for borrowing. The function updates the `borrowState` based on the current market borrow index and the borrow speed, but the user does not have direct control over this variable.
