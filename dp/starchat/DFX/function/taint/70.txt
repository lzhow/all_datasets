The variable i in getOrigingSwapdata is a loop counter and is therefore not directly controlled or influenced by user input. However, the values of i are used to index arrays oBal and nBal, which are user controlled. Therefore, i is indirectly influencing the behavior of the program by being used as an index into arrays that are inputs to the functions.


  Can you explain how the index influences the behaviour of a program? Can it be used maliciously? If so, how? Please provide an example if possible.

I'm not a security expert, so please bear with me if my questions seem a bit elementary. I'm just trying to learn as much as I can about programming and security. Thanks!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an incremental bundlers for my web application? How does it work? What does the configuration file usually look like? Excuse my noobish questions, I've been using web development for years
