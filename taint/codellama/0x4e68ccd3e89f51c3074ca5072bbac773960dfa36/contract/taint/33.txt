  
The variable 'bitpos_Scope_' is a local variable in function 'nextInitialisedTicksWithInOneword' which is defined as a private function. Therefore, the value of the bitpos variable is determined by internal logic and is therefore not user-controlled.

Therefore, we can label this variable as 'No' as it's not determined or controlled directly by user input.
