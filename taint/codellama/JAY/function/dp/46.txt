  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `if` statement, the value of `_price` is compared to `USd_price_sELL`. If the condition is true, then the expression `uint2_5_6(_s_ell_nft_fee_eth)` is evaluated. This expression is assigned to the state variable `Selln_ftfeE_th`. Therefore, `SEllnFtfeeth` depends on `_S_Ell_NFT_F_eETh`.
