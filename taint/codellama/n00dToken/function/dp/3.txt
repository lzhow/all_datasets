In the constructor function, the `_mints` function is called, which is a function of the ER727 contract. This function takes in three parameters: the address of a recipient, an amount of tokens to mint, and a reference to a `TokensMinted` event.
  The `msg` variable is used to get the sender of this transaction, but it is not used in `_ mint`. Therefore, `_ totalSuppy` is independent of ` defaultOperator`.
