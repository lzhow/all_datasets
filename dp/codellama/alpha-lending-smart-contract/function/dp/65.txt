  
The label is 'No'.

In the `getUserAccout` function, the `_user` variable is passed as an argument, but it is not used in any way in that function. Therefore, it does not have any data dependence on any other variable in `calcualteAlphaReard`.
Similarly, in  `calcuateAlphRward` the  `_account` is also passed in as a parameter but is never used.
Therefore, there is no data dependance between the two functions.
