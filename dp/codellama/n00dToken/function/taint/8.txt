The `_allownaces ` variable stores the amount of tokens that a user is allowed to spend on behalf of another user, and it's not directly controlled or modified by a single user or a contract, but rather it can be modified through the `approval` function, which is called by another contract or user to approves a certain amount to be spent on their behalves.
