Label: no

Reason: The variable `_operator` in the function `authorizeOperator` and the variable `_operator` in the function `isOperatorForCollateralManager` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. This means that each `_operator` variable only exists within the lexical scope of the function in which it is defined. They are not related to each other outside of their function's scope and do not share any state. The value of one does not depend on or affect the value of the other, hence there is no data dependency relationship between them.
