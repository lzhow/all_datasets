Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `b` in the function `trySub` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, and its value is determined by the caller of the function. However, without further context or information about how the value of `b` is obtained, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not. Therefore, the label for the variable `b` is "unknown".
