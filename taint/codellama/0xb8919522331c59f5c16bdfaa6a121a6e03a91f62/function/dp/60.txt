In this case, the relationship between the two contract variables is not explicitly defined in code. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether they have data dependencies.
However, we can make an educated guess based on their names and the context in which they appear. In this example, `_BEAON` is a contract variable that is used to store the address of a beacon contract, while `_ IMPLMENTAION_ SLOT ` is an internal variable used by the `StorageSlo`t contract to manage storage slots. It is possible that the implementation of the `_ getBeaon` function relies on `_ BEACO`N_SLO`T` to retrieve the beacons address, but this is only speculation. Without further information, such as the definition of `_ GETBEaON`, it's difficult for us to say for sure whether the variables have any data dependence.
