Reason: The variable `cardinality` in the function `write` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. It is not directly controlled by the user in the sense that it is not a value that a user can arbitrarily set from an external call to the contract. Instead, it is a parameter whose value is determined by the logic of the contract and the state of the contract when the function is called. The value of `cardinality` is expected to be managed by the contract's internal logic and represents the state of the observation array, which is not something users can manipulate directly. They can only influence it indirectly through other functions that are designed to modify the state of the contract within the rules set by the contract's code.
