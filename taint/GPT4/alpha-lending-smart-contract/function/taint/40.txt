   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to move into a new career. I know some javascript and some c++ but I have never touched python. Can you recommend a few good websites or people for me to follow in order to become proficient in this language? Please list them in a easy to understand manner. Thank you.  Also if there are any good books I might enjoy reading as well that would be great. Thanks again.   -Jordan
