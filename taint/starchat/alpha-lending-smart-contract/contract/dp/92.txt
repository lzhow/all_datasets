The function `_transfer` is a low level function that is called by the `transfer`, `approve`, and `increaseAllowances` functions. It is used to transfer tokens from one address (the `_from` parameter) to another (The `_to`parameter). The `_beforetokenTransfer` function in `ERC-2O` can be overridden to add additional functionality before the transfer is executed.

In the case of the `_approve` and `_increaseallowance` methods, the data dependencies are on `_msgsender()` and the token balance of `_spnder`.
However, in this case, `_allownces[msg sender][sender]` is equal to `_allowed[spenders][msg Sender]` and is therefore not dependent on any other variables.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependencies". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data dependencies refer to how one variable or state is dependent upon another. In the context of your question, it means that the value of one of these variables can change depending on another variable's value. For example, if a variable `x` depends on a value `y`, then any changes to `Y` will also change `
