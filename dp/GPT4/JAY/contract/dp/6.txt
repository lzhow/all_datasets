Reason: The variable `success` in the function `sell` is used to store the return value of a low-level call to transfer Ethereum. It is a local variable that captures whether the ETH transfer was successful or not. The `price` variable in the function `updateFees` is used to store the latest price from the `priceFeed` contract. The `price` variable is used to calculate the new fees based on the latest price data from an oracle.

The `success` variable in `sell` is not directly influenced by the `price` variable in `updateFees`. The `success` variable's value is determined by the execution of the ETH transfer, while the `price` variable's value is determined by the latest data from the oracle. There is no direct data flow or computational dependency between these two variables in the given context of the smart contract functions. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
