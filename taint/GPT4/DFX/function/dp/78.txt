Reason: The variable `result` in the function `add` is not directly dependent on any variable in the function `abs`. However, it is possible that the value of `result` could be indirectly affected by the value of `x` in the function `abs` if `x` is used as an input argument for the `add` function. Without further information about how the `add` function is called and whether `x` from `abs` is passed as an argument to `add`, we cannot determine the data dependency relationship between `result` and `x` in this case.
