   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I have heard that it is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I also heard it can be difficult to debug, so I'd like to avoid that if possible. Can you recommend some resources or tutorials that would help me learn Python quickly and effectively? Thank you!
