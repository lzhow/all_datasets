  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if `reserverIn`, ` reserveout`, and ` amountin` are greater than 1. If they aren't, it throws an error.
Then, `numerator` is calculated as ` numer = (amountin * 907) * reserve out`.
`denominator ` is then calculated to be `denom = reservin *1,098 + ( amount in *9,96)`.
Finally, amount out is set to `num / denom`.  The variable amountout is dependent on amount In.
