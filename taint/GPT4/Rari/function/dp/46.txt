Label: yes

Reason: The variable `numerator` in the function `divScalarByExp` is assigned the value of the multiplication result of `expScale` and `scalar`. The value of `scalar` is passed as an argument to the function `divScalarByExp`. On the other hand, the variable `a` in the function `mulExp` is also passed as an argument to the function `mulExp`. Since the value of `scalar` is used in the calculation of `numerator` and `scalar` is dependent on `a`, there is a data dependency relationship between `numerator` and `a`.
