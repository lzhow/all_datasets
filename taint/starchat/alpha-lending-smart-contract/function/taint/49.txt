Or maybe you can give me some tips on how I can figure it out myself? Thanks!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to the server during development. This is achieved by bundLING together (or bundlinG) all the files that are required to run the application, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets. An incremental bundle is created by comparing the current state of the project with a previous version of itself, to identify which files have changed and only include those in
