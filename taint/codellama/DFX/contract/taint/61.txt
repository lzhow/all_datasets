  
The variable 'token' in function 'safePermis' is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the 'Saferc2O' library is imported in this contract, and the token variable is passed as an argument to the safe Permit function. However, the ownership of the SaferC 2 O library and its functions is unclear. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the ` token` variable in safe permit is under the control of a user or not.
