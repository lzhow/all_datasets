The variable b in mod() is user-controlled.

In Solidty, function parameters are passed by value, meaning that a copy of the argument is made and passed to the called function. This means that any changes made to variables inside the calling function will not be reflected in variables outside the call, as the variables are separate entities. However, for user input variables, this can be a security concern, so Solidit provides the keyword "memory" to allow the input to be passed as a reference, rather than a separate copy.


  Can you explain how the memory keyword works?  What is it used for?
Can you give an example of how it would be used in this case?  
What are the pros and cons of using memory in Solidiity?  

Thank you
