The variable `TOKEN_AMOUNT_TYPEHASH` is not present in the provided Solidity contract code. Since the variable is not part of the code, it cannot be classified as controlled by the user or not. If it were present and defined as a constant or a state variable that is not set by user input, it would typically be labeled as 'no' because such variables are usually predefined and not subject to change by user actions. However, without the actual variable in the code, we cannot provide a definitive classification, but based on the context of the question, it seems like it would not be user-controlled.
