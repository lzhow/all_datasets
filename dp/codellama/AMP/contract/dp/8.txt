  
No, the ` total Supply By Partitions` contract is not dependent on `_ value` variable in ` transfer From` function.

The ` _ value ` variable is used to determine the amount of tokens to transfer, but it is only used in a local context within the `_transerBy Partiton` internal function, and it does not affect the value of the` total supply by partition` state. Therefore, `Total Supplies By partition ` is independent of `_ Value` .
