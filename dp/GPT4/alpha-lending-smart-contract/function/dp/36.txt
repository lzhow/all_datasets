Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `claim`, the variable `receipt` is a storage pointer to an element in the `receipts` array, identified by the index `_receiptID`. The variable `pending` is calculated based on the properties of `receipt`, specifically `receipt.createdAt`, `receipt.amount`, and `receipt.claimedAmount`. Furthermore, `receipt.claimedAmount` is updated based on the value of `pending` within the conditional statement `if (pending > 0)`. This update to `receipt.claimedAmount` establishes a data dependency between `receipt` and `pending`, as the state of `receipt` (specifically the `claimedAmount` field) is directly influenced by the value of `pending`. Therefore, `receipt` and `pending` have a data dependency relationship in the context of the `claim` function.
