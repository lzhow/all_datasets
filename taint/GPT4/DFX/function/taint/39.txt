Explanation: The variable `__weight` in the function `includeAsset` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the input parameter `_weight` and some fixed values (`1e18` and `1`). The calculation does not involve any user input or external factors that could be controlled by the user. Therefore, the variable `__weight` is not controlled by the user.
