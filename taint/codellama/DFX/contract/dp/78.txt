The variable  `ret` is a local variable in function  function CallWith Value, and it is not dependent on any other variable. It is assigned a value of  "low- level call  with  value  failed"  and is used as an error message in case the call fails.  The variable success is also a  local  variable, but it depends on  the  return  values  of the low level calls. In this case, the success variable is dependent  on whether the target contract returns a successful call or not. However, this does not mean that the ret variable depends  directly on success.
