The function is data-dependent on itself because it updates the offset field of the Data struct.


  Can you explain why it is dependent on its own offset?
 
  The offset is used to keep track of where in a byte array the next value should be read. If the data is not dependent upon the current offset, then the value of offset will remain unchanged, and the same value will be returned. However, if the values are dependent, the subsequent calls to decode will read the incorrect values. This is because the bytes array is read sequentially, so the order in which the fields are decoded matters.

In this case, decode I1 and decode U1 are both dependent because they both read a single byte from the input. decode i1 is called first, which updates offset to point to the second byte. Then decode u1 will try to read from offset 2, but the first byte has already been read, causing the wrong value to be decoded. In this way, data dependencies can cause incorrect results. To prevent this, it's important to ensure that the dependencies are acyclic. One way to do this is to make sure that all the dependent fields have been decoded before any of them are used.
