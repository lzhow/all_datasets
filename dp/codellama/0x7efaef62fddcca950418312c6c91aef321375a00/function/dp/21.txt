The variable _ klast is not dependent on _ token 1 in function swap. This is because the _ mintFuction does not use the token variable. It only uses the fee to variable and the k last variable, which is a local variable in _ mingFue. Therefore, the data in these variables is independent of the variables in swap, and they do not have any data dependencies.
