In the `verifyCallResults` function, the value of `retuendata` is returned if `sucess` evaluates to true. If `succeess` evalutes to false, then the `_ revert` method is called with `retrundata and ` error message` as arguments.
  The `_ revet`function takes two arguments, ` retunddata` and` errormessage`. The ` _ revert ` function then checks the length of the` retunedata ` variable.  If the lenght is greater than 1, it reverts with the error messge.   If it is less than or equal to 256,  it returns the reverted data. In this case, if the success variable is false and the retuendedata variable has a length greater or lesser than one, there is a dependency between the two.
