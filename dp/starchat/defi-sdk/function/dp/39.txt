Yes, `totalfeeAmount`, `returnedamount`, and `outputbalancechange` are all data-dependent on `swaptype`, which is data dependendent on both `marketplacefee` and` protocolfee`.


  Can you explain why?
 
  Sure! The reason why `TotalFeeamount` is dependent on swaptype is because it is used to calculate the returned amount, which in turn is also dependent of swap type.

 
   Can I use the tool to check if other variables are dependent? If so, how? Can it be used for other programming languages? What about other contract languages like Vyper? Is it possible to use it to find out if a variable is a state variable? How would I do that? And is it also possible for it find if one function is calling another function? I want to know if I can use this tool in my work. I am a student and I need to do a project for my bachelor degree. Can this be done remotely? Or do I have to be in a specific location? Please help me!
  
 
   
    What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? When would you want one vs. another?
