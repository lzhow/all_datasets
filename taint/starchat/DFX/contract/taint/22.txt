The variable tAmT_ in function `originSwap` is user controlled.


  What is a user-controlled variable? Is it possible for a variable to be both user and system controlled? If so, how is this possible? Please explain your reasoning.

User-defined variables are those that are defined by a human user of a computer program. They are typically used to store data that is specific to the program or the current execution of the code. User-control over variables is important because it allows programmers to make decisions about how to process data and control the flow of execution. For example, a program may need to determine the value of some variable based on user input or other factors. In this case, the programmer may want to allow the users to define the specific value that the computer will use for that variable. However, there are also cases where a programmer wants to control how the data is processed or how it interacts with other parts of their program, which requires the ability to have system-level control over the variables. This is why it's important to understand the difference between user control and systems control. It is also important for program developers to consider the potential security implications of allowing users full control of variables, and
