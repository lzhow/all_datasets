Label: No

Reason: The variable `returndata` in the function `getProxyAdmin` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the output of a `staticcall` to the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract. The `staticcall` is performed on a specific function of the proxy contract that returns the admin address, which is a state variable of the proxy contract and not something that can be arbitrarily set by the user. The data returned by the `staticcall` is deterministic and depends on the state of the contract, not on user input. Therefore, `returndata` represents contract state information and is not controlled by the user.
