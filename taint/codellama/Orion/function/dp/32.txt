  
The label is 'No'.

In the `function` ` getY`, the local variable` c` is assigned a value of `D` and is then modified by the loop. However, the value assigned to ` c ` is not dependent on any external state, including the state of the contract or the input parameters.
On the other hand, in ` function` get `Amount` In `Universial`, there is no variable named `C`.
Therefore, there are no data dependencies between the two functions.
