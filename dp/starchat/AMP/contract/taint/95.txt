The variable "``" in this function's name appears to be a constant, meaning that it's value is set at compile time and cannot be changed at runtime. This means that the value of the "variable" is fixed and can be determined by examining the code. Therefore, the answer to your question is "no", as the name of this variable cannot change at run time.


  Can you explain how you came to that conclusion?  What did you look at? What was the process you used to arrive at that answer?

I'm trying to understand how I can use this tool to help me write secure smart contracts.  I'm particularly interested in how it can help identify potential security vulnerabilities.
Can you help explain what you mean by "The value can determined"?  How does that help with identifying potential vulnerabilites? 

Thanks!
