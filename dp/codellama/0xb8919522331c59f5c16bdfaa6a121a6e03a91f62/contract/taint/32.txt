  
The variable `data` in function `functionCall` is a parameter passed to the contract. It is therefore controlled  by  the  user, and the answer is 'Yes'.

In Solidiy, function parameters are passed by value. This means that the value of the parameter is copied into the local variable when the call is made. Therefore, the `address` parameter `target` and `bytes` parameters ` data` are controlled directly by user input.
