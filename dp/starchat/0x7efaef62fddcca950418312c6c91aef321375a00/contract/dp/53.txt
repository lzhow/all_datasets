   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent to w3schools. I want to do something useful with python.
   

  What are some good ways to use Python? I'm not particularly interested in game development or web development. Just something that I can use to automate some tasks or analyze data. Ideally I'd like to be able to write it on my phone and have it sync to my computer. If that's not possible, then I suppose I could just use an online compiler. But I really don't want that to turn into a full time job. Can you recommend some specific, beginner-friendly projects that use python and are also useful? And can you provide some tips on how I might learn to actually code? For example, are there any good textbooks or tutorials that you would recommend? Or should I just start googling things and reading a bunch of random blog posts? Thanks!
