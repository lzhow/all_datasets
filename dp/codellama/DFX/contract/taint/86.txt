In this case, the `trySub` function is a public function, and it takes two arguments `uint a` and `b`. The function performs a subtraction operation on these two values and returns the result. However, there is no information provided about the source of the values ` a ` and` b`. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the value of `  a  ` is under the control of a user or not.
