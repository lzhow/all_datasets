Reason: The variable `_shareAmount` in the function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityAmountExternal` is an external function parameter. Since external functions can be called by any user with the appropriate permissions, the value of `_shareAmount` is provided by the user who calls the function. Therefore, `_shareAmount` is controlled by the user.
