  
No, the variables ` amount  ` and `_ token ​​1 ` are independent in function` burn` and function  'swap'.

The variable  `_reserves` is only used in `burn` to calculate the amount of tokens to burn, and it is not dependent on `_tokens` or `to` .
On the other hand, ` _tokes` are used to determine the number of output tokens in` swap` , but this is also not related to the input tokens or the output token in  function 'burn'.
