The contract variable _ balances is not dependent on variable  _ value in function  `_ transferBy Partitions`.
This is because the _ balanceOf By Partiton function is called before the  ` _ removeToken From Partion` function, which modifies the balance of the token. Therefore, the value of _  balanaces is determined before _ transferbyPartitions is executed.
