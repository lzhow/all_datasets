The variable _TYPE HASH is a constant that is defined in line 10 of the code. It is assigned the value of keckak 2 5 6 ("Permitt( address owner , address spendder , uint 3 4 8 value ,uint 7 9  nonc , uin  t  _  dead line )") and is used to hash the struct of parameters for the permit function. Since it's a fixed value that' s defined at compile time, the contract creator can' t change it, and it can not be controlled or manipulated by a user, so it should be labeled as 'No'.
