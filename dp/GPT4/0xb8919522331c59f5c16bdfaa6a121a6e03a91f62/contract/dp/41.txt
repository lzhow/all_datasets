Reason: The contract state `_owner` is a state variable defined in the `Ownable` contract and represents the owner of the contract. The variable `proxy` in the function `getProxyImplementation` is a parameter of that function within the `ProxyAdmin` contract. The function `getProxyImplementation` is designed to return the implementation address of a `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` instance. It does not read from, write to, or in any way interact with the `_owner` state variable. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_owner` and `proxy` within the context of the `getProxyImplementation` function.
