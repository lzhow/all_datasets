In the `upgrateAndCal` function, the parameter `implemenation` is passed as an argument to the method `proxy. upgradeTo` and ` proxy .upgradetoAndcall`. These methods are part of the OpenZeppelin library and are used to upgrade the implementation of a proxy contract.
Since the argument ` implementation`is passed to these methods, which are called by a user, and the methods themselves are not modified by any user-controlled code, ` implemntation ` is considered to be controlledby theuser.
