Explanation: The variable `_threshold_scope_0` is data dependent on the variable `fee_` in the function `calculateMicroFee`. This is because the value of `_threshold_scope_0` is calculated based on the value of `_bal`, `_ideal`, and `_beta`, which are also used in the calculation of `fee_`. Therefore, any changes in the value of `fee_` will affect the value of `_threshold_scope_0`, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
