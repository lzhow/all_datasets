Explanation: 

Based on the given code, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `index` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` and the variable `compSpeed` in the function `_setCompSupplySpeed`. The code snippet provided does not show any direct interaction or assignment between these two variables. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they have a data dependency relationship without further information about the code or its execution context.
