The contract state `EC_51_TRANSFER_SUCCESS` is not present in the provided Solidity contract code. Therefore, it cannot have a data dependency relationship with any variable, including the variable in the function `allowanceByPartition`. The function `allowanceByPartition` returns the allowance for a spender by a token holder for a specific partition, which is retrieved from the mapping `_allowedByPartition`. Since `EC_51_TRANSFER_SUCCESS` is not defined or used in the contract, there is no data dependency between it and any other variable or state in the contract.
