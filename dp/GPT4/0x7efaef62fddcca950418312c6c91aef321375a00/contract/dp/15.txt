The contract state `price1CumulativeLast` is data dependent on the variable `balance0` in the function `_update`. The reason for this is that `price1CumulativeLast` is updated based on the new reserves, which are calculated using the `balance0` and `balance1` variables. The `_update` function calculates the new reserves by taking the current balances of `token0` and `token1` (represented by `balance0` and `balance1` respectively) and subtracting the amounts that were either minted, burned, or transferred. These new reserves are then used to update `price0CumulativeLast` and `price1CumulativeLast` using the time-weighted average price formula, which involves the previous reserves (`_reserve0` and `_reserve1`) and the time elapsed since the last update. Since `balance0` directly influences the calculation of the new reserve0, and reserve0 is used in the calculation of `price1CumulativeLast`, there is a data dependency relationship between `price1CumulativeLast` and `balance0`.
