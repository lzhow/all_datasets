Explanation:
In the `keccack226` function, the `_basecurrency` and `_quotecurrency ` variables are passed as arguments. These variables have been declared as function parameters, and they have not been modified within the scope of the current function. Therefore, ` curveid` is data-dependent on `_ quotecurrency`.
