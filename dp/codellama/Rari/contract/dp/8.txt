  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `add` function, the first argument `a` is assigned the value of `toDripped`, which is calculated using the expression `mul(delta_dip, block_number - drips_start, "dripsTotal underfow")`. The second argument is `b`, and it is also assigned a value using `sub(a, drippped, 'delta driip underlow')`. Therefore, `block_numbe` and ` dript_ start` are both data-dependent on ` delta_driip`.
Similarly, in `min`, the second parameter ` b` depends on both ` a`and `c`. Since ` c`is also data depend on` delta dri ip`, ` min` also depends data on  ` block number`
Therefore, both variables ` to dri p` `and` drippe d`are data dependencies on variable`delta d rip`.
