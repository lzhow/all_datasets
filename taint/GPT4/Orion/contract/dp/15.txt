No, the variable `amount0Out` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `reserveInput`. 

Explanation: The variable `amount0Out` is assigned the value of `uint256(0)` if `input == token0`, otherwise it is assigned the value of `amountOut`. The value of `reserveInput` is not used in this assignment. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
