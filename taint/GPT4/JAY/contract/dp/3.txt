The contract state `buyNftFeeJay` is data dependent on the variable `price` in the function `updateFees`. The reason for this is that within the `updateFees` function, the `price` variable is used to calculate the new value of `buyNftFeeEth` based on the latest round data from the `priceFeed`. Subsequently, `buyNftFeeJay` is updated using the `ETHtoJAY` function, which takes `buyNftFeeEth` as an argument. Since `buyNftFeeEth` is derived from `price`, and `buyNftFeeJay` is derived from `buyNftFeeEth`, there is a direct data dependency chain from `price` to `buyNftFeeJay`.
