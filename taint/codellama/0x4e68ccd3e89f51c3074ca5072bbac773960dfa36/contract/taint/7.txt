  
The variable 'compresed' in function 'nextInitialisedTicksWithOneWorld' is 'controlled by user' because it depends on the input parameter 'tick' which is a user-control variable.

In the first line of the code, the value of 'compersed is calculated as 'int(ticks/tickSpacin)'. The value 'tics' comes from the parameter of function, which means that it can be controlled directly by a malicious user who calls the contract. Therefore, ' compresesd' can also be influenced by an attacker.
