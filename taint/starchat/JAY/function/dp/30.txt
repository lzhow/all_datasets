The function updateFee() is a function in a smart contract named JayCoin. It is used to update the fees for selling and buying JAY NFTs.

In the updateFees() function, the price of Jays is retrieved from the Chainlink price feed contract, and is stored in _usdPrice. This value is then used in two calculations:
1. _buyJaysFee: This is calculated as the amount of ether that is needed to purchase 0.01 JYCs, or 5 cents, at the current price. If the _usPrice is greater than USD\_PRICE\_BUy, then the calculation is performed as usual. However, if the \_usdprice is less than or equal to USDPRICEBUYy, it is set to 99 cent.

2. \_sellJysFee is similarly calculated, but instead of using the  USDPriceBuy, we use the USDpriceSell.
