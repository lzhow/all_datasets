   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python was created in  the late 8th century by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Van Rossaum wanted to create a new programming langugae that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. He named the language Python, after the Monty Python comedy group. Python is now maintained by an international team of volunteers, and is freely available under the Python Software Foundation License.

You could also start by using a python interpreter. These are programs that let you run python code without having to install python on your computer. This is great
