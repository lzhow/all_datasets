Label: yes

Reason: The variable `transferTokens` in the function `transferAllowed` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is meant to be called from outside the contract, typically by a user or another contract. The user calling this function will specify the value of `transferTokens`, which means this variable is controlled by the user.
