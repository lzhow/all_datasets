  
No, the `__ pendingAdmin ` variable in this function is uncontrolled by users.

The `__ pendinAdmin __` variable is a private variable that is declared in a function called `_setPendingImplemenationInternal`. This function sets the value of the pending admin variable to the address of a new implementation contract. However, this variable does not have any user-control input, and its value is determined by a series of internal calculations and conditions. Therefore, we can conclude that the __p endingAdmin__ variable  is an uncontrollable variable.
