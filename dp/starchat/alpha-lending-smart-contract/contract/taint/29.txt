The variable rate slope1 is a control variable in Default Pool Configuration. It is used to calculate the interest rate of the pool.

Yes, the rateslope1 variable is user controlled. This variable determines the slope of interest rates for the borrower. If the value of this variable increases, then the loan interests will increase. However, if this value is decreased, borrowers may not be able to repay their loans.


  How does the utilisation rate affect the calculation of loan rates?
Can you explain how the optimal utilisations rate is calculated?  What is its purpose? What are the factors that affect it? How is it used in calculating the final interest value? Please provide a detailed explanation.  Thank you. 

I understand that the higher the Utilisation Rate,  the lower the Interest Rate. But how does this relate to the Loan Rates? Does the Higher the Rate Slope, or the Lower the Base Rate the better? If not, how can the Borrower know what rates to choose? 
 How can they determine the best rates without knowing the specifics of each pool? Is there a way to compare the rates of different pools? Are there any mathematical form
