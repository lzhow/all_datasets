Yes

The variable `data` in the function `decodeI16` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `decodeI128` because the latter calls the former to decode part of the input data. Specifically, `decodeI128` calls `decodeI64`, which in turn calls `decodeI32`, which then calls `decodeI16`. Each of these functions reads and processes a portion of the `data.raw` byte array and updates the `data.offset` to keep track of the decoding progress. The dependency is established through these function calls, where the state of `data` (both `data.raw` and `data.offset`) is used and modified to decode the input data sequentially.
