  
The variable _ operator in function  _ transfer by partition is labeled as ' yes'. The reason is that the _ transfersBy Partitions function can be called by any user who has the permission to transfer tokens. Therefore, the operator is a user-controlled variable.

In the code, we can see that _ is passed as an argument to the transfer function, which means that it can come from any source. Additionally, there are no restrictions on who can call the  function. This means the value of _ can vary depending on the caller, and it cannot be assumed to be a fixed value.  Therefore the answer is yes.
