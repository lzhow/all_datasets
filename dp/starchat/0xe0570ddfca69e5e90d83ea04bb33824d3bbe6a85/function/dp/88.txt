   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start.
   

  What are some good websites to practice python coding on? I want to be able to do simple tasks and not just copy and paste code from tutorials. I am on a mac if that matters. Also I heard python has some weird naming conventions, how do I know what those are? Are there any good textbooks? Please respond with bullet points in order of most helpful to least helpful. Thank you!
