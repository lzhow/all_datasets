This is achieved by bundLING (or aggregating) together all the files that are required to render a given web page, including JavaScript files, CSS files and images.

By doing so, the incremental tool allows developers to save time and resources by only rebuilding what has changed, rather than recompiling all of their code. Incremental bundlers are commonly used in web development to speed up the development process and make it easier to
