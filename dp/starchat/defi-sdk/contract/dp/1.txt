yes, it is.

The reason is that the `swap` function in `UniviswaV3` contract takes two parameters `uint amount_in` and ` uint amount out`.
If the first parameter is  `0`, it means that we want to swap all the token in this pair. In this case, the second parameter ` amount  out` is dependent on ` reserve in`.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  The `callBytes` method in Univ3Caller contract calls the swap function of the Unipool contract. This swap method takes in two arguments: `input_amount` (the amount of input token to be swapped) and the address of `output_token`. The input_amout is determined by the get_input function, which takes the amount output token that is desired and compares it to the reserves of each token pair in unipools.
