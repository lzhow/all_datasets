The variable _ allowances is a mapping of addresses to mappings of other addresses and uint 2 5 6 values. It is created in line 30 of the code.  It does not appear to be controlled directly by a user, as it does  not have any user input. Instead, the values are set in lines 40 and 74 of code, which are part of functions that are called by other functions. These functions are not directly called from user inputs.
