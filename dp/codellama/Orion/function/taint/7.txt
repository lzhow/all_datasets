  
No, the ` input Ind` variable in function `_swapcurve` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and it can't be modified by any external user or attacker.

The ` _ swapCurves` function takes in several parameters, including `curfactory`, `amount`, and `path`, which are all controlled and validated by other functions in this contract. Therefore, any changes to the value of `InputInd ` would be done by a trusted function within the contract, and not by an external attack.
