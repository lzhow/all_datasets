  
The variable 'sender implementation' in function '_callpreTransfersHooKs' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the value of the 'from' parameter is passed to the interface address function, which is a user-controlled value. Therefore, the address of 'IAmp Tokens Sender' implementation is also user controlled.

In the same way, 'recipentImplemenation' variable in '_calPosttransfershooks' function can also be labled as "Yes" because the '_to' value is used to call the "interfaceAddrs" function.
