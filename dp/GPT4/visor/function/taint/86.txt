The variable _ total supply is a state variable in a smart contract. It is defined in line 21 as a mapping from address (the address of the account holder) to a S snap shots struct. This struct contains two arrays, ids and values, which are used to store the snap shot IDs and the corresponding balances of each account.  The _ updateTotal Supply S nap shot function is called in lines 73 and 81 to update the total balance of all accounts. Therefore, the _Total supply variable is updated by a function that is internal to the contract and not by any user input.
