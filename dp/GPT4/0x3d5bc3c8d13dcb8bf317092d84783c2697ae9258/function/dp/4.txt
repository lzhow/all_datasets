Reason: The variable `result` in the function `borrowBalanceStored` is determined by the return value of the function `borrowBalanceStoredInternal(account)`. It does not depend on any external state changes or variables outside of its scope. On the other hand, the variable `repayAmount` in the function `repayBorrowInternal` is a parameter that is used within that function to calculate the repayment of a borrow. There is no direct relationship or data flow between `repayAmount` and `result` as shown in the provided code snippet. They are used in separate functions and there is no indication that the result of `repayBorrowInternal` affects the state that would be read by `borrowBalanceStoredInternal`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
