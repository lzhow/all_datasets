Yes, they're semantic equivalent. In C, the code is executed from top to bottom. The code has the exact same outcome given exactly thesame inputs.

In the provided diff, however, it can be seen that the mutations are only at lines 6-7 and 8-9 in the `Mutated Code`. These small changes do not change the output of the program. That is, in both the original code as well as the mutated code, `a`, `b`, and `c` are treated as `unsigned ints`.
