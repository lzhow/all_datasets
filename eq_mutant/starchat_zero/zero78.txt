In C, the % operator always returns the remainder of a division operation. In this code, `upper--` may result in `0` if `bound` equals `data[(first+last)/2]` or `(first-last+1)/ 3`. In Java, `%` returns only the reminder of the integer division if both numbers are positive. Since this is not the case, in this mutated version, Java has changed the condition to be more permissive.
