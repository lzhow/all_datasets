No, the variable `amount1Out` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `input`. 

Explanation: The variable `amount1Out` is assigned the value of `amountOut` if `input` is equal to `token0`, otherwise it is assigned the value of `0`. The value of `input` is determined by the loop variable `i` and the `path` array. However, the value of `amount1Out` does not depend on the value of `input` itself, but rather on the condition `input == token0`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the two variables.
