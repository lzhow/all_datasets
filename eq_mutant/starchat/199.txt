No. Although they look functionally equivalent in a text comparison, their intended effects are different and therefore the code is not semantic equivalent. It is important to only compare semantic and functional equivalence when verifying the correctness of code, especially when working with complex or high-level languages. Here, for example, "a++" does not necessarily increment a by 4 as the text implies because of the way it is interpreted in the C programming language, where a++ is shorthand for a+=1.
