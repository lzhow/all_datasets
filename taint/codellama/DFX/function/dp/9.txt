Explanation:
In the first function, the `OriginSwpData _ swapData;` variable is declared and initialized with the `_origin`, `_target`, and `_ originAmount` parameters. This variable stores the data that is used to perform the swap.
Then, in line 10, `Swaps . origin Swap` is called with `curves` and ` _ Swp Data` as parameters, which returns the value of ` target Amount _`.
This means that the` targetAmout _` variable in function` originSwa`p is data-dependent on` _Sw pData`.
