Explanation: The variable `b` in the function `get_y` is calculated based on the values of `S_` and `D`, which are derived from the input parameters and internal calculations within the function. There is no direct user input or external interaction that controls the value of `b`. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if `b` is controlled by the user based on the given code snippet.
