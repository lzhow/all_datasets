  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_pool` variable is assigned the value of `balance()`, which is a function call. This means that the `uint265 _ pool` is dependent on `msg .sender` and `address( this )`.
Similarly, in function 2, `want(). safeTransfferfrom( msg. sender,address ( this ), _ amount)` is called, which means ` _ after` depends on `_ amount`. Therefore, `_ after ` is data-dependent on` _  amount` .
Therefore, we can conclude that `_ _ _`is data -dependent`_ _ `on` `_  after`.
