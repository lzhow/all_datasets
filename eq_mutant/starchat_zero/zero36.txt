In general, the codes above are **not** semanticaly equal, as they differ in several places:

- In the `quicksort` function of the first code, there is an extra incrementation of `first` on the third line, while in the second code this is not present. This affects the behaviour of this recursive call to `qsort`.
This makes the output of both codes non-deterministic.
So, according to the definition of semantic equality, these two programs are different in their behaviour and output.
