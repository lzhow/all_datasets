Reason: The variable `tickUpper` in the function `_updatePosition` is an input parameter that represents an upper tick value for a position within the contract. It is used to identify a specific position and to calculate fee growth inside a tick range, among other things.

On the other hand, the variable `amount` in the function `mint` represents the amount of liquidity that a user wants to mint. It is used to calculate the amounts of tokens to be minted and to interact with the mint callback function.

There is no direct data flow or computational dependency between `tickUpper` and `amount` as they are used for different purposes within their respective functions. `tickUpper` is related to the position's range within the contract, while `amount` is related to the liquidity being added to the contract. The two variables operate independently within their functions and do not influence each other's values. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
