  
No, the ` dy` variable in get Amount Out Curve function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameters and the state of the contract.

The `getAmount OutCurves` function takes in three parameters: `factory`, `from`, and `to`. It then calculates the amount of tokens that can be exchanged for a given amount in a curve pool. This calculation is based solely on these input values and does not involve any user input. Therefore, `Dy` is also not user-controlled.
