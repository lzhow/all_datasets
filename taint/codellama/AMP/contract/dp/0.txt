  
No, the ` from PartitionsValidator Implementation ` variable in `_ callPre TransferHoo ks` is not dependent on ` _ from partitionPrefix ` in ` `_ _ call Pre Transfer Hooks`.

The `PartionUtils` library is used to get the partition prefix from the `_frompartition` variable. However, this library does not modify the value of `Frompartitionprefix` or any other variable, so it doesnot affect the data dependence of the`frompartitonvalidatorimplementation`variable.
Therefore, ` Frompartitionvalidatormplementation is independent of Frompartionprefix.
