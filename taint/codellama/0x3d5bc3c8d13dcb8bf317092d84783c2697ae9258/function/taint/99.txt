  
No, the `sub_` function does not take any user input, so the value of `b` is determined by internal logic and is therefore not under the control of the end user of this contract.

The `add_`, `mul_ `, and `div_ functions are all pure functions that take two or more arguments and return the result of a mathematical operation on those arguments. These functions do not have any external inputs, such as user inputs or external data, that could be used to control the behavior of these functions. Therefore, these variables are not considered to be under user control.
