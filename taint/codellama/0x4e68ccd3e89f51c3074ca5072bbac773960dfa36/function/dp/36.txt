The variable tick is a parameter of the `_updatePostion` function, and it is not modified within the scope of this function. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on any other variable, including `liqudity`.
Similarly, `Amount` is also a function parameter, but it does not affect the value of `ticks` within `_ updatePosition`. Therefore it can't be a dependency.
