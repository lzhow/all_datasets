In the `calculateRoudUpLiqidtySharAmount` function, the local variable  `Pool storage` is defined. This variable is initialized with the value of the global variable poo[]. The `pools` array is a mapping of addresses to `Pools`. The address of `_toke`n is used to index into the array and retrieve the corresponding ` Pool` object.
  The local ` pool` variable in ` calculate RoundUp LiquiditShardAmount ` is data-dependent on ` _ token` because it is assigned the same value as the `_ token ` variable. Therefore, any changes to the state of ` poole[ address(_ token)]` will also affect the  state  of  the` pool `variable.
