  
No, the `` variable in function ``_setpendingimplementation`` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can only be modified by a function call.

The `` _ setPendinImplemenation`` function is called by an external user, but the value of the local ``newPedingImplementaion`` variable is set by calling the funtion ``fusAdmin`` and passing the current ``comtrollerimplemntation``.
