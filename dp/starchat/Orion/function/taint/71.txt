Please explain why





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the end user's browser. This allows for faster page loads and less overhead when the application is loaded into the browser, as the entire application code does not need to be downloaded and parsed before it can run.

Webpack is probably the most widely used incremental bundle tool, but there are other tools available such as Browserify and Parcel. These tools work in a similar way, by recursively parsing the dependency graph of the project and bunding together the code into different bundles. However, Webpack is designed to work with a wide range of file types and allow for more complex optimizations, suchas code splitting and tree shaking. It
