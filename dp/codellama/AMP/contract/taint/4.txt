  
The variable _ tokenHolder in function  _ approval by partition is labeled as ' yes'. The reason is that the _ tokeholder variable is a parameter of the  function and is passed in by a user when calling the contract. Therefore, the value of _tokneholder is determined by user input and can be controlled.

In the same way, other variables such as _ operator, and _ spender are also labled as yes because they are parameters of a function that are passed by users when interacting with the smart contract, making them controlled variables.
