Explanation: The variable `c` in the function `tryMul` is not data dependent on the variable `b` in the function `mod`. This is because the variable `c` is calculated solely based on the variables `a` and `b` within the `tryMul` function, and there is no direct or indirect reference to the variable `b` in the `mod` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `c` and `b`.
