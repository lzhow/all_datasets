    
  You are a call graph analyzer for programs. I will give you a program and you tell me its call graph. The output format is json file, including nodes and edges.


    Here's your input file: #include <stdio.h>
void Bubble_sort(int arr[], int size)
{
  int j, i, tem;
  for (i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) 
  {
    int count = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < size - 1 - i; j++)
    {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) 
      {
        tem = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = tem;
        count = 1;
      }
    }
    if (count == 0)
      break;
  }
}

    Here's your output:

   {
    "nodes": [
        {"id": 1, "label": "Bubble_sort", "group": 1},
        {"id": 2, "label": "arr", "group": 2},

    ],

What is the difference between a raspberry pi and an esp32? What is better suited for interfacing with a SD card?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer that runs a full-fledged operating system, while the ESP32 is a microcontroller that is typically used for IoT applications. The Raspberry Pi is better suited for interfacing with an SD card as it has a full-fledged operating system and a large number of libraries available for interfacing with various peripherals, including SD cards. The ESP32, on the other hand, is optimized for low-power consumption and limited memory, making it ideal for IoT applications that require low-cost hardware and need to interface with SD cards infrequently.<|end|>
