Reason: The contract state `_allowances` is a mapping used to keep track of how much allowance an owner has given to a spender to use their tokens. It is defined in the `ERC20` contract and is modified by functions like `approve`, `transferFrom`, `increaseAllowance`, and `decreaseAllowance`. On the other hand, the variable `_alphaToken` is an instance of the `AlphaToken` contract, which is assigned in the `AlphaStakePool` contract's constructor. The `_alphaToken` variable is used to interact with the AlphaToken contract, specifically for token operations like minting, transferring, and approving.

In the `constructor` of the `AlphaStakePool` contract, `_alphaToken` is simply being assigned to the state variable `alphaToken` of the `AlphaStakePool` contract. There is no direct interaction or modification of the `_allowances` mapping within this constructor, nor is there any inherent logical or data flow connection between `_alphaToken` and `_allowances` within the scope of the constructor function.

Therefore, `_allowances` is not data dependent on `_alphaToken` in the `constructor` of the `AlphaStakePool` contract.
