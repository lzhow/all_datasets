   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same problems and want to be able to do more than just copy and paste code from the internet. I have heard that the best way is to just start coding and see where it takes you. Is that a bad idea? Should I be looking for other ways to improve my skills? Please help me understand what I need to focus on and what resources I should use. Thank you!




I think you should start with the official Python tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

It's a very good place to start.
If you want more advanced tutorials, you can look at the "Python for Beginners" playlist on Youtube:

These tutorials are more beginner-friendly and cover a lot of ground. They are not as comprehensive as the Python documentation
