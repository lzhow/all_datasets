  
No, the variables `_before` and `_pool` are dependent on each other in function  `depost()` but not on `_amount` or `_sharess` .

The variable  `_poo` is calculated by calling the `balanace()` function, which returns the current balance of the vaule.
Then, `_befor`e is calcuated by subtracting the `_poll` from `wanth(). balanceof( address (this))`.
This means that the value of `_bfore` depends on ` _polo` but does not depend on any other variable.
