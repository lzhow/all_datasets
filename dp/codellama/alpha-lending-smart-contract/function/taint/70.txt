The variable 'value' in function 'decode I1 2  is a local variable that is created by calling the 'Data' struct constructor. It is initialized with the value of the data parameter, which is passed to the decode I  function. Since the constructor is called internally, the initial value is determined by other factors, such as the input data and the offset. Therefore, ' value' is uncontrolled by user input.
