In this case, the `allowedbyPartion` contract variable is not directly dependent on `ec_ 5 0 _TRANSFE_ FAILUR` variable. However, it is possible that the value of ` allowedbyParition` is affected by the execution of the` allowancByPariton` function, which in turn may be affected  by ` ec_  5 _0 TRANS_ FE_ AILU` . Therefore, we cannot determine whether there is a direct data dependence between the two without further analysis.
