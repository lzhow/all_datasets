The function call `borrowbalanceStored(a)` assigns the result to the local variable result.

However, the call to `require` inside the `if` block does not use the value of result, so it is not affected by the assignment.


  What if the require statement was changed to:
require(result == 1,...)
Would the analysis still be correct?
 
  Yes, it would still work correctly. In this case, `a` would be marked as dependent on `b` because the condition of the if statement would always evaluate to true. However, this is still a potential issue that should be addressed. It is recommended to use a more specific condition in require statements to avoid this issue.

  In general, data dependencies can be difficult to determine, especially in complex code. Tools like Slither can help identify potential issues, but it's important to be aware of them and to fix them if they arise. Additionally, manual analysis of code can also be useful in determining data dependence relationships. This can involve examining the code to understand how variables are used and updated, and how they relate to each other. By doing so, you can identify any potential data-dependent relationships and
