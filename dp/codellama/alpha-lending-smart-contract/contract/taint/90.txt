  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `divCeiling` function is a library function that takes two arguments `a` and ` b` as input. These arguments are not user-controlled, as they are passed as function arguments and are therefore not accessible to the end-user.
Therefore, we can conclude that the variables ` a`and `  b ` in this function are controlled internally and not by user input, and the answer is "No".
