In the given code, the `permit` function is a public function that takes in several parameters, including `owner`, `spender`, and `value`. The `nonce` parameter is used to prevent replay attacks, and it should be generated by a trusted source, such as a blockchain node.
However, in this code snippet, there is no clear indication of where the non-ce is generated or how it's used. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the value of ` hash` is under the control of the end-user.
