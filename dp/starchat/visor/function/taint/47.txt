  How can I prevent this?  Is there a way to make the code in Solidty more secure?   Can you give me a list of best practices for writing secure smart contracts?    Can I use a static code analysis tools to find these kinds of issues?     Can the use of a tool like Slither help me find the kinds issues I'm looking for?      Can a combination of tools help find all kinds kinds security issues in my Soliditty code?       Can Solidly code be automatically tested for security vulnerabilities?        Can an automated tool be used to fix security vulnerability in a Solidiy code base?         Can solidity code automatically be deployed to a testnet or mainnet?          Can smart contract developers be trusted to not make mistakes that could lead them to lose millions of dollars?           Can developers of smart contrats be held account
