Label: no

Reason: The variable `a` in the function `lte` is not data dependent on the variable `target` in the function `observeSingle`. In the context of data dependency, one variable is data dependent on another if the value of one variable affects the value of the other. In this case, `a` is a parameter of the function `lte` and its value is determined by the arguments passed to it at the call site within the `binarySearch` function. The variable `target` in `observeSingle` is used within that function and passed to other functions, but there is no direct relationship or data flow from `target` to `a` that would constitute a data dependency. The value of `a` is independent of the value of `target` as they are used in separate functions and their values are provided by the respective callers of those functions.
