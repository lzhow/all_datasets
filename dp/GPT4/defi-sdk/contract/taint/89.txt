Reason: The visibility of the `getBalance` function is `internal`, which means it can only be called from within the contract itself or from derived contracts, not directly by an external user. However, without seeing the rest of the contract, it's impossible to determine how this function is being used and whether external users can influence the `token` parameter indirectly through other public or external functions that call `getBalance`. If there are public or external functions that accept a `token` parameter from the user and pass it to `getBalance`, then the `token` variable could be considered user-controlled. If the contract only uses predefined tokens within its logic to call `getBalance`, then the `token` variable would not be user-controlled. Since the provided code snippet does not include the context of how `getBalance` is called, the control over the `token` variable cannot be definitively classified without additional information.
