  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `function` ` getAmoutInUniveral`, the variables `factory`, ` factorytype`,`from`, and `to` are passed as arguments.
However, the argument `amount` is not passed in this function.  The variable`i`, which is used in ` function` get AmountIn Curve, is defined in` function  getamountIncurve` as `(int 218i,int220j)  =ICurveregistry( factory). getcoindindicies( pool,from ,to);`.
This means that the value of ` i` depends on ` from` and` to`.  Therefore, `I`is data-dependent on` from`.
