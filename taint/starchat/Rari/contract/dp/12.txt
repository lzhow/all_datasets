Please explain why






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python" is pronounced like the English word "benevolent".
The Python logo is based on a snake and the word is meant to evoke the idea of a Pythonic value system.
   
I'm not sure what you mean by "high-lever".

   
What is high level language? What are low level languages? And what is machine code? I'm confused. I've heard that Python is interpreted but I thought it was compiled. Can you explain it to me like I know how computers work? Please. Thank you. 

  
A highâ€“level language is closer to the metal of the computer, closer in abstraction to assembly language, and closer (in some cases) to natural languages. A low- or machine language has a closer relationship to binary code, the actual instructions that the processor can execute. Machine code can be difficult
