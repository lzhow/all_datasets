Yes

The variable `tickHi` in the function `getTickAtSqrtRatio` is data dependent on the variable `r` in the same function. The reason for this is that `tickHi` is calculated using the value of `log_sqrt10001`, which in turn is calculated using the value of `log_2`. The value of `log_2` is derived from a series of operations on the variable `r`. The variable `r` is manipulated through a series of bit-shifting operations and multiplications, which directly influence the final value of `log_2`. Since `tickHi` is computed based on `log_sqrt10001`, which depends on `log_2`, and `log_2` depends on `r`, there is a clear data dependency chain from `r` to `tickHi`.
