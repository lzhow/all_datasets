  
The variable _`from `in the `_remove TokenFrom Partitions` function in this contract is labeled as 'Yes'. This is because the ` _ from `variable is derived from the` _ operator `argument in that function, which is passed in by a user-controlled variable. Therefore, the value of`_ from`is also user controlled.

In this function `_transerBy Partion`, the argument `_operator` is also passed by user, and it's used to check the authorization of the operator. So, `_ operator` and `_ from`, both are user control variables.
