  
No, the variables ` to` and ` balance  Adjust` are independent.

The variable  `  to ` is a parameter of the `_safe Transfer` function, which is called within the ` swap`function. It is not dependent on any other variable in ` _ safe Transfer`.
On the other hand, `Balance  adjusted `is a local variable within `Swap` that is calculated based on `reserves`and `amounts` passed to the`Swaps` method. However, it is only used to calculate the new ` reserves `and is never used as an input to any function call. Therefore, there is no data dependence between ` Balance Adj` ` and` to`.
