In the `function transfer` of the given contract, the `_transerByDefualtPartion` function is called, which is a function of another contract. This function takes in 5 parameters: `_from`, `_to`, `value`, and `data`. The `msg` variable is used to pass the sender's address as the first parameter, and the second parameter is `_sender`, which refers to the address of whoever is calling the transfer function.
  The third parameter `_recipient` is set to `_receiver`, the fourth parameter `amount`is set as `_amount`,and the fifth parameter`data` has a default value of an empty string.  This means that the value passed to ` _balance` will be the same as ` msg .sender` and `_ value`.
   Therefore, `_ balances ` is data-dependent on `_ amount` because the two values are related.
