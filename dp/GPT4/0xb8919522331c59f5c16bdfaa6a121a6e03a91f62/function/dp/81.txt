In the ` functionfunctionCallwithValue` function, the` value` variable is passed as an argument to the target contract's `call` method. This means that the value of ` value ` is determined by the caller of the contract and is not dependent on any other variable or state in this contract.
On the other hand, in `FunctionDelegatecall`, the argument `data` is also passed to `target. delegatecall`. However, this does not mean that ` data` depends on ` target`. The `delegateCall` call is a low-level call that does no additional checks or modifications to its arguments, so the data passed in is simply passed on to another contract without any changes. Therefore, `Data` and `Target` are independent variables and states, and there is no data dependence between them.
