Reason: The variable `pool` in the function `setPoolStatus` is data dependent on the variable `_token` in the function `repayInternal` because both functions reference the same mapping `pools` with the address of the ERC20 token (`_token`) as the key. In `setPoolStatus`, `pool` is a storage pointer to the `Pool` struct in the `pools` mapping for the given `_token`. Similarly, in `repayInternal`, another storage pointer to the `Pool` struct within the same `pools` mapping is retrieved using the address of `_token`. Any changes to the `Pool` struct's state for a specific `_token` in `setPoolStatus` will affect the state of the `Pool` struct that is referenced in `repayInternal` for the same `_token`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `pool` in `setPoolStatus` and `_token` in `repayInternal` because the state of `pool` is determined by the specific `_token` used to index into the `pools` mapping.
