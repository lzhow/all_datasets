The variable "to" in function "skim" is a user-controlled variable. It is used to specify the recipient of the skimmable tokens. Since the "msg" variable contains the address of whoever is calling the current function, the value of "this" can be assumed to be the owner of these tokens, and the intended recipient is therefore the msg sender.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiy





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

In combinatorial mathematics, a J-P-Perm P LL algorithm is any algorithm that solves the Juggling Problem for up to J people, where each person has a different number of objects to juggle, all of which are permutations of a fixed set of items, in a way that minimizes the total number swaps.
Jugglers are allowed to swap objects with each other, but not with themselves. Each juber has an initial configuration of jumbled objects, which is represented as a permutation of all the objects. Jumbles are represented by a pair of indices into the permutation, indicating the positions of two objects that are sw
