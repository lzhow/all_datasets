In the `function pairfor` function, the local variable 'pair' is assigned the value returned by the 'getpair()' function of the Iorionpoolv2factory interface. This interface is passed as an argument to the getpair function.
On the other hand, in `the function getamountsin`, the argument 'factory' of type address is used as the first argument of getPair function in pair for function call. Therefore, pair and factory are dependent on each other.
