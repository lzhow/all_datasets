Explanation: The variable `cToken` in the function `redeemVerify` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, and its value is determined by the caller of the function. Without further information about how the `redeemVerify` function is called and where the value of `cToken` comes from, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not.
