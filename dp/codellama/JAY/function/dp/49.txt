  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_sellerNtfFfeEht` variable is assigned a value based on `_pric`e, which is a parameter of the `latestroundData` function. Therefore, `_pscope_ 0_` is data-dependent on`_price`.
Similarly, in function  `updatFeess`, the` _buynftfeeeth`variable is also assigned basedon`price`, making it datadependent.
Therefore, both variables are dependent on `price.`
