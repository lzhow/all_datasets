  
No, the state variable `_ symbol` is not dependent on ` er c1 5 6Ids`.

The reason is that the `_ symbols` state is initialized in a constructor and is never updated again. It is a constant value that is set when the smart contract is deployed.
On the other hand, `er c 7 3 4Ids`, which is an array of token IDs, is passed as an argument to the ` buy Jay` function. This means that it is possible for the value of ` _symbols` to change based on different inputs to this function, but it does not depend on any specific value in `ERc 8 9  Ids`. Therefore, it can be considered as independent.
