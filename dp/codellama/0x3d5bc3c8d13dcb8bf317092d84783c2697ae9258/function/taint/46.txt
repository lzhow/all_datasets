  
The variable 'dst' in function 'transferAllow' is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user who calls the transfer function.

In the code, the 'src' variable is passed as an argument to the `transerAllow` function, which means that the value of ' src' can come from the caller of the contract. Therefore, ' dst' could also be influenced by user input.
