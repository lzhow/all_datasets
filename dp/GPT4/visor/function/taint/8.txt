The variable `account` in the function `balanceOfAt` is an input parameter provided by the caller of the function. Since the caller can be any user interacting with the contract, the value of `account` is indeed controlled by the user. The function is designed to query the balance of a specific account at a particular snapshot in time, and the user specifies which account's balance they are interested in checking.
