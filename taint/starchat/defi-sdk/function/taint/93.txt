An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the amount of time it takes to build and deploy web pages. Incremental bundlers work by incrementally updating the portions of a web page that have changed since the last time the page was bundled. This allows the bundl to only rebundle the parts of code that changed, rather than rebuilding the entire application.
Some examples of incremental web bundlings include:
- Webpack
Webpack is probably the most popular incremental bundle tool. Webpack takes in entry points, which are the main files that the application needs to load, and recursively processes all the dependencies of those files, creating a graph of modules. Then it uses various loaders and plugins to transform and optimize each module, before outputting a single
