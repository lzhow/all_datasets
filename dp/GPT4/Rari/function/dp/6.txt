Explanation: 

The variable `exchangeRateMantissa` in the function `getAccountSnapshot` is not directly dependent on the variable `currentBlockNumber` in the function `accrueInterest`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `currentBlockNumber` in the code snippet provided for `getAccountSnapshot`. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a data dependency relationship between these two variables based on the given code.
