The variable `id` in the function `onERC1155Received` is not data dependent on the variable `data` in the same function. 

Reason: The variable `id` is used as a parameter in the function `onERC1155Received` and its value is determined by the caller of the function. On the other hand, the variable `data` is also a parameter in the same function and its value is determined by the caller. There is no direct assignment or computation between these two variables within the function, so they are not data dependent.
