The variable `outputInd` in the function `_swapCurve` is assigned the value of `outputInd` in the line `address pool = OrionMultiPoolLibrary.pairForCurve(curFactory, input, output);`. However, without further information about the implementation of `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.pairForCurve`, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between `outputInd` and `output`.
