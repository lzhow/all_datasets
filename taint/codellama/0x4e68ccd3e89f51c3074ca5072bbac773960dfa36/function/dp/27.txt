In the first function, the `if` statement checks if `protocolFeeses. token1 ` is greater than ` amount 1 requested`. If it is, then ` protocolFee.toke1n` is assigned to ` amoun1`. Otherwise `amoun  t1requested `is assigned.
Then, ` if` statements are used to check if the value of `token  is equal to the amount of token  requested. If so, it decreases the token by  one. Then,` protocolfees .token`is subtracted by the amout of the toke. Finally, a transfer is made to recipent.  The variable amount is data-dependent on amount requested because it uses the same variable.
