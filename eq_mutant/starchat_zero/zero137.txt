In both cases they seem to do the right thing, but with the ternary `if` replaced by a nonsensical tertiary operator `?` the code seems completely wrong. They also do not seemingly output the value of `3` for the correct input of all 5 `1`s, which is also an indication of incorrectness. Therefore the provided C code is not semantic equal to the mutant Java code provided.

Note that these are only simple examples of valid C and Java programs. The semantics of complex code can be very different in practice, depending on how they were written.
