The contract function `_mint` is not present in this code snippet, so I cannot answer your question. However, if I were to guess, I would say that the answer is "no", because the `_balance` variable is a local variable in that function, and it is never used after the call to `_transfer`.


  I am sorry, here is another example:

pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
contract C {
    mapping (address => uint) public balances;
    function withdraw(uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance.");
        balances[address(this)] += amount;
        return true;
     }
}






   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
    An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web pages by combining multiple files into a single file. This reduces the number of requests made to the server, which improves the page load time.
