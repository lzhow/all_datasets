  
No, the ` success` variable in function  ` sell` is not dependent on variable  'value' in  function 'sale'. The reason is that the  variable 'success' is a local variable that is defined within the scope of the ' sell' function, and it is only used to check the return status of a function call. It is therefore not possible for the value of ' success' to be affected by the input value ' value' of function's ' sale'.

The variable' 'dev'  is also not a dependent variable of variable value in ' buy' because it' s a private variable and is used only to store the address of an external contract.
