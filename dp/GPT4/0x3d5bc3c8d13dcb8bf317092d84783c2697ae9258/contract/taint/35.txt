Label: no

Reason: The variable `isPriceOracle` is declared as a `public constant` boolean with a value of `true`. Since it is a constant, its value is set at compile time and cannot be changed thereafter. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user at any point after the contract has been deployed. The `public` visibility allows it to be read by anyone, but it does not grant the ability to modify it.
