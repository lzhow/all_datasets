Explanation: The variable `bitPos` in the function `position` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is derived from the input parameter `tick`. The value of `bitPos` is calculated based on the modulo operation `tick % 256`, which is a deterministic computation and does not depend on any user input. Therefore, the variable `bitPos` is not controlled by the user.
