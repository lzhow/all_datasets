  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the ` functionfunctionCallwithValue` function, the` data` variable is passed as an argument to the low level call function. This means that the value of ` data ` is used as input to this function and is therefore data-dependent on ` `  data`.
On the other hand, in `FunctionStaticcall`, the data variable does not appear as a parameter, so it is not directly data - dependent on it.
However, it's important to note that ` FunctionStatic call` is a low - level function that calls another contract, and the input data is sent to that contract. Therefore, ` Data` can be considered data  -dependent  on  `Data` because the output of the called contract can affect the behavior of  the calling contract and therefore the state of` Data`.
