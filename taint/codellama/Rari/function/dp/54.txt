  
No, the variables `borrwoBalace` and `newBorroCAPs` are independent.

The reason is that the `liquidateborowAllow` function is called from the `_settMarkBorrrowCapps`function. Therefore, when the`_settMaketborrrrowcaps` is executed, it will update the value of ` newborrcaps`. However, this update will not affect the execution of the  `liqidatborrwallow`  function.  Therefore the two variable are indepenent.
