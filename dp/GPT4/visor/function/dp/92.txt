Reason: The variable `value` in the function `balanceOfAt` is used to store the result of `_valueAt` which is a function that retrieves the balance value at a specific snapshot for an account. This value is determined by the historical balance of the account at the given `snapshotId`, which is independent of the `amount` variable in the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function.

The `amount` variable in `_beforeTokenTransfer` represents the quantity of tokens being transferred in a transaction. While `_beforeTokenTransfer` does update account snapshots and total supply snapshots, it does not directly affect the historical snapshot values that `value` is dependent on. The snapshots are a record of the state at a particular point in time, and the `value` is retrieved based on a past state, not the current or future state changes that `_beforeTokenTransfer` might cause.

Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between `value` in `balanceOfAt` and `amount` in `_beforeTokenTransfer` as they operate on different states of the account balances.
