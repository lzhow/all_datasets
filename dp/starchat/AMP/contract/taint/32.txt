   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies.

 
   An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This makes it easier for the browser to load the application and makes the initial load time faster.

   The incremental part of the bundlers job is to only update the portions of code that have changed since the last time the bundle was generated. For example, if you are working on a React application, and you make a small change to a component, the incremental tool will only include the changed component in its bundle, rather than re-bundling the entire application.

Webpack is probably the most popular incremental web bundlere tool. It can take in multiple types of assets such as JavaScript, CSS, images, etc. and bundle them together into one or more bundles. These bundles can then be optimized
