Reason: The variable `cardinalityUpdated` in the `write` function is determined by the parameters `cardinality`, `cardinalityNext`, and `index`. It does not depend on the state of the `self` array or any of its elements. The `self` array in the `getSurroundingObservations` function is used to access and manipulate the `Observation` struct elements, but there is no direct data flow from `self` to `cardinalityUpdated`. The two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes within the contract, and there is no code path where `self` directly influences the value of `cardinalityUpdated`.
