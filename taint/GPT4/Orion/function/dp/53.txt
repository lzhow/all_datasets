Explanation: The variable `amountOut` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is data dependent on the variable `initialTransferSource` in the function `_doSwapTokens`. This is because the value of `amountOut` is calculated based on the balance of `initialTransferSource` after a series of operations in the `_doSwapTokens` function. Any change in the value of `initialTransferSource` will affect the final value of `amountOut`.
