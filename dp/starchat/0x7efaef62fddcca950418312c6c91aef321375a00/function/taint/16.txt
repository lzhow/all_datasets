   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all day.
  
   There are many ways to get started with Python. Here are some suggestions:

   1.) Start with the basics: If you're new to programming, you may want to start with basic programming concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals. These will help you get a solid foundation for writing code.

   2.) Learn from examples: Look for beginner-friendly Python projects that demonstrate specific programming techniques. For example, there are several online tutorials and courses that introduce you to the fundamentals of Python and walk you through building a simple web scraper. This can be a great way of learning by doing.

  3.) Join a community: There's a large and active community of people who are willing to help new programmers learn Python, including online forums, online communities, local meetups, etc. Joining a supportive community can make learning Python much easier.

 4.) Practice: Like any skill, learning to program requires practice. Start by writing small programs or scripts that solve simple problems. As you gain experience, gradually move on to more complex projects
