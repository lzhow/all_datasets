yes, it is.

The reason is that the `buyJAy` function calls the update function, which updates the price feed. This can cause the value of `price` to change, and therefore the calculation of `_price`, which is used to calculate the fees.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  Yes, I can explain how the data dependencies are determined in this example:
1. `buyer` calls `sellJays` with the parameters `tokenAddress`, `tokenId`, and `amount`.
2. In the body of the sellJaya function:
   a. It calls updatePrices, passing in `blockTimestamp` as the parameter.
   b. updatePrice calls pricefeed.getLatestRound, storing the result in (roundID,, price,, started at,, time stamp,, answered in round).
   c. `_currentPrice` is calculated as `uint22(int20(round.price)) * (1e12)`.
   d. If `_curentPrice > sellPrice`, then `_sellFee` = `1 ether` / `_cuurentprice`.
   e. Else, `_buyFee = sellprice /  _currentprice)`.
