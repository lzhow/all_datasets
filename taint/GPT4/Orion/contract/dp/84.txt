Yes

The variable `tokenA` in the function `_addLiquidity` is data dependent on the variable `amountADesired` in the same function. This is because `amountADesired` is used to calculate `amountA`, which is then used in the conditional logic to determine the final values of `amountA` and `amountB`. The `amountADesired` variable influences the outcome of these calculations and thus has a data dependency relationship with `tokenA`, as the liquidity added involves the `tokenA` and the amount of it to be added is derived from `amountADesired`.
