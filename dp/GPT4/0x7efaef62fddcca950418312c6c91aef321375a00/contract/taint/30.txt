Reason: The variable `token1` in the `PancakePair` contract is set during the execution of the `initialize` function, which can only be called by the `factory` contract (as enforced by the `require(msg.sender == factory, 'Pancake: FORBIDDEN');` statement). Since the `factory` address is set to `msg.sender` in the constructor of the `PancakePair` contract and the constructor can only be executed once when the contract is deployed, the `initialize` function can only be called by the account that deployed the `PancakePair` contract. This means that `token1` is not directly controlled by an arbitrary user, but rather by the deployer or the entity that controls the `factory` contract. After the initial setup, `token1` cannot be changed, so it is not user-controlled.
