The variable ETH is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled. It is used to represent the native cryptocurrency ether, which is also not under the control of the end user in a smart contract.


  What is an example of a user controlled variable?  What about a contract controlled one?

I'm trying to understand the difference between a variable that is user or smart-contract controlled.  Can you explain to me the key differences between these two types of variables?  

Are there any examples of smart contracts that use both types? If so, can you provide me with some examples? 

Thank you for your help. I'm looking to better understand how to write secure smart contacts. 
 I appreciate your time and consideration.
Can you please provide some additional information on the differences? I would like to know if there are any other types or examples. Thank you.


Is there a difference in how these variables are handled? For example, are there differences in their scope, visibility, and lifetime? Are there restrictions on how they can be used? Can they be modified or updated? How are they secured? What are their limitations? Is there anything else I should know about them? Please provide detailed information about
