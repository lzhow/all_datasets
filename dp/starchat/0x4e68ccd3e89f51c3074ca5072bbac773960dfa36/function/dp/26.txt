   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many resources available to help you learn Python. Here are some suggestions:

   1. Start with the official Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

   2. Coursera offers a course on Python:https://www.courser<EMAIL>

   3. Udemy offers several courses on programming and Python

   4. Khan Academy offers an excellent course called "Intro to Python for Data Science"

   5. Codecademy is another great resource, offering a series of courses in Python

   Once you have completed a few courses, you may want to move on to more advanced courses. Some suggestions for these include:

   - "Python for Everybody" by University of Michigan

   Or

   "Advanced Python" on Udacity

   These courses will take you further than the beginner courses and will help build your Python skills further. Good luck!
