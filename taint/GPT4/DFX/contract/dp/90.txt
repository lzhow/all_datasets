The variable `__deposit` in the function `viewProportionalDeposit` is data dependent on the variable `_oGLiq` in the same function. This is because the value of `_oGLiq` influences the calculation of `_multiplier`, which is then used to determine the value of `deposits_` array elements. The `_multiplier` is calculated as `__deposit.div(_oGLiq)`, and this calculation directly involves both `__deposit` and `_oGLiq`. If `_oGLiq` is zero, the function would behave differently, but since there is a check for `_oGLiq == 0` before this calculation, we can infer that `_oGLiq` is not zero when this calculation takes place. Therefore, the value of `__deposit` is used in a calculation that also includes `_oGLiq`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
