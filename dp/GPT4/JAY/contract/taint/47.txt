The variable `_price` in the function `updateFees` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `_price` is obtained from the `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` function, which retrieves the latest price from an external data source. The user does not have control over this external data source, so the value of `_price` is not controlled by the user.
