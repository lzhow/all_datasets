The contract variable `_msgsender()` is a low-level function that retrieves the address of the account that sent the current call or transaction. It is not a state variable and does not directly affect the behavior of `decreseAllownace`.

However, the `_approve()` function is called within `deceraseAllowence`, which modifies the state of `_alowances`. Therefore, it is concluded that `_allows` is data-dependent on `subtractdValue`.


  Can you explain how the tool works in more detail?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain in detail how my tool analyzes Solidiy contract codes and classifies data dependencies.
My tool uses a combination of automated analysis and manual review to identify data dependence relationships between variables and contract  states. I start by analyzing the code to extract all the variables, functions, and modifiers used in  the smart contract. Then, for each variable,  I look for assignments to the  variable in each function and modifier. If the assignment occurs within a conditional statement or loop, then I check if the assigned value depends on any of  its dependencies or on other variables. For example, if a variable is assigned a value that
