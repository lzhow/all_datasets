The variable high is data-dependent on mid in findLowerBound because the loop in that function depends on it. Specifically, the high variable is used to determine the stopping condition for the while loop, and the value of high depends directly on how many elements are in array, which is determined by the length variable.


  Can you explain how the data dependence is derived?
 
  Sure! The data dependencies in this code snippet are derived from the loops and comparisons within the functions.

In the findLowwerBound function, there is a while-loop that iterates over the array until it finds the correct index where the element should be inserted. This loop depends upon the mid variable, as the condition of the if-statement depends only on array elements before the current mid index. Therefore, it can be inferred that the elements after the index mid are also relevant for determining the insertion point. Similarly, in function  findUppeBound, since the comparison in line 20 depends solely on elements up to and including the currently considered mid element, all elements preceding the considered index are relevant. Thus, both functions have data flow dependencies on their mid variables.


However, this is just one possible analysis of data
