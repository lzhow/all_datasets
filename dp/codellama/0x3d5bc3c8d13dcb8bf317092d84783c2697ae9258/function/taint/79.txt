  
The variable 'scaler' in function 'divScaler is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user input.

In the code, the 'mulScalr' function takes in a 'Exp' memory and a scalar as parameters. This means that the scalar can come from a malicious user and can cause an overflow or underfow in 'exp' if it's too large or too small.
