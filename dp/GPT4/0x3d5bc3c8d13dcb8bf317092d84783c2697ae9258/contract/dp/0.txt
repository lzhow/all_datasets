Label: no

Reason: In the function `_setPendingImplementation`, the variable `newPendingImplementation` is used to set the state variable `pendingComptrollerImplementation`. However, the state variable `comptrollerImplementation` is not modified or used in any way within this function. The only interaction with `comptrollerImplementation` occurs in the `_acceptImplementation` function, where it is set to the value of `pendingComptrollerImplementation` after a series of checks. Since `comptrollerImplementation` is not directly dependent on the variable `newPendingImplementation` within the scope of the `_setPendingImplementation` function, they do not have a data dependency relationship in this context.
