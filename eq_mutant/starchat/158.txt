No. I'm afraid the given pair of codes provided is not sematically equal in both C and Java programming languages. 

In C language, `abs()` function is defined as `long int abs(long x)`. Therefore the expression `i - 4 0 9 5 6 7 * .  *  0 *`  results in a value that has different sign than the value of `4294966784`. This could result in different outputs for different values of i. For example:
`i = -4` -> `bonus = bonus  + ((-  -   4 ) *   0.  3 ) =  4.   6`
 ` i = +4 ` ->  ` bonus =bonus +  ((+  --4) *     0  .    3) =   8.6 `
Therefore, these two statements are considered different, while they may have identical outputs. This means that these codes do not have semantical equivalence in terms of C programming language. 


While in Java, there are no direct equivalents to C++ `std::abs` function or C `labs`. However, we can still use similar
