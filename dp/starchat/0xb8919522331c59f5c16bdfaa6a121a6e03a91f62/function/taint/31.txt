Since this value can be set by a malicious user, the control flow of this function can depend on the value stored in success. Therefore, success is considered to be controlled indirectly by user input.


  Can you explain how the code works? I am specifically looking for the part where the `staticCall` is made. Can explain it in simple terms.

Finally, I would appreciate it if you could provide
