Explanation: The variable `startedAt` in the function `getLatestPrice` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the value of `startedAt` from the `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` function call. The value of `startedAt` is determined by the external data source of the `priceFeed` contract, and the user does not have control over it.
