Reason: The contract state `token1` is an address type variable that is set when the `initialize` function is called and represents the address of one of the tokens in the pair managed by the `PancakePair` contract. It is independent of the `_totalSupply` variable, which is a uint type variable representing the total supply of LP (liquidity provider) tokens for the pair. The `_totalSupply` variable is used in the `burn` function to calculate the amounts of each token to be returned to the user when they burn their LP tokens. The value of `token1` is not modified or dependent on the value of `_totalSupply` within the `burn` function or anywhere else in the contract. The `token1` state simply identifies a token's address and does not change based on the operations performed on the total supply of LP tokens.
