  
No, the ` amount BMin ` variable in add LiquidtyFrom Exchange is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The `add LiqidyFrom Exchnage` function takes in several parameters, including `token A`, ` token B`,`amount A desired`, and `Amount B desired`. The ` Amount B Min` parameter is a required parameter that specifies the minimum amount of token b that must be received in exchange for the amount a desired. This parameter cannot be controlled directly by a user and is instead determined by other factors such as the current market conditions and the liquidty pool. Therefore, `Amout B min` is labeled as 'No' because the value is determined at runtime and cannot  be directly controlled or manipulated by users.
