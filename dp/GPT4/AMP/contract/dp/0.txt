The variable `fromPartitionValidatorImplementation` in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` is data dependent on the variable `fromPartitionPrefix` because `fromPartitionValidatorImplementation` is assigned a value based on the result of a function call that uses `fromPartitionPrefix` as an argument. Specifically, `fromPartitionValidatorImplementation` is assigned the return value of `interfaceAddr`, which is called with `address(this)` and the result of `PartitionUtils._getPartitionStrategyValidatorIName(fromPartitionPrefix)`. The function `_getPartitionStrategyValidatorIName` uses `fromPartitionPrefix` to construct the interface name that is used to look up the address of the corresponding partition strategy validator implementation. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between these two variables within the `_callPreTransferHooks` function.
