Label: unknown

Reason: The provided Solidity code snippet does not include any direct reference to a contract state named `price1CumulativeLast`. Since the variable `balance1` is defined and used within the `mint` function, without seeing the rest of the contract code, it is impossible to determine whether there is a data dependency relationship between `balance1` and `price1CumulativeLast`. The relationship would depend on whether `price1CumulativeLast` is updated based on the value of `balance1` in the `_update` function or elsewhere in the contract, which is not shown in the snippet. Therefore, without additional context or the complete contract code, the data dependency relationship between `price1CumulativeLast` and `balance1` cannot be determined, and the label is 'unknown'.
