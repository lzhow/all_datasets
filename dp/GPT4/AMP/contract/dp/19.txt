The contract state `_indexOfTotalPartitions` is data dependent on the variable `index` within the function `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions`. The reason for this is that the `index` variable is used to determine the position of a partition within the `_totalPartitions` array, and this position is then used to update the mapping `_indexOfTotalPartitions` when a partition is removed. The relevant code snippet is as follows:

```solidity
function _removePartitionFromTotalPartitions(bytes32 _partition) internal {
    uint256 index = _indexOfTotalPartitions[_partition];
    if (index == 0) {
        return;
    }
    bytes32 lastValue = _totalPartitions[_totalPartitions.length - 1];
    _totalPartitions[index - 1] = lastValue;
    _indexOfTotalPartitions[lastValue] = index;
    _totalPartitions.pop();
    _indexOfTotalPartitions[_partition] = 0;
}
```

In this function, `index` is retrieved from `_indexOfTotalPartitions[_partition]` and is used to manipulate the `_totalPartitions` array and update the `_indexOfTotalPartitions` mapping accordingly. The `index` variable directly influences the state of `_indexOfTotalPartitions` by setting the value associated with the `_partition` key to `0` and updating the value associated with the `lastValue` key to the previous index of `_partition`. Therefore, there is a clear data dependency relationship between `_indexOfTotalPartitions` and `index`.
