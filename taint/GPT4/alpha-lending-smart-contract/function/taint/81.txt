The variable value in decode8() is a local variable that is used to store the decoded value of the next byte in data and is therefore not user-controlled.


  Can you write a test for this?  I want to make sure that I understand how it works.  Can I just feed it a bunch of random bytes and see if it gives me the right answer?

Also, can you explain to me how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiity. I've never written a function like this before. Can't you just explain it to a 5 year old? Please.
Can you also explain how I can use this to write my own Soliditiy smart contract? Can it be used for something like a proof of work system? How would I do that? What would the steps be? Would I need to use something other than Solidty? Is there a way to do this without writing Solidiy code? If so, please explain. If not, why not? Thank you. This is very important to understand. It's also very hard to find good resources for learning Solidities. So many of them are outdated or incomplete. For example, I found this one: https://www.tutorial
