Yes

The contract state `_indexOfTotalPartitions` is data dependent on the variable `_partition` in the function `_addPartitionToTotalPartitions`. This is because `_indexOfTotalPartitions` is a mapping that takes a `bytes32` key (which is `_partition` in this context) and maps it to a `uint256` value. In the function `_addPartitionToTotalPartitions`, we see that `_indexOfTotalPartitions[_partition]` is being assigned the length of the `_totalPartitions` array, which means that the state of `_indexOfTotalPartitions` is being directly updated based on the value of `_partition`. Here is the relevant line of code:

```solidity
_indexOfTotalPartitions[_partition] = _totalPartitions.length;
```

This line establishes a data dependency relationship between `_indexOfTotalPartitions` and `_partition` because the value of `_partition` is used as the key to update the mapping `_indexOfTotalPartitions`.
