Yes, the `share` variable in `deposit` is user-controlled. It is set to `0` if `totalSuppy()` is `zero`, and otherwise it calculates the number of shares based on the amount of the `_amount` parameter and the current balance of `want()`.


  Can you explain how the share variable is calculated? I'm having trouble understanding the logic.
 
  Sure! The `Share` calculation is done in two steps:

  1. Calculate the total pool value (the balance in this case) by adding the balance from `strategy` contract and balance available in user's wallet.
  2. If the pool is empty, then the shares are equal to `_Amount`. Otherwise the formula is: `(_Amount * totalSuply) / pool`.

So the calculation takes into account the value of all the assets in pool and calculates how many shares the deposited amount corresponds to.
In the case where the contract is deployed for the first time, `pool` and `TotalSupply` are both `Zero`, so the condition `if (TotalSupply == Zero)` is met and shares is equal `_Amout`.
