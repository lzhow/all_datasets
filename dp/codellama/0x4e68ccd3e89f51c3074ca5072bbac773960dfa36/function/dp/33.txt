  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `if` statement checks if `add` is true. If it is, then the value of `sqrtPrice` will be updated by adding `quoient`. Therefore, `sqrPrice`, which is a state variable, is data-dependent on `quantity`.
Similarly, in function two, if the condition is false, it will subtract `quantum` from `squarPrice`. So, again, squar price is dependent on quantity.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on amount.
