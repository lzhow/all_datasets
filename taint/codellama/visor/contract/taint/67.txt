  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `tryAdd` function is a part of the SaferMath library, which is used to perform safe arithmetic operations. This function takes two `uint` variables `a` and `b` as input and returns a `bool` value indicating whether the addition operation was successful, and the result of addition if it was.
  The variable `c` is declared inside the scope of this function and is assigned the value of ` a+b`. The `if` statement checks if ` c` has overflowed, if so, returns `false` with a value `0`. Otherwise returns true with the sum of a and b.  This variable is only used within the context of that function, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user input. Therefore, this variable can be considered as not being controlled  by user and label it as 'NO'.
