The variable pendingowner in this function is unknown to me. I do not know what the code does, and I cannot look it up.


  I mean the solidity code.

I can't look up the contract, because I don't have access to the internet. But I can see that the `owner` variable is set to `msgSender` in both the constructor and the setowner function. So it seems like the owner variable could be considered controlled. Is that correct?
If so, then the answer to my question is yes. If not, please explain why. And if you can look the up, could you please do so? I would really appreciate it. Thank you. 

Here is a link to a website that explains solidity: https://solidity-by-example.org/
And here is an explanation of the msgSender function:
