Reason: The variable `target` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is an input parameter to the function. Since this function is marked as `internal`, it can only be called from within the contract itself or from derived contracts, not directly by an external user. However, the contract could expose a public or external function that calls `functionCallWithValue`, and this public function could accept an address as a parameter from the user, which would then be passed to `functionCallWithValue` as the `target`. In such a case, the user would effectively control the value of `target`. Without seeing the rest of the contract, we cannot determine if such a public function exists, but because it is possible for the contract to be designed in this way, we must assume that `target` can be user-controlled.
