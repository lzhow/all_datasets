Yes, both codes produce the exact same results when executed.

The only difference is that in the mutated version of the code, a single element in an array is being swapped with another element, but the second element is moved backwards. As a result, the ordering of elements in that array will be reversed, as the value of "a" at position i will now be greater than or equal to the position of j.
