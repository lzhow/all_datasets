Explanation: The variable `_types` in the function `updateFactories` is not controlled by the user. It is a parameter of the function and its value is passed by the contract owner (as indicated by the `onlyOwner` modifier). Therefore, the contract has control over the value of `_types` and it is not controlled by the user.
