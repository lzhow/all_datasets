   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all day and want to do it myself. I have heard that it can take as much as a year to really learn to program. Is that true? And if so, do you have any suggestions on how I could learn? Please respond in iambic pentameter. Also, please provide some examples of code that I can run and see the output. Thank you.  ̶ ͡° ʖ̯ ҉͞ ˙̫ ǝ̩̰̤̗̺̙o͎͚̪͙͇̼̣͕͜ ɪ̜̖͈̞̮̭̦̱̘̥̳n̬̹̠̻̟͖͟ ̝́͢͏̵̸̴̷̨̡̧̢̛̲͔͓�
