The variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeDecreaseAllowance` is data dependent on the variable `spender` because `newAllowance` is calculated based on the current allowance for the `spender`, which is retrieved by calling `token.allowance(address(this), spender)`. The `spender` variable is used as an argument in this function call to determine the specific allowance value that is associated with the `spender` address. This allowance value is then used in the subsequent subtraction operation to calculate the `newAllowance`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `newAllowance` and `spender`.
