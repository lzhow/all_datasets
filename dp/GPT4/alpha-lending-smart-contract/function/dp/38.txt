Label: no

Reason: The provided code snippet only shows the constructor of a Solidity contract where the parameter `_alTokenDeployer` is being assigned to the state variable `alTokenDeployer`. There is no mention or indication of the contract state `pools` in the given code. Without additional context or code showing how `pools` is declared or modified, it is impossible to determine a data dependency relationship between `pools` and `_alTokenDeployer`. Therefore, based on the given information, `pools` is not data dependent on `_alTokenDeployer`.
