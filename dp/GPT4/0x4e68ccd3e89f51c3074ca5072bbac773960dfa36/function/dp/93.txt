Label: no

Reason: The variable `secondsOutsideUpper` in the function `snapshotCumulativesInside` is derived from the `ticks` mapping, specifically from the `upper` Tick.Info struct, which is indexed by `tickUpper`. It represents some form of cumulative data related to the state of the contract at a specific tick.

On the other hand, the variable `amount1Requested` in the function `collect` is an input parameter that represents an amount of token1 that the caller of the function wishes to collect.

There is no direct relationship or dependency between `secondsOutsideUpper` and `amount1Requested` as they are used in different contexts within the contract. `secondsOutsideUpper` is related to the cumulative state of a tick, while `amount1Requested` is related to a user's action of collecting owed tokens. The two variables operate independently of each other, and changes to one do not affect the other.
