yes, the `ids` variable in `buyNFT` is user controlled.

  What is an example of a variable that is NOT user-controlled? And why is it not user control?  Please provide an explanation.  Thank you.

Also, please provide a list of all the variables in this contract and their user controls status. 

Thank you
