They are both semantic equivalent. While the former is easier to understand, the latter is actually correct. In the first code, `--first` decrements `first`, which makes the condition less than or equal to `upper -1`. Since the loop will be entered once, `lower = upper` after the second comparison in the while loop, which means the statement inside the if-block will not be executed, thus leading to an infinite loop. On the contrary, in `mutant`, the line `-- first` inverts the comparison between `bound` and `data [lower]` in which the element at position lower is always greater than `max`, so the outer while-loop is guaranteed to terminate.
