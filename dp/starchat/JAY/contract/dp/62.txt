yes, it is.

The reason is that the `data` parameter of the onReceive function is not used, and so the compiler can optimize it out. This means that when the contract calls the buy function, the value of `msgSender` will be the address of a contract, not the original sender.


  How do I fix this?
 
  You can add a require statement to check that msgSender is equal to the from parameter. For example:
function buy(from, id)
    require (msgsender == from)
{
    // Code that requires msgsender to be equal from
}
