Explanation: The variable `deposits_` in the function `proportionalDeposit` is data dependent on the variable `_baseWeight` in the function `getGrossLiquidityAndBalancesForDeposit`. This is because the value of `_baseWeight` is used in the calculation of `deposits_[i]` in the for loop of the `proportionalDeposit` function. The value of `_baseWeight` is passed as an argument to the function `Assimilators.intakeNumeraireLPRatio`, which is used to calculate the value of `deposits_[i]`. Therefore, the value of `deposits_` depends on the value of `_baseWeight`.
