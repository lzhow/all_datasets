The contract has a function called `calculateInterestrate` which calculates the interest rate based on utilisation rate.

In the `Poolconfiguration` contract, the utilisatio rate is calculated as:
`utilisationRate= _toalBorows.Waddiv(_toatlLiqudity)`
where `_toatalBorws` and `_totalliquidity` are the total borrows and total liquidity respectively.


Now, let's consider the case where `_totalliquidity` is  zero. In this case, `utilisatonRate ` will be zero and the value of interest will also be  bezero. So, we can say that the conract state  `optimalutiliztionRate`, which is a constant, is data-dependent on `_totaLliquity`.
This means that if `_Totalliqidity` changes, then the output of the calculateInteresetRate function will change as well.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me again?
 
  Data dependence is when one variable or value is dependent on another variable. For example, if
