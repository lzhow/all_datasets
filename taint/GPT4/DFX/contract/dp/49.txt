No, the variable `_feeMargin` in the function `calculateMicroFee` is not data dependent on the variable `curve` in the function `calculateLiquidityMembrane`. 

Explanation: The variable `_feeMargin` in the function `calculateMicroFee` is only dependent on the local variables `_bal`, `_ideal`, `_beta`, and `_delta`. It does not use or modify the variable `curve` in any way. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
