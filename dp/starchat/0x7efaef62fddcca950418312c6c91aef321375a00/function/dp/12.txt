The contract function '_mintfee' is used to calculate the amount of CAKE tokens that should be minted for liqudity providers. It takes two inputs: the reserves of the two tokens (in this case, CAKES and WETH) and the current value of k, which is a constant used in calculating the price of each token.

First, the code checks if there is an address set as the fee recipient (i.e., the address that receives any fees generated by the liqidity pool). If there isn't, then the 'feeon' variable is set to false and no fees are generated. If the recipient address is non-zero, it then calculates the new value for k using the formula:
k_new = (reserve_0 * reserve_1) / (total_supply * 2)
where total_suply is equal to the sum of all CAke tokens currently in existence. This is then compared to k_last, a variable that stores the previous value k. 

If k has increased, i. e., if the value is greater than klast (the previous k value), then it calculates a new liquiudity amount using a formula that takes into account
