  
No, the variables `_reserves` and `_balances` are both data-dependent on `_mints` but not on each other.

The reason is that the `_update` function updates the reserves and balances based on changes to the total supply, but it does not update the balance of a specific token based solely on a change in another token's balance. Therefore, `_totalsupply`, `_tokens`, and other variables that are updated by `_updates` cannot be data dependencies of eachother.
