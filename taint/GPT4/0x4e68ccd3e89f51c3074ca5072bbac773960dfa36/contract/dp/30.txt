Reason: The variable `result` in the function `mulDiv` is data dependent on the variable `b` in the function `mulDivRoundingUp` because `result` is computed based on the multiplication and division of the inputs `a`, `b`, and `denominator`. The function `mulDivRoundingUp` calls `mulDiv` and passes its own parameters `a`, `b`, and `denominator` to it. Since `b` is one of the parameters used in the computation of `result` within `mulDiv`, any changes to `b` in `mulDivRoundingUp` would affect the value of `result` returned by `mulDiv`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `result` in `mulDiv` and `b` in `mulDivRoundingUp`.
