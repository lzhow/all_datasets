  
No, the variables ` blockTimestap` and ` rootklast` are independent.

The variable  `  blocktimestamp` is a local variable in function  `_update` that is assigned the current block timestamp. It is not dependent on any other variable.  On the other hand,  the  variable   `rookkast`   is also a  local  varible in  function   `_ mintF`e that  is calculated as the square root of the product of  two  variables  that are  passed as  arguments to the   function.   The  value  of   the ` rooklast ` variable is only dependent  on  its own  calculation and not on other variables. Therefore, it is independent of `bloctimestamp`.
