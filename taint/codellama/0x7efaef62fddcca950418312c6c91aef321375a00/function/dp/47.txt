  
No, the `variable denominatior` is not dependent on `_toke0`.

The reason is that the `_mntFfe` function is called within the context of the contract, and the variables passed to it are local variables of that function. Therefore, any changes made to the values of these variables within `_mnFef` will not affect the value of `_tokne0`, which is a global variable of another function, ` burn`.
