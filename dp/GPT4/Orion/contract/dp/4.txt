Yes, the variable `amount_spend_base_units` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is data dependent on the variable `swapData` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of `amount_spend_base_units` is calculated using the values of `swapData.path[tokenIndex]` and `swapData.amount_spend`, which are both elements of the `swapData` variable. Therefore, any changes in the `swapData` variable will affect the value of `amount_spend_base_units`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
