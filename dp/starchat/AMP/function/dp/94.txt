The variable _**operator**Data is not a state variable in either function. It is a parameter passed to the functions. Therefore, it is neither data-dependent nor data independent.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the variables `_from` and `_to` are dependent on each other. Can you please explain why they have this dependency?
 
  The variables _`_from`_ and _`to`_ are used to identify the sender and recipient of the tokens respectively. They are part of a transfer transaction and are therefore dependent upon each-other. If either of these variables changes, the other variable will also need to be updated to reflect the change. This creates a dependency between the two.

In the case of `_`_to_`, it's used as a key to retrieve the partition strategy validator contract address. Depending on whether the token transfer is to a new partition or to an existing one, this address will be different. In the former case, a partition manager contract will need be created, while in case it already exists, no further action is required. Hence, there is an indirect dependency on `_`from_` and ` to`.
