yes, the `uint total` variable in `buyNFT` is user controlled. It is used to keep track of the total number of NFTs that the buyer is buying.

  What is a good way to prevent overflows in solidity? I'm having issues with the above code because of overflow. I know that I can use Safe Math, but I don't know how to implement it in this case. Can you help me out? Thanks!
