  
No, the ` protocolAmount ` variable in ` get Returned Ammounts ` is not dependent on ` totalAmountF ` in` get returned Ammoutns `.

The ` return ` statement in  `  get return Amoutn ` returns a tuple of three values, which are calculated using the values of ` output `, ` returnedAmmount ` and ` marketPlaceFieeAmount `. The values are dependent only on each other and not on any other variables.
