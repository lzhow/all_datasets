yes, the `AMP` contract is a user-controlled smart contract.

The `owner` variable is declared as `public` and is set in its constructor. This means that the contract creator is considered the owner of the smart contracts. Anyone can call the constructor and set the initial owner. However, this does not mean that all subsequent code will be executed by that owner, as the code can be re-assigned at any time. Therefore, any subsequent changes to the state of this contract must be approved by this owner beforehand.


  How can I fix this? I am a beginner and I don't know how to do it





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?
A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, and L moves. JPLL algorithms are easy to implement and can solve a cube in just a few seconds. Here are some easy algorithms to learn:
1. Beginner: The first algorithm to try is called the "OLL" algorithm. It is based on the idea of solving the cube one layer at a time, from the outside in. To solve the OLL, you would
