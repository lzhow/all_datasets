Label: no

Reason: The contract state `isCToken` is not present in the provided Solidity code, and therefore, it cannot have a data dependency relationship with the variable `oldImplementation` or any other variable in the code. Since `isCToken` is not defined or used in the given code snippet, there is no way to establish a data dependency between it and `oldImplementation`. Data dependency would require that the value of one is derived from or affects the other, which is not possible here due to the absence of `isCToken`.
