  
No, the ` protocolDefaultF_ ` variable in this function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined within the scope of the contract. It is created and initialized by a function call to `getProtocolDefault()` and is only accessible within that function. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled internally by this contract and not by any external user or caller.
