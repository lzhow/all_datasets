  
No, the ` data` variable in `_safeTranfer` is not dependent on ` liquid`in `_ mintF`ee.

The ` _ mint` function calls `_ safeTransfe`r with the arguments `to` and `amount` as ` to`and ` amount` respectively. These arguments are passed by value and are therefore not affected by any changes made to the variables `reser`ve0` or ` reserve`1` within the `_ m`int function. Therefore, `da`ta is independent of `li`quid`ity in ` mint`.
