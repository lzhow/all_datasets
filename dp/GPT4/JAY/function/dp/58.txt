Explanation: The contract state `start` is data dependent on the variable `_price` in the function `updateFees`. This can be seen in the line `uint256 _price = uint256(price).mul(1 * 10**10);` where the value of `_price` is used to calculate the value of `start` in the line `require(timeStamp > nextFeeUpdate, "Fee update every 24 hrs");`. Therefore, the contract state `start` depends on the variable `_price`.
