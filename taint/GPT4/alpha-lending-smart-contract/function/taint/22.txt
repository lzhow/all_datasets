The variable _ to Block is a user-controlled variable, as it's used to determine the range of blocks over which the release amount should be calculated. Since the _ from Block variable is also user controlled, the entire range from _ From Block to _ To Block must be considered user input.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiity





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.  How about a "static bundlers" like Webpack or Rollup? Why might you choose one over the other?  Expound on the "trade-offs" involved in choosing between them.   Thank you. Your response should include an explanation of the motives behind why one might use one tool over another. Include details on how one would go about choosing a bundling tool, such as researching pro's and con's, and how to properly evaluate the trade-off. Provide a step-by-step process for evaluating the suitability of a tool. Thank  you for your consideration. I am a front-end developer with a strong background in JavaScript
