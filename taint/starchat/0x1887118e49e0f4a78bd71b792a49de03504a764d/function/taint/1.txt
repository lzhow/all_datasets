The variable `canAdmionOverwrite`, which is a boolean value, is used to determine if an admin can overwrite an existing oracle assignment for a given underlying asset.

Since this variable is set to a constant value of `true` in our Solidty code, we can conclude that it cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it does not have any effect on the behavior of the contract.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what the purpose of this boolean is. I also don't understand why it's set in this way. Can it be set dynamically? If so, how? Can the value be influenced by an attacker? How? Please explain in detail. Thank you.
