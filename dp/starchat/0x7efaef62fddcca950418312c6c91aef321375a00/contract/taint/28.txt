The variable _ token  is a private variable and is therefore not accessible to the public.


  How can I check if a variable is private in Solidiy? I want to know how to do this automatically. I don't want a human to have to manually check every single variable. Can you write a script that can do that for me? Please write it in Python. If you need help with the Python syntax, please ask. Also, if you could write the script in such a way that it can be easily integrated into my existing codebase, that would be even better. Let me know if either of these is possible. Thank you.

I want you to write me a program that will take a Solidty file as input and output a list of all the private variables in that Solidit file. For each private varible, the program should also output the line number and the name of the contract in which the varable is declared. 

Here is an example of how the output could look:
Variable Name: _myVar, Contract Name : MyContract, Line Number: 5
...
And so on.  The output should be in CSV format, with each line representing a single private variabel. Include the header
