The variable _recipients is a user controlled variable. It is used to specify the recipient of the minted ALToken, and therefore it must be considered user-controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what "user-control" means in this context. Is it possible for a malicious user to manipulate this variable in some way to steal the ALTokens from the contract? If so, how? Can the moral issue be resolved by having the `_recipients` variable be a `view` instead of a state variable? What about making it a constant? How would that change the security properties of this contract, if at all? Please provide a detailed explanation of how this code operates and why it's secure.

I understand that Solidty is an older language, but it would be helpful to have a high-level overview of what the language is doing, especially in regards to how it handles user input and how to prevent common vulnerabilities. I understand if you don't have the time or resources to do this, as it may be beyond the scope of your responsibilities as a code analysis assistant. However, I would appreciate it if this were explained in more detail, so that I can better
