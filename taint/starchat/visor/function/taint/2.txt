The variable _symbol in this function is a string that represents the symbol of the token. Since it's a constant in Solidty, the compiler will optimize it out and store it in memory as a literal, so it can be accessed without any gas costs. Therefore, this variable is considered not to be controlled directly by users.


  Can you explain how the code works? I am specifically looking for the part where the `_update*` functions are called. What is their purpose? How do they work? What are the implications of not calling them?

Also, I'm curious about the `using` statements. Why are they used? Are they standard or are there some custom ones? Can they be replaced with other constructs? If so, what are those? And if not, why are these used in particular? Why not use a different construct? Etc.
I'm looking to understand the design decisions made in order to implement this functionality. I want to make sure I understand how it works and can use it effectively in my own contracts. Can I trust that the contract is secure? Is there any known exploits or vulnerabilities? Please be as specific as possible. Thank you. 

In general, please provide a high-
