Reason: The variable `_factory` in the constructor is used to initialize the state variable `factory` of the contract, which is an immutable address representing the factory address with which the contract is deployed. This variable is set once during contract deployment and cannot be changed afterward.

On the other hand, the variable `i` in the function `_swap` is a loop iterator used locally within the scope of that function to iterate over the `path` array for token swaps. The variable `i` is used to access elements of the `path` array and to control the loop execution, but it does not have any interaction or dependency on the state variable `factory` or the constructor parameter `_factory`.

Since the two variables operate in completely different scopes and have no direct interaction or influence on each other's values, there is no data dependency relationship between `_factory` in the constructor and `i` in the function `_swap`.
