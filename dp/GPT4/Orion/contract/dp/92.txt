Reason: The contract state `supportedFactories` is a mapping that keeps track of the supported factory addresses and their corresponding types. In the function `_addLiquidity`, the variable `tokenA` is used to interact with the factory to either check for an existing pair or create a new pair of tokens. The `supportedFactories` mapping is not accessed or modified in any way within the `_addLiquidity` function, nor does the function logic depend on the state of `supportedFactories` when dealing with the `tokenA` variable. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `supportedFactories` and `tokenA` within the context of the `_addLiquidity` function.
