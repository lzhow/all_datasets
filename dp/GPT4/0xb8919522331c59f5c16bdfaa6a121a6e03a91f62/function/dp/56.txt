  
The label is 'No'.

In the `sendValue` function, the value of the local variable 'recipent' is not dependent on any other variable or state in that function. It is only dependent upon the input parameters of that particular function and the state of other variables in other functions.
On the other hand, in ` functioncallwithvalue`, the return data is dependent only on other state variables and not on ` recipent`.
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
