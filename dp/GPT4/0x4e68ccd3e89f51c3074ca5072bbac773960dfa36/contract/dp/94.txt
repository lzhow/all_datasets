yes

The variable `blockTimestamp` in the function `write` is data dependent on the variable `last` because the logic within the `write` function uses the `last.blockTimestamp` to determine the flow of execution and to compute the new observation. Specifically, the `write` function checks if `last.blockTimestamp` is equal to the input `blockTimestamp`, and if it is not, it proceeds to update the observation array with a new observation based on the `last` observation and the input `blockTimestamp`. The `transform` function is called with `last` as an argument, and the resulting observation's `blockTimestamp` is directly set to the input `blockTimestamp`, which shows a clear data dependency between `last` and the new `blockTimestamp` value within the observation being written to the storage.
