  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `position` function, the variables `wordpos` and `bitpos`, which are used to calculate `tick`, are dependent on `int tick`.
`compress` is dependent `pos`.  `Compress`, `ticks`, and`tickspacing` are all dependent variables in `flip tick`
Therefore, ` compres` depends on`self`.
