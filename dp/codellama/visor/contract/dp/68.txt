  
The label is 'No'.

In the `Address` library, the functions `sendValue`, `call`, and `delegateCall` are all implemented using the same pattern: they call the target contract's `receive` function with the provided data and value. However, `Delegatecall` is different from the other two functions in that it does not pass the value as an argument to the called function. Instead, it uses the current contract balance as the call value and passes the data as a parameter to `delegatcall`.
Therefore, in `FunctionCallwithValue` and`functionCall`, the`target `variable is data-dependent on`error Message` because it is used as one of the arguments to`call `and`send Value`. However , in`FunctionDelegate Call`,` target`is not dependent on ` error Message`, because the balance of current account is passed as callvalue and not as argument.
