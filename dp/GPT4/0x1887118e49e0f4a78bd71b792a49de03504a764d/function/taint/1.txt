Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_canAdminOverwrite` in the constructor function is set when the contract is deployed. The value of this variable is determined by the arguments provided to the constructor by the user (deployer) at the time of contract deployment. Since the deployer has control over the arguments passed to the constructor, they control the initial value of `_canAdminOverwrite`. Once set, this variable can influence the behavior of the `add` function, specifically whether the admin is allowed to overwrite existing oracle assignments. However, after deployment, the value of `_canAdminOverwrite` cannot be changed by users through any function calls, as there is no function provided in the contract to alter it post-deployment.
