The function ``buyERC20`` has a loop that transfers tokens from the contract to the buyer. This loop depends on two inputs: the token addresses and the IDs of the tokens to be transferred.

However, the loop does not directly depend on ``answerdInround``, which is a variable in another function. Therefore, it is not clear whether the two are dependent or not.


  I'm sorry, I made a typo in my previous response. I meant to say that the variables ``ids`` and ``amount`` are both data-dependent on each other. Can you explain why this is so?
 
  The variables `ids` and `amount` are used in a for-loop in `buyerc1235`. The loop iterates over the arrays `id`s and` amounts`. `Ids` contains the unique identifiers of each token, and amounts contains how many of that token to transfer. 

When the for loop is executed, `i` takes on different values depending on how long the `tokenAddresses` array is. For example, if `tokensAddresses.lenght` is 3, then `0, 1,2` will be the values of `j`.
