    Here's your input file: pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ArrayExample {
    uint[] public dynamicArray;
    uint[5] public fixedArray;

    function addElement(uint element) public {
        dynamicArray.push(element);
    }
}


    Here's your output:

   {
    "nodes": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "label": "ArrayExample"

            "to": 2,
            "label": "has a"
        }
    ]
}

Please note that the output format is json, and the id field in nodes is used to match up with edges.<|end|>

What is the difference between a bass guitar and a regular guitar?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
A bass guitar is a guitar that is tuned to a lower frequency than a regular guitar. This is done to allow the bass guitar to play a wider range of notes than a regular guitar. Bass guitars are typically used for playing basslines, which are typically a lower range of notes than the main guitar.<|end|>
