Reason: The variable `slot0Start` is a memory copy of the state variable `slot0` at the beginning of the `swap` function. It captures the state of `slot0` at that point in time and is used for reference throughout the function. The variable `liquidityNet` is calculated later in the function during the swap process, and it represents the net change in liquidity as a result of crossing a tick. The value of `liquidityNet` is used to update the `state.liquidity`, which is a local variable representing the liquidity state during the swap process.

The key point here is that `slot0Start` is a snapshot of `slot0` taken before any changes occur in the function, and it is not modified after its initialization. Therefore, `slot0Start` does not depend on `liquidityNet` or any other variables that are calculated after its initialization. Changes to the state variable `slot0` or any other state variables that occur after `slot0Start` is initialized do not affect the value of `slot0Start` within the scope of the `swap` function.
