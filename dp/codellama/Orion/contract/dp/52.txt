In the constructor function, the `_factor` variable is assigned a value that is passed as an argument to the contract. This value is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in `AddLiuquidtyFromexchange` function the `AmountBdesired`, which is a parameter of the method, is used to calculate the value of ` amountbOptimum` and ` AmountAoptimal` variables. These variables are then used in calculations to determine the values of `_amounta`and `_ amount b` that are returned by the functions. However, these calculations do not involve the use of any variables other than the ones passed to them as parameters. Therefore, `_ factory` is independent of` amount Bdesire`d.
