  
The variable 'scaler' in function 'divScalerByEx' is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user input.

In the code, the 'mulScalr' function is called with the scalar variable as an argument. This means that the value of the `scale` variable can come from user inputs. Therefore, if a malicious user were to provide a value for the scale variable that is too large or too small, they could potentially cause an error or a loss of precision in calculations.
