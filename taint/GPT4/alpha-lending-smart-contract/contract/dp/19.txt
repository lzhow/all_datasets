Yes

The variable `index` in the function `setAlphaReleaseRule` is data dependent on the variable `receiverRule` because `index` is assigned the value of `receiverRuleList.length.sub(1)` after the `receiverRule` is pushed onto the `receiverRuleList`. The length of `receiverRuleList` changes as a direct result of adding the new `receiverRule`, which means that the value of `index` is directly influenced by the addition of `receiverRule` to the list.
