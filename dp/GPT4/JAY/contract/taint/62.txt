Explanation: The variable `_price` in the function `updateFees` is not controlled by the user. It is derived from the `price` variable obtained from the `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` function, which retrieves the latest price from an external source. The user has no control over this external price feed, so the variable is not controlled by the user.
