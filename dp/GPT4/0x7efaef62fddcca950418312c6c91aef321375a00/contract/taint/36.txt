Label: no

Reason: The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is not directly controlled by the user. It is the result of a low-level `call` to an ERC20 token contract's `transfer` function. The `success` variable indicates whether this `transfer` call was successful or not. While a user can trigger a transfer by calling functions that lead to `_safeTransfer` being executed, they cannot directly control the outcome of the `transfer` function within the ERC20 token contract. The `success` variable's value is determined by the execution of the `transfer` function in the context of the state of the ERC20 token contract, which includes checks for sufficient balance and allowances.
