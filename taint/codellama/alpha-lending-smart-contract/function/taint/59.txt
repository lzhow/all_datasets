  
The variable receiver rule in get alpha release rules is labeled as 'No'. The reason is that the receiverrule is a struct variable that is defined in a different contract. It is created by a function called set alpha releaserule. This function is only accessible to the owner of the contract, and the only way to access the struct is through the getalpha relese rules function. Therefore, the value of receiver rules cannot be controlled directly by users.
