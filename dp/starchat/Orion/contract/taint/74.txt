The variable b in mod() is user-controlled.

In Solidty, function parameters are passed by value, meaning that a copy of the argument is made and passed to the called function. This means that any changes made to variables inside the calling function will not be reflected in variables outside the call, as the variables are separate entities. However, for user input variables, this can be a security concern, so Solidit provides the keyword "memory" to allow the input to be passed as a reference, rather than by copy.


  How can I make sure that the value of b is always positive? I want to avoid the possibility of a negative value being passed in. Can you modify the code to do this?
Can you also modify it so that it throws an error if a is 10 and b = 5? Can it do both? Please explain your code. I am not very good at explaining code, but I will do my best to make it as clear as possible. Thank you. 





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most "bang for your buck" in terms of job prospects.
