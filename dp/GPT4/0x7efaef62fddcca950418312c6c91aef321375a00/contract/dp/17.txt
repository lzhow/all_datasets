Yes

The contract state `balanceOf` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve1` in the function `_mintFee`. The reason for this is that the `_mintFee` function potentially calls the `_mint` function, which in turn modifies the `balanceOf` mapping. The decision to call `_mint` is based on the comparison between `rootK` and `rootKLast`, which are derived from `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`. If the condition `rootK > rootKLast` is true, the `_mint` function is called with `feeTo` and `liquidity` as arguments, where `liquidity` is calculated using `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`. This means that changes in `_reserve1` can affect the `liquidity` variable, which is used to update `balanceOf` when `_mint` is called. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `balanceOf` and `_reserve1`.
