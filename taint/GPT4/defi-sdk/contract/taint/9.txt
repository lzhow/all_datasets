yes

The variable `allowanceTarget` in the function `approveAndCall` is controlled by the user because it is derived from the `callerCallData` parameter of the `callBytes` function, which is marked as `calldata`. The `callerCallData` is provided by the external caller of the `callBytes` function, which means that the user invoking the function can pass any address as the `allowanceTarget`. Since the `callBytes` function is external and does not have any access control mechanisms in the provided code snippet, any user can call it and control the value of `allowanceTarget`.
