Explanation: The variable `target` in the function `functionCall` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `functionDelegateCall`. This is because the `target` variable is passed as an argument to the `functionCallWithValue` function, which is called with the `data` variable as one of its arguments. Therefore, the value of `data` affects the value of `target`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
