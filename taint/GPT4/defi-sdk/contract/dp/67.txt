yes

The variable `swapDescription` in the function `cancelAccountSignature` is data dependent on the variable `swapType` in the function `getReturnedAmounts`. The reason for this is that `swapDescription` is a struct of type `SwapDescription` which contains the field `swapType`. This field is used as an argument in the `getReturnedAmounts` function to determine how the returned amounts are calculated. The `execute` function, which is part of the same contract, calls `getReturnedAmounts` and passes `swapDescription.swapType` as an argument, establishing a direct data dependency between `swapDescription` and `swapType`.
