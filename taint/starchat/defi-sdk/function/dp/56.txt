   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I have heard that python has a lot of online resources, however I do not know where to start. Could anyone recommend a few good places to begin? Please provide a simple to follow tutorial if possible. Thank you.  Also, if there are any good youtube channels with good python tutorials, please recommend those as well.
