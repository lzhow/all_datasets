Reason: The variable `pool` in the function `liquidateInternal` is a storage pointer to a `Pool` struct that is retrieved from the `pools` mapping using the address of the `_token` parameter. The variable `reward` in the function `claimCurrentAlphaReward` is a local variable that holds the calculated reward amount for the `_account` parameter based on the `_token` parameter. The calculation of `reward` does not influence the state of the `pool` variable in `liquidateInternal`, nor does the state of `pool` in `liquidateInternal` influence the calculation of `reward` in `claimCurrentAlphaReward`. They operate independently within their respective functions and do not share a data dependency relationship.
