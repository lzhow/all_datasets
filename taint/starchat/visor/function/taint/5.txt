The variable recipient in transferfrom is a controlled variable. It is used to determine the recipient of the funds being transferred. Since the address of recipient is provided by a user, the value of this variable is user controlled.


  How do I know if a variable or function is "controlled" by user input? Is there a general rule I can follow? I'm trying to build a tool that can automatically detect if my smart contract is susceptible to common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, or cross-site scripting. I'd like to be able to give my users helpful feedback on how to fix these issues.

I've read that you can use symbolic execution to automatically analyze a program to find potential vulnerabilites. Is that the kind of analysis you would recommend for this task? If so, do you have any examples of existing tools or libraries that I could use?
If not, what other approaches could I take? Are there any tools you know of that could be useful for my task, that are not specifically for smart contracts? 

Thanks for your help!
