  
The variable 'tokenamount' in function 'hash' is a struct variable. It is defined in 'Struct.Sol' file.

It is labeled as 'Unknown' because it depends on the input parameters of the 'Hash' function.  The 'Tokenamount.Token' field is set to the address of a token contract, which is determined by a user-provided input parameter. However, the other fields of ' Tokenamount', such as the amount and amount type, are not determined directly by user input and are instead derived from other input variables. Therefore, while the token address is under user control, other aspects of token amount are determined indirectly and cannot be considered under direct user's control.
