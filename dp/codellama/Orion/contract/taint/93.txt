In the `tryMUL` function, the value of `a` is passed as an argument, and the result is stored in `c`. The value ` b` in this function is a local variable that is defined within the scope of the tryMult function. It is initialized with the default value  of 1.
Therefore, `B` can be controlled  by a user in a scenario where the contract is called with a value for `A` that causes an overflow. In this case, an attacker could pass a large value to ` A` to cause an underflow in variable  `C`.
