In the `getAccountSnapShot` function, the value of `borRowBalanc` is calculated using the internal function`borrrowBalanaceStorredInternal`. This function takes the current block number as an argument. Therefore, ` borrRowbalance` depends on ` currentblockNumber`.
Similarly, in ` accureInteres`t,the value `cTokenbalancE`is calculated by calling the`getCasHPrior`function. Thisfunction also takes `currenBlocknumber` as a parameter.
Therefore,`cTockenbalanCe` and ` currenblocknumber `are data-dependent.
