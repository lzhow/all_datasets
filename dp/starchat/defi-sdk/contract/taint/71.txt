The variable protocolFeesigner in getprotocolFeesigners is a user-controlled variable. It is set by calling the setprotocolFeessigne function, which is only callable by an owner.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a tool that can help me do this automatically?

I am writing a smart contract and I want to make sure that certain variables are not user controllable.  For example, I do not want a malicious user to be able to set a value for a counter variable that I use to track the number of transactions that have been processed.
Is there any way to do that automatically, or do you have to manually look at the code to see if any variables can be set or controlled in a potentially maliucious way?


If there is no tool to help with this, then what are some good ways to prevent malleability? For instance, if I have a mapping that maps addresses to integers, is there anything I can do to ensure that the mapping cannot be modified in such a way that an attacker can add new addresses or modify the values associated with existing addresses? Or is that something that would have be done on a case-
