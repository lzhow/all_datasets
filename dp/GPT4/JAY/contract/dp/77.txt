Explanation: The variable `success` in the function `buyJayNoNFT` is not directly dependent on the variable `nftsSold` in the function `getTotals`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `nftsSold` in the `buyJayNoNFT` function. However, it is possible that the value of `nftsSold` could indirectly affect the value of `success` if there are other functions or code paths that modify the state of the contract and subsequently affect the execution of `buyJayNoNFT`. Without further analysis of the entire contract and its interactions, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these two variables.
