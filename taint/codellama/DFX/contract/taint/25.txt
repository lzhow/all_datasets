  
The variable _`target `in the target swap function is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user input. This is because the `_ target` variable is used as an argument in a function call to `Swapes. target Swap`, which is a public function that can only be called by external users. Therefore, the value of `_` target can potentially be manipulated by an external user, making it controlled.

In contrast, other variables such as `_origin`, `_maxoriginamount`, and `_delegatedeadline` are not labled as controlled because they are used in internal functions and are therefore not directly accessible to external callers. Additionally, some variables like `curvemint` and `depoist` in `proporional deposite` function are also not label as controled because these variables are created internally and not accessible from outside the contract.
