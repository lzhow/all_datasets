Reason: The variable `amt_` in the function `intakeRawAndGetBalance` is not directly dependent on the variable `_quoteWeight` in the function `intakeNumeraireLPRatio`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `_quoteWeight` in the code snippet provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables based on the given code.
