Explanation: The variable `c` in the function `get_y` is data dependent on the variable `_x` in the same function. This can be observed from the following code snippet:

```
if(_i == uint128(i))
    _x = x;
else if(_i != uint128(j))
    _x = xp_[_i];
else
    continue;
S_ += _x;
c = c * D / (_x * N_COINS);
```

In this code snippet, the value of `_x` is assigned to `c` in the line `c = c * D / (_x * N_COINS)`. Therefore, the value of `c` depends on the value of `_x`.
