The variable `hashedAccountSignatureData` in the function `validateAndExpireAccountSignature` is data dependent on the variable `input` in the same function. This is because `hashedAccountSignatureData` is calculated using the `hashAccountSignatureData` function, which takes `input` as one of its arguments. The `input` variable contributes to the data that is hashed to produce `hashedAccountSignatureData`. Therefore, any changes to `input` would affect the value of `hashedAccountSignatureData`.
