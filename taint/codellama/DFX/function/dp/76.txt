The variable _ dead line in depositeWithWhiteList is not dependent on _ curvesTo Burn in view Withdraw. This is because the _ curvedTo burn variable is only used in a view function, which does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, the value of _ curveToburn is determined before the call to viewPropotional WithDraw, and the result of view Propotinal With Draw is independent of its value.
