Reason: The contract state `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is a constant with a fixed value and is not modified anywhere in the contract. It is defined as:

```solidity
bytes32 public constant PERMIT_TYPEHASH = 0x6e71edae12b1b97f4d1f60370fef10105fa2faae0126114a169c64845d6126c9;
```

On the other hand, `_reserve1` is a variable that represents part of the contract's state related to liquidity reserves and is defined as a private variable within the `PancakePair` contract:

```solidity
uint112 private reserve1;
```

The function `getReserves` simply returns the current value of the `reserve1` state variable, among other reserve-related data:

```solidity
function getReserves() public view returns (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1, uint32 _blockTimestampLast) {
    _reserve0 = reserve0;
    _reserve1 = reserve1;
    _blockTimestampLast = blockTimestampLast;
}
```

Since `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is a constant and does not change based on the state of `_reserve1`, and `_reserve1` does not depend on `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` for its value, there is no data dependency relationship between `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` and `_reserve1`.
