  
The label is 'Unknown'.

There are several reasons why the dependency between the `Curves[]` contract and the `_Name` variable in `NewCurver` is unknown:
1. `Name[] _Name`: This is a local variable that is defined within the scope of the New Curver function. It is not a contract variable, and it is only accessible within this function's scope.
2. Curves: This contract is an array of addresses, which is stored in a mapping called `Currencies`. The `getCurv` function is used to retrieve the address of a curve based on a currency pair. However, this mapping is never updated within ` NewCurre`.
3. keckak 2 5 6: The kecca2 function generates a unique hash based  on two currency pairs. This hash is then used as a key to store the curve address in  the Curvemapping.  However , this hash function does not depend on any variable within Newcurver. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the hash generated by keca2 is dependent on _ name.
