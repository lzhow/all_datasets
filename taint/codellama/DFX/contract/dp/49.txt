The variable _`feemargin ` is not dependent on ` curve` because it is a local variable in ` calculate microF` and is only used in that function. It is never used or referenced in any other function, including ` `Calculate Liquidty Membran`e`. Therefore, it cannot be considered data-dependent on any variable or state in another function or class.
