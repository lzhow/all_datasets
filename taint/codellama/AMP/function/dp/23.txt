Explanation:
In the given function, the `sub` function is used to subtract the value of `_balancOfPartion` from `balanaceOfTotalSuppyByParition`. This means that the total supply of tokens in a partition is reduced by the amount of the `_valu`e. Therefore, `TotalSupllybyPartiton` is data-dependent on `_Value`.
