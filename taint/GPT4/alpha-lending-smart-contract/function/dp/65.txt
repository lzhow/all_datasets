Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity code, the variable `_token` in the function `getUserAccount` is an `ERC20` token that is used to index into the `pools` mapping to retrieve the corresponding `Pool` struct. Similarly, in the function `calculateAlphaReward`, the variable `_token` is also used to index into the same `pools` mapping to retrieve a `Pool` struct. Since both functions use the `_token` variable to access the same `Pool` struct from the `pools` mapping, there is a data dependency relationship between `_token` in `getUserAccount` and `pool` in `calculateAlphaReward`. The state of `pool` in `calculateAlphaReward` depends on the address of `_token` provided to the function, which is the same address used in `getUserAccount` to interact with the `pools` mapping.
