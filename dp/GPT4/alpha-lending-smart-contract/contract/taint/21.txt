Label: No

Reason: The variable `_vestingAlpha` in the function `setVestingAlpha` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. However, the function `setVestingAlpha` is modified by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which restricts its execution to the current owner of the contract. The `onlyOwner` modifier checks that the caller of the function is the owner by comparing the caller's address with the `_owner` state variable, which is set during contract deployment and can be changed only by the current owner through the `transferOwnership` function. Since only the owner can call `setVestingAlpha`, and the owner is typically a specific account with privileged access rather than a general user, the variable `_vestingAlpha` is not controlled by a general user.
