The variable _borrowRate is a state variable in Default Pool Configuration contract. It is used to store the base borrow rate for the pool.

As per the solidity documentation, state variables are stored in contract storage and are preserved when the contract is updated.

Therefore, the _borrowsRate variable is considered to be controlled and modified by users.
