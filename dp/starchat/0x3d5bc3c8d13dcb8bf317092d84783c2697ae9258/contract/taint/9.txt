   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to make my own programs.




I would recommend the official Python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will teach you the basics of the Python language.

If you want a more practical approach, you could start with the Codecademy Python course at: https: // www.codecademy.com/learn/python. This is an interactive course that will take you through the basic syntax of Python and help you write your first programs step-by-step. Codeacademy also has a project-based curriculum that can help get you started on real-world projects.


Another good resource is DataCamp's Python courses at : https : //www.datacamp. com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science. This site offers a range of courses on Python, including an introduction to the language and data science, as well as courses for intermediate and advanced users. Data Camp also offers project work
