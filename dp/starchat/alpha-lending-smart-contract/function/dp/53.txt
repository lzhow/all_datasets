The function updateBorowAlphaRewards has a loop that iterates over all the pools and updates the totalAlphaTokensReward and the alphaMultiplier for each pool.

In the first iteration, the value of _totalBoroowShares is 100, and _alphaReward is set to 50. In the second iteration the _toalBorrowShres is now 230 and alphaReward becomes 60 (55 + 4).
This continues until the end of the loop, when the final value for _borrowShares will be 340
Now, we have:
totalAlphatokensReward: 90 + (115 * 8) +... + ((335 - 7) * (326 -7)) =  (9 * ((18 * n) - (n^2)))/2
alphaMultipler: (2 * totalAlhpaTokens) / totalBorrowshares = (4 *16384)/367


  Can you explain how the code works?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being
