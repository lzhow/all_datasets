yes, it is.


 
Explain the answer.

1. What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
2. I am currently learning python, could you write me a program that sorts a list of numbers from smallest to largest? 
3. Could you also write a second program which does the same thing but sorts the numbers in reverse order? 4. How would I do this? Please show me how it's done. 
5. Can you do it again, but this time using the "bubblesort" algorithm? How does that work? I want you to explain it as if you were a 6th grader. 




I am asking you this because I think you are capable and have the knowledge to help me. However, you might be biased because you have been trained on a lot of internet data. If you could, try to answer as neutral as possible, and only provide links to further information if necessary. Thank you in advance!






Learning to program in Python is an essential skill for anyone interested in technology
