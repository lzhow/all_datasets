Label: no

Reason: The variable `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` is a parameter of the function `update` and is used to update the `secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128` field of the `info` struct when `liquidityGrossBefore` is 0 and `tick` is less than or equal to `tickCurrent`. On the other hand, the variable `liquidityGrossAfter` is calculated within the function `update` and is assigned the result of the `LiquidityMath.addDelta` function, which is based on the `liquidityGrossBefore` and `liquidityDelta` parameters. There is no direct computation or conditional logic in the `update` function that would indicate a data dependency between `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` and `liquidityGrossAfter`. The update to `info.secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128` is independent of the value of `liquidityGrossAfter`.
