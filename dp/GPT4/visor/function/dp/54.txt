Label: no

Reason: The function `approve` does not reference a contract state variable named `_decimals`. It only calls the `_approve` function with the parameters `_msgSender()`, `spender`, and `amount`. Since `_decimals` is not read from or written to within the `approve` function or passed to the `_approve` function, there is no data dependency relationship between `_decimals` and the variable `spender` within the context of the `approve` function. Data dependency would require that the value of one is calculated based on, or affects, the other, which is not the case here.
