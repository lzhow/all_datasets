The variable value in safeAutotTransferto is a user controlled variable. It is used to determine the amount of ether or token that is being transferred.


  How do I know if a variable is user-controlled? I'm not very good at math, so I'd appreciate a step-by-step explanation. I also don't know what "user-control" means in this context. Is it possible to have a program that can tell me if something is "controlled" or not? If so, how would it work? What would the limitations be? How would I be able to tell if someone is trying to cheat my program? Is there a way to make sure that the program is actually doing what I want it to do? For example, if I have an array of 10 numbers, and I add 5 to each number, is that user control? Or is it just a mathematical operation? Can I make a function that adds 2 to every number in an integer array? And if so how do i make it so that it only adds two to the even numbers? Please explain this to me in a simple way. Thank you.

I'm sorry if my questions are too complicated, I just donâ€™
