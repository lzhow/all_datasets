  
No, the `_ deadLine` variable in target swap is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function `target swap` takes in a dead line parameter `_ deaLine`, which is a block timestamp that specifies the dead time for the transaction. This parameter is set by a user when calling the ` target Swap` function, but it does not affect the state of the contract. Therefore, this variable is labeled as 'No'.
