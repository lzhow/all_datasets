The variable a in function `mod` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a can be influenced by other variables and functions in smart contract. For example, if a is user-controlled, and the other variable b is also user controlled, then the final value that is passed to `require(0 <= b && b < a)` can still result in a value for a that would cause the require statement to fail.


  Can you explain how the analysis works? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "user-controllable".
