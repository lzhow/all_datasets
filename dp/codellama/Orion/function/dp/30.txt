  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the address(0x0) has enough balance to make the call. This check is performed before the actual call is made, so the balance of the contract is not affected by the value of `data`. Therefore, `success` and `returnData` are dependent on `target` but not on`value`.
Similarly, in function 2,`require( isContract (target) )` checks whether the target address is a contract. If the check fails, it throws an error. However, this check does not affect the execution of`target. call{value:value}(data)`. Therefore ` success`and ` returnData ` are also dependent only on target but are independent of value.
Therefore, we can conclude that ` retundata ` is data-dependent on both ` target ` and` value `, but ` value` is only data -dependent ` on  `  target`.
