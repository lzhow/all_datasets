  
The label is 'No'.

In the constructor function, the `_name` and `_symbo` variables are passed as arguments to the `ERC-2`0 constructor, which initializes the contract's name and symbol. These variables have no direct relationship with the other variables in this function.
On the contrary, `_strateg`y and `approv`alDelay are local variables that are defined in `this` function and are used to initialize the strategy and approvall delay variables. They are also not directly related to `_ symbol`.
Therefore, there is no data dependence between `_ approva`lDelay and`_symbol`.
