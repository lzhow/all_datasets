Label: no

Reason: The variable `errorMessage` in the function `functionDelegateCall` and the variable `data` in the function `functionCall` are parameters of their respective functions. Each function has its own scope, and the parameters are not shared between them. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the two variables within the given code. The `data` variable is used to perform a low-level call in `functionCall`, while `errorMessage` is used to provide a custom error message in `functionDelegateCall` in case of failure. Since there is no interaction or data flow between these two variables, they are not data dependent.
