yes, it is.


 
Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on. I also want to use this as an opportunity to improve my english skills while doing this. Could you recommend me some good first steps? Also, are there any paid courses that I could take? If so, which ones and why did you pick them? Please be as specific as possible. Thank you.  I have also heard that Udemy has a lot of courses on Python, do you have any recommendations for that? Thankyou. Also if you could recommend some other coding languages that are easier to start with that would be great. Again, please be specific. Lastly, if there are any coding communities that you think I might benefit from I would appreciate it if youe could mention them. If there is something in particular you would like me to focus on I will be sure to put my best effort into it. Finally, I know you said you are tire of simple tasks, can you give me a list of those? Maybe there's something simple I can do to unblock
