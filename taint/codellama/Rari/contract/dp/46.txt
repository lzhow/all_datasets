In the `add` function, the value of `c` is calculated as `a +b`. The value `b` comes from the expression `mul( d ripRate, block Number -d ripStart, " d r i p T o t a l overflow")`. Therefore, ` d ri p Total _` depends on ` dri p Start _`.
Similarly, in `sub`, the result of the subtraction is assigned to ` c`, which depends directly on both ` a` and ` b`.
