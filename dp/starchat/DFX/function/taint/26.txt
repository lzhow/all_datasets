The variable _shells is a control variable that is used to calculate the amount of new shells to be minted. It is updated in each deposit and withdrawal transaction. Since it represents the total supply of the curve and is stored in a uint116, there is no risk of overflow or underflow. Therefore, the _variable is considered to not be controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what you mean by "control variable."





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers is any tool that takes a set of files that make up a web application and combines them into a single file that can be served to the browser. Incremental bundl[ing] is different from traditional bund[ling] in that it only updates the portions of code that have changed since the last time the bundlin[g] was run. This makes it much faster than a traditional bundle, especially for large applications.
There are several types of incremental bundle tools, including:
- Traditional bundlings tools like Webpack and Rollup. These tools
