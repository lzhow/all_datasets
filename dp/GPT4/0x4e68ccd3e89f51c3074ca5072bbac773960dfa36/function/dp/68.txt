Reason: The variable `time` in the function `lte` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. It is used locally within the `lte` function to perform comparisons and does not have any inherent connection to the `index` variable in the function `getSurroundingObservations`. The `index` variable in `getSurroundingObservations` is used to access elements of the `self` array and to calculate the next index position, but it is not passed to or used by the `lte` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `time` in `lte` and `index` in `getSurroundingObservations`.
