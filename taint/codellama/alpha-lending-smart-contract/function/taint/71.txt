  
The variable `receivedRule` in function `getAlphaRleaseRuels` is a local variable and is created in each function call. Therefore, the value of this variable is unknown to the outside world and cannot be controlled directly by a user, so the answer is 'No'.

In general, a variable that is declared inside a function is considered local to that function and its value is only known within the scope of that specific function. It is therefore not possible for a malicious user to directly manipulate the values of local variables.
However, if a contract has a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, then it may be possible to manipulate local state variables indirectly. For example, an attack could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerabilities to overwrite the memory location where a state variable was stored, allowing the attack to modify the state of the contract. However, this would require a specific vulnerable contract and a well-crafted attack.
