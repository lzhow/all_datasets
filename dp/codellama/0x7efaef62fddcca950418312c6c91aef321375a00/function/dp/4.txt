The variable 'value' in function `_safeTranfer` is not dependent on variable  ` balance 1`in function  'burn'.
This is because the value of ` value`is passed as an argument to the `_ safeTransfe` function, and it is used to call the `token. call` method. This method does not use the balance of the token, so the data flow from ` balanc e0 ` to ` _ safeTansfer ` is independent.
