The variable `wordPos` in the function `flipTick` is data dependent on the variable `tickSpacing` in the same function. This is because `wordPos` is assigned the result of an expression that includes `tick / tickSpacing`. The division operation directly involves `tickSpacing`, and thus any changes to `tickSpacing` would affect the value of `wordPos`.
