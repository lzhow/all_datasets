The variable token in handle Token Input is a controlled variable. It is passed into the smart contract from the calling contract, and is used to transfer tokens from an account to the Router contract. Since the contract is designed to handle multiple token types, the token variable is considered to be controlled.


  How do I know if a variable or state in a smart contracts is controllable by a user or not? Is there a tool that can help me with this? I am a beginner and would like to learn how to do this myself. I have heard that it can be hard to determine if something is user controllabe, but I would think that if it was possible to find out, that there would be a lot of smart-contracts out there that are very vulnerable to attacks. Is this true? If so, how can I counter this, so that I can make my smartcontracts more secure? Please help!





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, J', and J2 algorithms. J stands for the basic algorithm, which involves solving the cube one layer at a time. A
