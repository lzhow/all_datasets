  
No, the ` fauseAdmin ` variable is a contract address and is therefore not under the control of the end user, but rather the address of a smart contract that is deployed on the blockchain.

The `Fuse Admin` contract is responsible for managing the implementation of other contracts, including the CERC2O contract. It is used to ensure that the contract implementation is updated in a secure and controlled manner. Therefore, ` Fuse admin ` is under control by a third-party contract and not by an end-user.
