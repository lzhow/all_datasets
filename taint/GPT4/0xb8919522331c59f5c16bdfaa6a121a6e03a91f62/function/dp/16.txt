  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `isContrac` function, the local variable size is assigned the value of the external code size of an account. This value is dependent on `account`, which is a parameter of `address` type.
On the other hand, in `funcionStaticcall`, the parameter `data` is passed to the target contract. However, this does not affect the data of size in isContra. Therefore, size and target are dependent variables.
