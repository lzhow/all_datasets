  
The variable 'poo' is a state variable in this contract. It is defined as a mapping from token addresses to Pool structs.

In this case, the 'pool' variable is created by calling the constructor of the contract, which initializes the mapping with the address of each token and the corresponding Pool structure. Therefore, this variable can be controlled only by a user who has the ability to call the contructor of this smart contract and pass the token address as an argument.
