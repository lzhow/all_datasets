Explanation: The variable `amountsIndex` in the function `_swapCurve` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of `0` if `supportingFee` is true, otherwise, it is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `supportingFee` is determined within the function and is not controlled by the user. Therefore, the variable `amountsIndex` is not controlled by the user.
