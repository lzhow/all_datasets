Label: no

Reason: The variable `targetAtOrAfter` in the function `binarySearch` is determined within the scope of that function and depends on the parameters `time`, `beforeOrAt.blockTimestamp`, and `target`, as well as the result of the function `lte`. It does not have any direct or indirect dependency on the variable `tickCumulatives` in the function `observe`. The variable `tickCumulatives` is defined in a separate function and is used to store the results of the `observeSingle` function calls, which are based on the parameters passed to `observe`. There is no shared state or parameter passed between `binarySearch` and `observe` that would create a data dependency between `targetAtOrAfter` and `tickCumulatives`. Each function operates independently with their own set of parameters and local variables.
