The variable `_oGLiq` in the function `viewTargetSwapData` is not dependent on the variable `nGLiq_` in the same function. The value of `_oGLiq` is calculated based on the values of `oBals_` and `nBals_`, which are independent of `nGLiq_`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `_oGLiq` and `nGLiq_`.
