Label: yes

Reason: The variable `collateralAmount` is calculated by the function `calculateCollateralAmount`, which takes `liquidateAmount` as one of its arguments. The `liquidateAmount` itself is derived from `liquidateShares` through the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount`. Therefore, any changes to `liquidateShares` will affect `liquidateAmount`, which in turn will affect `collateralAmount`. This establishes a data dependency relationship between `collateralAmount` and `liquidateShares` within the `liquidateInternal` function.
