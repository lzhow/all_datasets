In this case, the relationship between the `_allowed` contract variable and the `want` function is not immediately apparent. However, we can infer that there is a potential data dependence between these two entities based on their names and their usage in context.
  The `_allows` variable is likely used to store the allowance of a particular token, while the`wants` method is used for retrieving the balance of the token. Therefore, it is possible that the value of `_alows ` is dependent on ` wants` because it may be used as an input to the latter.  However , without further information about the implementation of these functions and variables, this relationship cannot be confirmed.
