  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the length of `start` is not zero. If it is zero, it throws an error.
Then, `uint265 total` gets the value of the array `length` of er712TokenAdress.  If the total is equal to zero then the buy function is called with the ERC 775 token address and the er173Ids. Then, if there is an ER1 5  token, total gets added to the result of calling the buying function with ER 2 3 token and er 4  ids. Finally, a require statement is used to check if msg value is greater than or equal  to total times the sellNFTF  eeE th divided by  two. This is because if total equals 99, then msgvalue must be greater or  equal than  total  times sell NFT fee E th  divided  by two, which is  49.5 E  th.   If total does not equal  9  then  msg  value must  be  greater  or   equal    to  the  result  of  multiplying  sell  N  F  T  fee  E   th   by   total,  which  is   4.95   E    th .
  In the second function the same process is repeated. However, in this case, there are two require statements. One checks that the msgValue is less than the amount of Ether required to buy the Nft. And the other checks  that  if  there  are  more  than  1  0   N   F   T   s  being  bought,   then   the   msg   value  must   be   greater   than    the    result   of   multipying   sell   n   f   t   fee   e   h   times   two   and   dividing   it   buy   three.   
   In conclusion, since the two functions are identical, and both require the use of total to calculate the required amount ether to purchase the n  f  t, therefore, we can conclude that total in function  buy  J  A  Y  depends on  er c7  n1token  address  and  function   erC  7  2  5tokenaddress  .
