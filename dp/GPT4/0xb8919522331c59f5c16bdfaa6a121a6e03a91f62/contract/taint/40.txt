  
The variable 'value' in function 'functionCallwithValue' is 'controlled by user'.

This is because the value of the 'amount' parameter is passed as an argument to the `functioncallwithvalue()` function. This means that the amount of Ether that is sent to a contract is determined by a user-supplied value. Therefore, the contract's state can be controlled or manipulated by an attacker who can provide a malicious value for the "amount" parameter.
