yes

The variable `rootKLast` in the function `_mintFee` is data dependent on the variable `_kLast` in the same function. This is because `rootKLast` is directly calculated from `_kLast` using the `Math.sqrt` function, which computes the square root of `_kLast`. The relevant line of code is:

```solidity
uint rootKLast = Math.sqrt(_kLast);
```

This line shows that the value of `rootKLast` is derived from the value of `_kLast`, establishing a clear data dependency relationship between the two variables.
