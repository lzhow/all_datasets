No. The variable `cTokens` in the function `claimRewards` is not data dependent on the variable `cToken` in the function `_setCompSupplySpeed`. 

The reason is that the variable `cTokens` is a parameter of the function `claimRewards` and its value is passed as an argument when calling the function. The value of `cTokens` is not influenced or derived from the value of `cToken` in the function `_setCompSupplySpeed`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
