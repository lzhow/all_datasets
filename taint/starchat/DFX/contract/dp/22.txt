   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python" is pronounced like the English word "benevolent."
Guido van Rossum began working on Python in 1989, a fact that has led to a negative reputation for the language.[1] Python 2.0 was released on February 3,  ̀18, and  Python  3.6.5 was release on September 9, ²017. Python is free and open-source software and has a large community of contributors.[3]
   
    To learn Python, you can start by reading the official Python documentation. It is very well written and provides a comprehensive guide to learning the basics of the programming languge.

    Another great resource is to attend a Python workshop. Websites like meetup.
