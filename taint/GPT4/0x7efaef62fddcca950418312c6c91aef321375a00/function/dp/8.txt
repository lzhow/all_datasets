The variable `liquidity` in the function `_mintFee` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve1`. The reason for this is that `liquidity` is calculated using the `rootK` variable, which is derived from both `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`. Specifically, `rootK` is the square root of the product of `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`. Since `liquidity` is computed using `rootK`, which in turn is directly dependent on `_reserve1`, any changes to `_reserve1` will affect the calculation of `rootK` and consequently the value of `liquidity`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `liquidity` and `_reserve1`.
