  
No, the `` variable in function ``_togglefUseAdminRight`` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function is called by a user, but the parameter is passed by another contract, so the value of the  variable is determined by that contract and not by any user input. Therefore, this variable should be labeled as 'No' (not controlled).
