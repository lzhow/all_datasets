The variable `b` in the function `mul` is not data dependent on the variable `errorMessage` in the function `sub`. In Solidity, data dependency implies that the value of one variable is derived from or influenced by the value of another. In this case, `b` is an input parameter to the `mul` function, and it is used to perform a multiplication operation. The variable `errorMessage` is an input parameter to a different overloaded version of the `sub` function, which is used to provide a custom error message in case the subtraction operation fails due to an overflow. There is no interaction or dependency between these two variables within the scope of the provided code, as they are used in separate functions and serve different purposes.
