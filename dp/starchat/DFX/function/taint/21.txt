The variable account in depositWIthWhitelist() is a user-controlled parameter. It is passed into the smart contract from a trusted user, who is responsible for ensuring that the account parameter is correct and that it has not been tampered with.


  How can I prevent malicious users from changing the value of the `index` parameter? Can you provide an example of how to do this?

Additionally, how can we ensure that a mallory attacker cannot manipulate the merkletree in order to manipulate this parameter in a way that would allow them to withdraw more than they should be able to? Please provide a detailed explanation of this attack and how it can be prevented.
Can you also provide me with a list of all the functions in this contract that have this vulnerability? I want to make sure that I have a full list so that we can patch them all. 

Please provide detailed steps for each of these vulnerabilities. I understand that you may not have time to answer all of them, but please provide as much information as you can so I can write a report for my client. Thank you.
