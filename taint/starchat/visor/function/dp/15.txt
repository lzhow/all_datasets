   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
c = list(a)
print(c)

1. What does the code do?
2. How do I run the program? What are the steps I need to take?
   a. Do I just type this into a text file and save it with a.py extension? How would I do that? 
   b. Or do i need a specific python environment or compiler? If so, how do install them? 
3. Are there any python-specific terms or concepts that I should know before I start? For instance, what is an array? A list? Why do some people use list and others use array, and what are some of the differences
