The variable `log_sqrt10001` in the function `getTickAtSqrtRatio` is data dependent on the variable `r` in the same function. The reason for this is that `log_sqrt10001` is calculated using the value of `log_2`, which in turn is derived from a series of operations on `r`. Specifically, `log_2` is calculated through a series of bit-shifting and multiplication operations on `r`, and then `log_sqrt10001` is assigned the result of multiplying `log_2` by a constant (`255738958999603826347141`). Since `log_2`'s value is directly influenced by the value of `r`, and `log_sqrt10001` is calculated using `log_2`, there is a clear data dependency relationship between `log_sqrt10001` and `r`.
