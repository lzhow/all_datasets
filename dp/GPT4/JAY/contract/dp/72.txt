The variable `amount` in the function `getBuyJayNoNFT` is not directly dependent on the variable `price` in the function `getLatestPrice`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `price` in `getBuyJayNoNFT`. However, it is possible that `amount` indirectly depends on `price` if the value of `price` affects the execution flow or behavior of the contract in a way that indirectly impacts the calculation of `amount`. Without further analysis of the contract logic, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
