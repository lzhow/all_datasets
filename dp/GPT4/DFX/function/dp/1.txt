The variable `_oGLiq` in the function `viewOriginSwap` is not data dependent on the variable `_length` in the function `viewOriginSwapData`. 

Reason: The variable `_oGLiq` is not directly assigned or used in any way that depends on the value of `_length` in the function `viewOriginSwapData`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
