In the `Comtroller` interface, the contract has a function called `enterMarketing` that takes an array of `cToken` addresses as input. This function allows the caller to enter the market and start earning interest on their deposits.
However, this function does not have any checks to ensure that the input `address` is a valid `CToken` address. Therefore, an attacker could potentially pass in a malicious address that could cause the system to behave unexpectedly.
