The variable `a` in the function `tryAdd` and the variable `b` in the function `tryMod` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. This means that each function has its own separate local variables `a` and `b` that do not interact with each other. When a function is called, the parameters are passed by value, creating a copy of the data for use within that function's scope. Since there is no shared state or interaction between these two functions in the provided code, there is no data dependency relationship between the variable `a` in `tryAdd` and the variable `b` in `tryMod`.
