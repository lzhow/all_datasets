Reason: The variable `size` in the `isContract` function is not controlled by the user. It is assigned a value based on the result of the `extcodesize` opcode, which is used to determine the size of the code at a specific address. This value is determined by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the state of the blockchain, not by any user input or interaction. The `extcodesize` opcode returns the size of the contract's bytecode if the address `_addr` is a contract, or zero if it is an externally owned account (EOA). Therefore, the value of `size` is determined by the blockchain state and the address being queried, not by the user.
