  
No, the `_ symbol` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is passed as an argument to `ER7C` constructor.

The `symbol()` function in `I ER7` interface returns the symbol of the token, which is set in constructor of `nO0DToken` contract. Therefore, `_symbo`l variable is a fixed value and cannot be changed by users.
