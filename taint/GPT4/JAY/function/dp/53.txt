Explanation: 
Based on the given code, there is no direct data dependency relationship between the contract state `_owner` and the variable `timeStamp` in the `updateFees` function. The code snippet provided does not show any interaction or assignment between these two variables. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they have a data dependency relationship without additional information or code analysis.
