The variable `curBalance` in the function `_swapCurve` is assigned a value based on the balance of `path[i + 1]` token. However, it is not clear from the given code whether the value of `path` is modified before `curBalance` is assigned. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between `curBalance` and `path` based on the given code.
