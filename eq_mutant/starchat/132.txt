There are multiple ways to compare the code. Here's a simple approach to check if two code blocks are equal:
1. Ensure that the formatting is exactly the **same**. This can be done by comparing the number of spaces between keywords and identifiers, and the use of braces and brackets. Make sure that there are no errors in indentation, quotes, or syntax. Use proper casing for keywords, class names, etc. as appropriate. Finally, check for **comments** and **documentation** to ensure they also match. 
2. **Run the program** with test cases, making sure the output matches the expected output. If there is any difference in output, then the codes may not be semantic equivalent. For example, if both code segments print "Hello World" to the console, it might still pass the test but if one prints "Goodbye" then it would fail. It's always better to debug a program than to rely on a test suite.
