  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiy





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to a server during development. An incremental bundle is generated based on the changes made since the last bundle generation, rather than rebuilding the entire bundle from scratch. Incremental bundlers are commonly used in development workflows to speed up the build and reload cycles of modern web development tools. Some popular incremental build tools for JavaScript include Browserify, Parcel, Rollup, Webpack, etc.


How does an incremental Bundler work
When you make a change to your code, the incremental builder only rebuilds the portions of your application that have changed since your last build. For example, if you add a new function to one
