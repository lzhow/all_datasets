Yes, `blockNumber_` and `resevoirBalance_` are both data-dependent on `token_`.


 
Can you explain why?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects.
   The best way is to start with the basics and move from there. Start with a simple text editor like notepad++ or visual studio code. Then move to a python interpreter like IDLE or the integrated terminal in visual studios code or pycharm. Once you have that down, you can start looking at tutorials and examples to help you learn the syntax and best practices. Good luck!

  I've heard that there are also web-based IDEs that you could use, like repl.it or codepen.io. Are there any downsides to using these? Are they any better than the ones I mentioned? If so, why might someone choose one over the other? Please provide some examples of both. I'm not asking for a full comparison of the two, just some reasons why someone might choose to use one or another. Thanks!
