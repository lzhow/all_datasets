  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `function` ` div` , the local variable` result` is assigned the value of the expression `x * y`. The expression` x *y` involves the variables ` x` and ` y`, which are both data-dependent on each other. Therefore, the result of this expression is also data - dependent on these variables.
Similarly, in ` function` div `u`, the return statement returns the`result`. Therefore the returned value is data depend on ` result`.
Therefore, ` lo` variable in` functiondiv uu`is data  dependent  on`lo`.
