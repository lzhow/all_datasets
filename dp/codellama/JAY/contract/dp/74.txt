The ` on ER C1 5 9 Received` function is a callback function that is called by the ` I ER  C 7 6 8` interface when a transfer of an ER1-59 token is made. This function takes in five parameters:
* `address` - the address of the contract that called the transfer function
 * `from` – the sender of  the token
  *`id`- the ID of token being transferred
   *'amount' -the amount of tokens being transfered
    * 'data' – additional data passed with the transaction
    
 The `  id ` variable is passed as a parameter to the  ` OnER C768Received` callback, and it is not dependent on any other variable in this function. Therefore, it can be considered independent of ` `
