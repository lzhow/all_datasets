To determine if any variables in a smart contracts are user control, you can use a tool like Mythril to analyze your contract. MythX is another option. These tools can help you identify any potential security vulnerabilities in your smart contact. Additionally, if you are using a library or framework, the library/framework owner may have made the decision to make certain variables user controllable. In this case, consult the documentation or contact the developer for more information. 

In general, user controls variables should be avoided whenever possible. If you need to use user variables, make sure you fully understand the implication of doing so and why it's necessary. It's also important to keep in mind that user variable can be modified by anyone, so it should only be used in situations where it makes sense. For example, a
