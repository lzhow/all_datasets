Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_totalSupply` is not explicitly present in the provided Solidity code. The `totalSupply()` function is typically a part of the ERC20 token standard, which returns the total supply of the token. However, in the `updateFees` function, there is no direct reference or assignment to `_totalSupply` that would indicate a data dependency on the variable `price`. The `price` variable in `updateFees` is used to calculate the new fees (`_sellNftFeeEth` and `buyNftFeeEth`), but there is no operation that would affect `_totalSupply` based on `price`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_totalSupply` and `price` within the `updateFees` function.
