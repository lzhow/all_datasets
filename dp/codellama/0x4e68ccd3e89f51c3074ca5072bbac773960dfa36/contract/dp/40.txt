Explanation:
In the `position` function, the value of `wordpos` is calculated by shifting `int(2^8)` bits to the right of the input `uint(192)`. The value `x` of type `Int1`6 is then calculated as `X = T /  (2 ^ 7)`.
Then, `BitPos`, which is of Type `Uint8`, is set to `T % (  Uint  )`.
Since `WordPos ` and ` BitPos  ` are both calculated from ` T `, and the values of these variables are used to index the array `self`, they have data dependencies.
