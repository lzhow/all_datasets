The variable _ x in function  get _ y is not dependent on variable result in base unit to curve decimal. This is because the _ _ i variable in get y function is used to iterate through the x array in x_p, and the result variable is only used in calculating the decimal value of the amount variable. Therefore, the value assigned to _ X is determined by the values in _X_P and not by result.
