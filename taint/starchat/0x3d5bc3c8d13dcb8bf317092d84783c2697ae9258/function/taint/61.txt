The variable descalcedMantisa is a local variable in function `divScalar` and is used to store the result of the division. It is declared as a `uint` type and has a value that is calculated using the `mulUInt` function, which takes two ` uint` types as input and returns a tuple containing an error code (of type `Math Error`) and the product of these two numbers.

However, the value of this variable is never directly returned by this function. Instead, this value is stored in a new variable called `rational` of type uint, and this new ` rational ` variable  is then returned as the output of ` div Scalar`.
Hence, we can conclude that the return variable rationale is controled by user
