Reason: The variable `feeGrowthInside0X128` in the function `_updatePosition` is calculated within that function using the function `ticks.getFeeGrowthInside` which takes parameters `tickLower`, `tickUpper`, `tick`, `_feeGrowthGlobal0X128`, and `_feeGrowthGlobal1X128`. These parameters are either passed directly into `_updatePosition` or are state variables that are accessed within the function. There is no direct reference to the `zeroForOne` variable from the `swap` function within the `_updatePosition` function.

The `zeroForOne` variable in the `swap` function is used to determine the direction of the swap and to make decisions within the `swap` function itself. It affects the flow and state changes within the `swap` function, but it does not have a direct impact on the calculation of `feeGrowthInside0X128` in the `_updatePosition` function.

Since there is no direct or indirect reference to `zeroForOne` when calculating `feeGrowthInside0X128`, and the two variables are used within separate functions that do not share state dependent on each other, they are not data dependent.
