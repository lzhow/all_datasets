   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but Python seems so much easier. Plus, I heard it's used in some really cool projects. So, how do I learn python??
   

  What are some good first projects I could do with Python? I'm completely new to programming. Can you recommend some beginner-friendly projects? And if I want to go further in depth, what would you suggest? Please provide a list of links or resources you think would be helpful. Thank you!

  
  Python is an easy language to get started with, and there are many beginners-focused projects available. Here are five beginNER-Friendly projects that you can start with:

1 - Automate the Boring Stuff with python: This is probably the most begin-ner friendly project out there. It teaches you how you to use python to automate boring tasks.
2 - Python Crash
