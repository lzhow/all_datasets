In the `pairForCure` function, the value of `tokenB` is passed as an argument to the method `findPoolForCoins` of the interface `ICurvRegistry`. This method returns a value that is stored in `pools`.
Then, in  the`getAmoutOutCurre` method, `factory` and `to` are passed to ` pairforCurv` as arguments, and the returned value is assigned to`pool`.  The value returned by ` getAmountoutCurre` depends on ` factory`and ` to`. Therefore,` pool`is data-dependent on` factory `and` to `.
