The variable `data` in the function `_safeTransfer` is used to store the return data from the `token.call` function call. It is a local variable within the `_safeTransfer` function and its value is determined by the success of the ERC20 token transfer operation, which is independent of the variable `_token1` in the function `skim`.

The variable `_token1` in the function `skim` is a local variable that holds the address of the second token in the pair (token1). It is used to perform token transfers from the contract to a specified address (`to`). The operations involving `_token1` in `skim` are related to adjusting token balances and do not affect the `data` variable in `_safeTransfer`. 

Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `data` in `_safeTransfer` and `_token1` in `skim`.
