Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `sendValue`, the variable `success` is set as a result of the `recipient.call{ value: amount }("")` operation. This operation attempts to send `amount` of Ether to the address specified by `recipient`. The success of this operation, and thus the value of the `success` variable, directly depends on whether the `recipient` can receive the Ether. If the `recipient` address is a contract that rejects the transfer or runs out of gas, the call will fail, affecting the value of `success`. Therefore, `success` is data dependent on `recipient` because the outcome of the operation that defines `success` is influenced by the address held in `recipient`.
