In the given code, the `index` variable is passed as an argument to the contract function `isWhitlisted`. This means that the value of ` index` is determined by an external entity, and it cannot be controlled directly by a user within the smart contract. Therefore, we can conclude that `  index ` is uncontrolled by user and the answer is No.
