Reason: The variable `borrower` in the function `liquidateBorrowAllowed` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is part of the contract's interface and can be called by external users. The value of `borrower` is provided by the user who calls the function, which means it is controlled by the user.
