Label: no

Reason: The variable `numerator` in the function `_mintFee` is calculated using the variables `_reserve0`, `_reserve1`, `totalSupply`, `rootK`, and `rootKLast`. It does not directly use the variable `_token1` from the function `swap`. The variable `_token1` in `swap` is used to reference the second token of the pair and is involved in transferring tokens and updating balances, but it does not influence the calculation of `numerator` in `_mintFee`. The `numerator` is dependent on the liquidity pool's reserves and total supply, which are not directly modified by the `_token1` variable in the `swap` function. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between `numerator` and `_token1`.
