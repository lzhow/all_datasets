Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `scalar` in the function `divScalarByExp` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function, which means its value can be determined by the caller of the function. However, without further context or information about how the value of `scalar` is obtained, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not. Therefore, the label for the variable `scalar` is "unknown".
