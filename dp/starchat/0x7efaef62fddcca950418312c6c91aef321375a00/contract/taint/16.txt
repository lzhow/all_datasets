   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and serving of web content works under the hood. Thanks!   An incremental bundlers job is to take all the files that make up a web application and combine them into a single file that can be served to the browser. This makes it easier for the browsers to cache the content and make it load faster. It also makes the development process easier as you only need to make changes to one file and the incremental bundle will update the changes in all of the other files. An example of a popular incremental web bundiler is webpack. Other popular bundilers include browserify and parcel. These are just a few examples of incremental bundles. They are used by many popular frameworks like react, angular, and vue.js
