  
No, the `_owners` variable in this function is a private variable and is therefore not directly controlled or manipulated by a user, but rather by other internal functions within the contract.

The `_owenr` is set to the address of the owner of this contract in its constructor, and it can only be changed by calling the `updateDevwallet` function, which is only accessible to an owner. Therefore, `_owned` can be considered as a controlled variable by an internal function rather than a direct user input.
