  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `function` ` getAmoutOut`, the expression `uint denominatior =(reserverIn*1e3)+amountinWithfee` is calculated.
This expression is dependent on `amountWithFees` which is a variable in ` function` get AmountOut.  `AmountWith Fees ` is also dependent  on  the  variable  reservein  which  is   a  parameter  of  function  getreserves. Therefore, the denominater is data-dependent on reserve 0.
