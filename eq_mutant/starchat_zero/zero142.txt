This appears to be a Java function. Semantic equivalence would mean they would output the exact same thing given identical inputs. The code itself appears equivalent, with the exception of the use of `abs()` in the mutated code. However, `Math.abs` and `java.lang.Math` are both in `Java.math` which is a standard library that contains various mathematical functions and constants. Thus, while the function may have its effect, it is semantic and not syntactic. Java does not require you to import these unless you explicitly use them.
