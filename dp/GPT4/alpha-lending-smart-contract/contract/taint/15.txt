Label: No

Reason: The variable `_owner` in the `Ownable` contract is set during the deployment of the contract to the address that deploys the contract, which is typically the contract's creator. After deployment, the control over `_owner` is governed by the functions `renounceOwnership` and `transferOwnership`. The `onlyOwner` modifier restricts the execution of these functions to the current owner only. Therefore, a regular user cannot control the `_owner` variable unless the current owner explicitly transfers ownership to that user through the `transferOwnership` function. Thus, `_owner` is not directly controlled by any user but rather by the current owner of the contract, which is a specific privileged user.
