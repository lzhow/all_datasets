  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `updateContibutorrewards` function, the value of ` deltablocks ` is calculated as `sub_(getblocknumber(), lastcontributoblock[contriubutor])`. The `lastcontributerblock` variable is updated in `claimreards` and `updaterewards`. Therefore, `deltablocks`, which is dependent on ` lastcontibuter block`, is also data-dependent on`get blocknumber`.
