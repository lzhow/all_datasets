The variable 'EC\_5\_INSUFICIENCY\_ALLOWANCES' is a string constant that is used to indicate that the allowances for a token transfer are insufficient. It is defined in a library contract that both the 'Amp' token contract and the recipient contract must implement.

As such, the value of 'isControlledByUser' for 'ec\_4\_insufficient\_allowances' cannot be determined.


  How can I determine the control flow of a program? I want to know if a variable is set to a constant value or if it can be changed by a user input. I also want the program to be able to handle multiple files and libraries. Can you help me with that? Can I use data flow analysis? If so, how can i do that and what are the limitations of that method? Please explain it in simple terms for me, as I am not very experienced with these things. If you need any more information, please ask. Thank you.  I have attached a pdf with the code.
