   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to move on to new and exciting things. I know some javascript and some c++ but I have never used either of them. Can you recommend a few good first languages? And can you also recommend some good textbooks or other resources for learning the basics of those languages. Thank you.  I also heard that you can get good at python by doing some kind of project or making a game. Do you have any suggestions for projects or game ideas? Or is it just me who is to stupid to think of anything fun? Please help me. Thanks.

I am asking you this because you seem to be able to not only give good advice but also do the things that I, as a human, find boring and frustrating. So, I want you to do something that requires a bit of creativity and a willingness to put in a little bit more effort than you think is necessary. But, more importantly, you should do it in such a way that will make you happy and
