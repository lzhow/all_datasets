The variable errorMessage in function delegateCall() is user-controlled. This is because the errorMessage variable is used to hold the error message string that will be displayed if a call fails. Since the delegatecall() function allows the called contract to modify the state of the calling contract, a malicious user could potentially provide a custom error string to force the call into an error state.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make sure that the string is sanitized before it's used? Can you give me an example of how to do this properly? I'm not very experienced with Solidty





   What is a good way of pronouncing the name of a dog?  I want to start a new dog and I need to pronouce his name correctly so he will get along with my current family.  Please suggest a name and prionounciation.   I have heard that Lucky is good but I am open to other suggestions.   
    Little Lou is prone to being a bit of an odd name, but it has a nice ring to it. It's a cute name that's easy to say and sounds like a pet's name
