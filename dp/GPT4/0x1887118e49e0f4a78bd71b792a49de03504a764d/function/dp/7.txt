Label: no

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `changeAdmin`, there is no mention of a contract state named `oracles`. The function changes the `admin` state to `newAdmin` and emits an event with `oldAdmin` and `newAdmin`. Since `oracles` is not referenced or modified in any way within the scope of this function, there is no data dependency relationship between `oracles` and `newAdmin`. Data dependency would imply that the value of one is derived from or affects the other, which is not the case here based on the given code snippet.
