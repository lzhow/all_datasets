Reason: The variable `amount1` in the `mint` function of the `PancakePair` contract is indirectly controlled by the user. This variable represents the amount of token1 that the user is contributing to the liquidity pool. When a user calls the `mint` function, they are expected to have already sent an amount of token0 and token1 to the contract. The contract then calculates the amounts `amount0` and `amount1` based on the difference between the current token balances of the contract and the stored reserves (`_reserve0` and `_reserve1`). Since the user is responsible for transferring the tokens to the contract before minting, they have control over how much of each token is sent, and therefore, they indirectly control the value of `amount1`.
