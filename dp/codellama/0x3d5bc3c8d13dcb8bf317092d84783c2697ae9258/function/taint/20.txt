  
The variable 'redemmer' in function 'reddemAllowd' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the redememer is a user-controlled variable. It is passed as an argument to the 'enterMarkts' function, which is called by a smart contract. Therefore, the value of the `redemer' variable is determined by user input and is therefore controlled.

In contrast, other variables such as `cToken` and `mintAmount` are not user controlled because they are passed to functions as arguments but are defined within the contract and are therefore not determined directly by users.
