Yes, the variable `total` in the function `buyNFTs` is data dependent on the variable `erc721TokenAddress` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of `total` is assigned the length of `erc721TokenAddress` using the statement `uint256 total = erc721TokenAddress.length;`. Therefore, the value of `total` depends on the value of `erc721TokenAddress`. Any changes in the length of `erc721TokenAddress` will affect the value of `total`.
