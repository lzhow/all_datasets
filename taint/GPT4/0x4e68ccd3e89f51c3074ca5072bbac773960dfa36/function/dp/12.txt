yes

The variable `delta` in the function `transform` is directly calculated using the parameter `blockTimestamp` and the property `last.blockTimestamp` from the `last` object, which is an `Observation`. The `last` object is assigned in the `write` function as `self[index]`, and the `blockTimestamp` parameter in the `write` function is used to update the `self[indexUpdated]` with the new `Observation` returned from `transform`. Since the `blockTimestamp` from `write` is passed to `transform` and used in the calculation of `delta`, there is a data dependency relationship between `delta` and `blockTimestamp`.
