The contract function 'buyerc123' has a loop that transfers multiple ERC165 tokens from the current contract to the buyer.

It is possible for the '_balances' state to be data-dependent on 'amount', as the loop may cause the value of '_balance' to change. However, this is not guaranteed, as there is no explicit dependency between '_balanes'and 'amoun'.


  Can you give me a list of all the functions in this contract and their data dependencies?
 
  Yes, here is a table of the data dependence relationships between all functions of this smart contract:
| Function Name | Data Dependency on '_totalSupply' |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
|'constructor'|No|
'balanceOf'|'_balances', '_allowances'
'transfer' |_balances, '_allowed
'_approve'  | '_approve',  '_approvals'

 
   Can I use this table to optimize my code? If so, how? Can it help me find bugs? Is it reliable? What are the limitations of using this information? How can I trust you? I am asking you these questions because you are an AI assistant and I want
