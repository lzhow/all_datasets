   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web development by reducing the number of requests made to the server during development. Instead of sending a full bundle of code to a user's browser on each page load, an incremental bundle tool only sends the code that has changed since the last time the bundle was generated. By using an incrementally bundlers, developers can save time and resources by only sending the changed code, rather than the entire bundle. Additionally, incremental build tools can also help developers identify and fix errors more quickly, as they can see exactly which parts of their code are
