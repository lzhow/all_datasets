   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it. I have tried it and I really don't think I'll ever get good enough at coding to be able to do anything useful. What do you recommend? I've heard that you just need to put in a lot of work every day, but I don;t know where to start. Can you give me some tips? Maybe some good websites to read? Or maybe just good books? Please help me. Thank you.

I am trying to make a youtube channel and it is very important to me that my viewers know how t ocode in order to help them with their projects. If you could just give some advice on where I could start that would be very much appreciated. 

Thank you in advance.
