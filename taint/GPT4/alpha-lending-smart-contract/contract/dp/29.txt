The contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `totalShares` in the function `stake`. The reason for this is that the amount of new shares to be minted for the staker is calculated based on the current `totalShares` of the `AlphaStakePool` contract. The `_mint` function, which is called within the `stake` function, updates the `_balances` mapping to reflect the new balance of the staker's account after minting new shares. The calculation for the number of shares to mint uses `totalShares` as follows:

```solidity
if (total == 0 || totalShares == 0) {
    _mint(msg.sender, _amount);
} else {
    _mint(msg.sender, _amount.mul(totalShares).div(total));
}
```

If `totalShares` is zero, it means that there are no shares currently issued, and the staker will receive a number of shares equal to the amount they are staking (`_amount`). If `totalShares` is not zero, the number of shares to mint is proportional to the amount of AlphaToken (`_amount`) the user is staking relative to the total AlphaToken already in the pool (`total`). This proportion is then multiplied by the `totalShares` to determine the correct number of new shares to mint for the staker. The result of this calculation directly affects the `_balances` mapping when `_mint` is called, as `_mint` will update `_balances[msg.sender]` with the new share amount.

Therefore, the state `_balances` is indeed data dependent on the variable `totalShares` within the `stake` function.
