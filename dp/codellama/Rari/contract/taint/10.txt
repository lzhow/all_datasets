  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the `mul` function, the value of `a` is passed as an argument to the contract, and the code does not modify it. Therefore, `b` and `errorMessage` are the only variables that can be controlled directly by a user, but the values of these variables are not used to determine the result of the multiplication.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether the output of this function is under the control of a single user or not.
