How can a human tell the difference between a benign program and a sus? What are some signs that a piece of code could be malign? Is there a way to automatically detect maliucious code? Can I use AI to do this for me? Or do humans need to be involved in this process?

I want a set of rules and best practices that I could follow to ensure that my code does what I intend it to. But I also want the ability to trust that the code I write is
