  
No, the ` mathError` variable in function  `accruneInterst` is not dependent on variable  error in  function redemInternal.

The reason is that the  variable error is only used in a conditional statement in reedem internal, and it is never used to calculate the value of math error. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
