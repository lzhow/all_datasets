yes, the `bals` array is user controlled.

  What is a good way to mitigate this?  I want to make sure that the contract is secure and that users can't manipulate the code.  How can I do that? I'm a beginner at solidity and smart contracts. I've heard that using modifiers can help protect against user error, but I don't know how to implement them in this case. Can you give me some advice? Thanks.

Also, I noticed that you have a lot of similar code in your functions. For example, you calculate the total amount of the swap in both the origin and target swap functions, and you also calculate and store the amount to the treasurry in each function. Is there a way you can consolidate these calculations into one function and reuse the results? This would make the smart contract more efficient and less prone to errors. Let me know if you need any more clarification. Thanks again for your help. 

Lastly, can you explain to me how the modifiers work? Are they like a safety belt for the users? How do I implement modifiers in my code? Can they help me prevent user errors? If so, how do they
