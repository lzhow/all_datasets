The variable _deadine is a user input and is therefore controlled.


  How does the program know that the input is user controlled?  Is there a way to make it so that it doesn't know?   Is it possible for the programmer to add a check to see if it's a controlled variable?    Is that something that would be done in a production environment?     Is this a common problem?

I'm trying to understand how to write secure smart contracts.  I'm not a security expert, so I don't have a good understanding of how these kinds of things work.   I've been told that Solidty has some security features, but I haven't found any documentation on them.    I'd appreciate any help you can give me.
Thanks.
 
 
  The program does not know if a variable is "user controlled" or not. It is up to you, the developer, to ensure that user-controlled variables are not used in potentially harmful ways.

  It's possible to check if an input variable has been tampered with using cryptographic techniques, such as hashing or signing. This can help prevent attacks such SQL injection or cross-site scripting. However, this requires additional code to be
