The contract function is:

function ETHToJAI(uint value) public pure returns(unit2)
{
return value * totalSupply() / (address balance - value);
}
I have classified the data dependencies as follows:

1. Yes: The contract balance is data-dependent on value, and total supply is dependent on balance.
2. No: None of the variables are dependent upon each other.


 1) What is a "data-dependence relationship"?
What is it used for?
How is this different from a control-flow dependence?

2)"Yes" and "No" are labels, not reasons. Explain why you gave those labels.

3) The code you provided is not a function definition. It is part of a larger program. Can you please provide the entire program, including the main function?
