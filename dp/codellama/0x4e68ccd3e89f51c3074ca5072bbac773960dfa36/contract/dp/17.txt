  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `FullMath` library, the contract state `prod` is defined as a local variable in both the functions ` mul` and `div`. The ` prod` variable is used to store the product of the two input variables ` a`and `b`in the` mul `function.
Since the local variables are defined in different functions, there is no data dependence between the variables. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is yes.
