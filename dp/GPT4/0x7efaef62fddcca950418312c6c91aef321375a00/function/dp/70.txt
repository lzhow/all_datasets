Label: no

Reason: The contract state `token0` is not data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `swap`. The variable `data` is used as an argument to the `IPancakeCallee(to).pancakeCall` function, which is a callback mechanism for the PancakeSwap protocol. However, `token0` is a state variable that represents the address of one of the tokens in the liquidity pair and is not modified or influenced by the `data` variable. The `data` variable's purpose is to pass arbitrary data to the `pancakeCall` function, and it does not interact with or change the state of `token0`. The `token0` variable is only read to perform the `_safeTransfer` operation and to get the balance of `token0` in the contract, but it is not modified or dependent on the contents of `data`.
