Reason: The variable `success2` in the function `sell` is used to store the return value of a low-level `call` to the `dev` address, which is transferring a portion of the Ether received from the `sell` function to the developer's address. This variable is only dependent on the success of the Ether transfer and is not directly related to any other state variables or their computations.

On the other hand, the variable `price` in the function `updateFees` is used to store the latest price from the `priceFeed`'s `latestRoundData` function. This price is then used to calculate the new fees for buying and selling NFTs within the contract.

There is no direct data dependency between `success2` and `price` because they are used in different contexts and for different purposes. `success2` is related to the execution of a transaction, while `price` is related to the retrieval and calculation of NFT fees based on external price feed data. They operate independently of each other within their respective functions.
