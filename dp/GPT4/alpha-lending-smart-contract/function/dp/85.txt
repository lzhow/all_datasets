In the `repayInernal` function, the value of ` payBackAmount ` is calculated using the` calculate RoundUp Borrow Amount` method, which takes the `_token` and `_share` parameters as input.
However, in ` receiveAlph`a, `borrowerGains` is not used as an input parameter for the calculation of` payBacKAmount`.
Therefore,`payBackAmoun`t is data-dependent on ` lenderGa`in.
