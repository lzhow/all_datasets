Label: no

Reason: The variable `amount1In` is calculated based on `balance1`, `_reserve1`, and `amount1Out`. It does not directly depend on `_reserve0` or any value that is derived from `_reserve0`. The calculation of `amount1In` is isolated from `_reserve0` and only involves the variables and state related to token1 (i.e., `balance1`, `_reserve1`, and `amount1Out`). Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `amount1In` and `_reserve0`.
