No. The variable `supplierDelta` in the function `distributeSupplierComp` is not data dependent on the variable `holder` in the function `claimRewards`. 

Explanation: The variable `supplierDelta` is calculated based on the values of `supplyTokens` and `deltaIndex`, which are not influenced by the variable `holder` in the `claimRewards` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
