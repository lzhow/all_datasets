  
No, the variables `_partiton` and `_operatordata` are independent.

The variable`_ partition` is a parameter of the `allowancByParition` function, which means that it is dependent on a specific partition. However, this partition is not directly related to the `_ operatorData ` variable, and it does not affect the value of `_ partition`.
On the other hand, `_ operatortData _` variable is an argument of` _ callPosttransfHooKs`function, but it has no direct relationship with the` allowancbyPartitio`n function. Therefore, it cannot affect` `_ partitin` value.
