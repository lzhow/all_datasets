  The `sender()` function is part of Solidty's `Context` library, which is included by default in all contracts. This function returns the address of whoever called the current function, either directly or indirectly through other functions.

In the case of a smart contract, the value of `this` inside the library function will be the calling contract itself, since it's the first function to be executed in response to a transaction.

However, if the call was instead to borrow on an cUSDC contract owned by account2, then ` address( this )` would evaluate as account3. In this case, account4 would be account5, and so on.


So, in summary, while the msg.sen
