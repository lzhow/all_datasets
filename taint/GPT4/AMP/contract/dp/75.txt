Reason: The contract state `_totalSupply` represents the total number of tokens in circulation within the contract and is modified by functions that mint or burn tokens (e.g., `_mint` function). The variable `_from` in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` represents the address from which tokens are being transferred. The function `_callPreTransferHooks` is called during a transfer operation to execute any additional logic before the transfer occurs, such as invoking hooks for token sender validation.

The `_totalSupply` is not directly modified or influenced by the `_from` variable within the `_callPreTransferHooks` function. The `_totalSupply` is only updated when tokens are created or destroyed, not during a transfer between addresses. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_totalSupply` and `_from` within the context of the `_callPreTransferHooks` function.
