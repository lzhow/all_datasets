Reason: The contract state `blockTimestampLast` is used to store the timestamp of the last time the liquidity reserves were updated. It is updated in the `_update` function, which is called by several functions such as `mint`, `burn`, `swap`, and `sync`, but not directly by the `skim` function.

The `skim` function is designed to transfer any tokens that have been sent to the contract address in excess of the recorded reserves (`reserve0` and `reserve1`). The `to` variable in the `skim` function is the address to which these excess tokens are sent. There is no interaction between `to` and `blockTimestampLast` within the `skim` function or any other function that `skim` calls that would create a data dependency relationship between them.

Therefore, `blockTimestampLast` is not data dependent on the variable `to` in the `skim` function.
