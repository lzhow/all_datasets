The variable `numerator` in the function `_mintFee` is data dependent on the variable `_kLast` because the calculation of `numerator` involves the variable `rootKLast`, which is derived from `_kLast`. The dependency chain is as follows: `_kLast` is used to calculate `rootKLast` using `Math.sqrt(_kLast)`, and then `rootKLast` is used in the calculation of `numerator` with `totalSupply.mul(rootK.sub(rootKLast)).mul(8)`. Since `numerator`'s value is directly affected by the value of `_kLast`, there is a data dependency relationship between them.
