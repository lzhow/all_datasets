The variable `_partition` in function `_callPartitonStrategyOpertorHook` is a state variable and is therefore controlled indirectly by Solidty's `view` keyword.


  How does Solidiy's view keyword control the state of a variable? Can you explain how it works?

I'm not sure if I understand the question correctly. Can explain it better? Please ask if you need further clarification.
Can you also provide me with a link to the solidity documentation about the view and pure keywords? I want to read more about it. 

Thank you





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How would you describe one? Is it like Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, or something else entirely? Explain to me why you think one is better than the others. I'm specifically looking to learn about how they work and which problems they solve. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to users. This allows for faster page loads and less data usage as the browser only needs to download a small amount of data instead of the entire application
