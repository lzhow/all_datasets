  
No, the `_status` variable is data-dependent on `_msg` and `_amount` variables in `nonReenterant` modifiers.

The `require` statement in `_nonreenterent` checks if the current status is equal to `_NOTENTRED` (1) and if it is, it sets the status to `ENTED`(2).
This means that the value of `_STATUS` is dependent on both `_MSG`and `_AMOUNT`.
Therefore, `_OWNER`is not dependent only on`_WITHDRAW`.
