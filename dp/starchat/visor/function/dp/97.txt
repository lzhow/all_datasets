The function call `return functioncallwithvalue(Target, Data,0, Errormessage);` is a call to a function named `FunctionCallWithvalue` that takes four arguments.

- The first argument is `Target`, which is an address that represents the contract that you want to call. This argument must be a constant, meaning that it cannot change during the execution of the program. If the value of this argument changes, the behavior of your program is undefined. Therefore, it is considered a "data-dependent" argument.


  What is data-dependence?
 
  Data-dependency is when one variable depends on another variable. In the example you gave, `Errormessage` depends `ErrorMessage`.
