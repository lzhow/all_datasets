Explanation: The variable `nextFeeUpdate` in the function `getFees` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned a value in the function `updateFees` based on the result of the `latestRoundData` function from the `priceFeed` contract. The value of `nextFeeUpdate` is updated by the contract owner or by the condition `timeStamp > nextFeeUpdate` in the `updateFees` function. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
