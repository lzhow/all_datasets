  
No, the ` balanceAdjuted` variable in function `swap` is NOT controlled  by user because it's calculated based on the current balance of the contract and the amount of tokens that are being swapped. It' s not possible for the balance to be controlled directly by a user, as it would require a malicious actor to have access to the smart contract' 's private key.

The `safe transfer` function is used to transfer tokens from the PanCakery contract to another address, and it ensures that the transfer is successful and that there are no errors. This function also checks that `to` address is valid and not equal to `token  ` or ` token  `.
