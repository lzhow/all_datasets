  
No, the variables ` amount ​​1 In` and `Amount  In ` are independent in function` swap`.

The reason is that the ` swap` function is a public function that allows users to swap tokens in a liquididy pool. It takes in two amounts as input: `amout0 Out`and ` amout1 Out`. The function then calculates the amount of tokens that will be swapped based on these inputs and the current liquiddity pool reserves.
In the case of the`swap`function, ` Amount  Out ` and` Amout  ` In are two independent variables that are used to calculate the amounts of token that need to be transferred. They are calculated based the the input amounts and current reserveres of each token in teh liquidty pool, but they do not depend on each other. Therefore, there is no data dependence between `Amoutn  out` `and Amou  nt  IN`.
