Explanation: The variable `tAmt_` in the function `originSwap` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the return value of the `Assimilators.outputNumeraire` function, which calculates the output amount based on the input amount and the assimilator's conversion rate. The user does not have direct control over the calculation of `tAmt_`.
