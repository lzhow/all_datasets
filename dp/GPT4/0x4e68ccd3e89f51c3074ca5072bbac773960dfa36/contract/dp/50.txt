yes

The variable `last` in the function `write` is data dependent on the variable `tick` in the function `write`. The reason for this is that `last` is an instance of the `Observation` struct, and it is used as an argument in the call to the `transform` function within `write`. The `transform` function takes `last` and `tick` (along with other parameters) and uses them to calculate new values for the `tickCumulative` field of a new `Observation` instance. This new `Observation` instance is then used to update the `self` array at the `indexUpdated` position. The dependency is established because the value of `tick` directly influences the calculation of `tickCumulative` in the new `Observation` created by `transform`, which is then assigned to the `self` array where `last` is also stored.
