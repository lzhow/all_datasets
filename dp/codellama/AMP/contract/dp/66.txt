  
No, the variables `_values` and `_operators` are independent.

The function ` _ callPost TransferHooKs` is called after the transfer of tokens, and it is used to call the `toTenantsReceived` function of the recipients of these tokens. This function takes as input the partition of transfer, which is not related to the `_ operator` variable.  The `_ value` parameter is also not dependent on `_ operators` because it represents the amount of transferred tokens and is independent of any other variable in this function.
