  
The variable 'to' in function 'depost' is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the 'from' address is passed as an argument to the deposited function, and the contract checks if it's a contract or not. If it isn't, the code will transfer the ERC-2O tokens from the address of the sender to this contract.
