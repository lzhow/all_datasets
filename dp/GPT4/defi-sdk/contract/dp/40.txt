The variable `amount1Out` in the function `callBytes` is data dependent on the variable `amountIn` in the function `getAmountsOut`. The reason for this is that `amount1Out` is assigned a value based on the `amounts` array, which is populated by the `getAmountsOut` function. Specifically, `amount1Out` is assigned `amounts[next]` where `next` is the index for the next step in the swap process. The `amounts` array is filled with the output amounts for each step of the swap, starting with `amounts[0]` being equal to `amountIn` and each subsequent `amounts[i + 1]` being calculated based on the previous `amounts[i]`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `amount1Out` and `amountIn` through the `amounts` array.
