The ` m int ` function is a part of the Panacea Pairs contract, which is used to mint new liquidities. This function updates the price of token  and the total supply of liquidty.
  The `  price  1  cumulativelast`variable is calculated by dividing the cummulative price by  the  total  supply  of  liquid  . The  ` cummulated  Price`is  calculated  using  a  formula  that  takes  into  account  both  token  0  reserve  amount  ,  Token  2  Reserve  Amount  And  Total  Supply  Of  Liquid  In  Contra  Ct  (  see  below  for  more  details  ).
   The   ` total   supply   of   liquid`   is   calculated   by   multiplying   the   amount   to  be  minted  with  two  factors  :   one  is   1   and  another  one   which  depends  on  whether  or  not  there  are  any  fees  to   be   paid  when  creating  new  liqudity  -  if  so  then  it  will  depend  upon  how  much  fee  has  been  paid.
