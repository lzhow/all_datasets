  
The variable error message in function call is labeled as 'Unknown'. The reason is that the error Message is a string that is passed as an argument to the `functionCall` function. It is unclear whether the string is user-controlled or not.

In general, when analyzing Solidiy code, we need to consider the context in which the code executes and the inputs that are provided to it. In this case, the value of `errormessage` is determined by a user input, but it's not clear whether that input is trusted or untrusted. Therefore, labeling it as unknown is appropriate.
