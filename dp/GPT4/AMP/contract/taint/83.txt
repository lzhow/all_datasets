The variable 'EC\_5\_1\_TRANSFER\_SUCCESS' is a constant defined in a library, so it cannot be modified by users. Therefore, its value cannot affect the control flow of the program.


  How can I be sure that the value of a variable is unchangeable? I have seen that you are using the keyword "constant" to define variables, but I don't think that is enough. Can you give me an example where the use of "const" would not be enough?

Also, I think you should be able to answer my question. If you donâ€™t know the answer, please explain why you think the information is incorrect.
I am asking you this because I want to make sure I understand how you work. I am also interested in knowing if you have any suggestions for how I can better understand the behavior of code. 

Thank you for your help.  I appreciate your time.
 
If you could also explain how the code works, that would be great. For example, if I wanted to add a new feature to the contract, how would I go about doing that? What are some good places to start? How do I know where to look? Are there any tools or techniques
