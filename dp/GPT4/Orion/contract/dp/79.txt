Label: no

Reason: The variable `factories` in the function `getFactoriesLength` is an array that holds the addresses of factory contracts. This function simply returns the length of this array and does not perform any operations that would affect or be affected by the state of any other variables outside its local scope.

On the other hand, the variable `amounts` in the function `_swapCurve` is a local array used to store amounts related to token swaps within that function. It is used to calculate the amounts for token exchanges and is dependent on the inputs and outputs of the swap operations within the `_swapCurve` function.

There is no direct data dependency between `factories` and `amounts` because they operate in different contexts and are not used to derive values from one another. The `factories` array is used to store and retrieve factory addresses, while `amounts` is used for calculations within a specific token swap operation. Changes to one do not affect the other.
