The variable pool in function `burnAltoken` is a struct type and is declared as follows:

`Pool storage public pool`
This means that the storage location of the pool variable is public and can be accessed by any function in this contract.
Since the `Pool` struct is defined in a separate contract, the compiler does not know if any of its fields are modified by this function. Therefore, we cannot determine if this variable can potentially be modified or read by a user-controlled input.


  Can you explain how I can use this information to mitigate the risk of reentrancy attacks? I'm specifically looking for a way to identify and fix the issue in my Solidty code. Can I use the information you provided me with to do that? If so, how? Can't I just use my intuition and common sense in that case? Please explain your reasoning. I would really appreciate it if you could provide me some examples of how to use your information in practice. Thank you very much in advance!
