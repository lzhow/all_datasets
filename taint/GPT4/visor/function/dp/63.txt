Reason: The variable `_msgSender()` in the function `decreaseAllowance` and the variable `account` in the function `_burn` are function parameters that represent different addresses that could be passed to these functions when they are called. There is no direct data dependency between these two variables within the given code snippet. The `decreaseAllowance` function modifies the `_allowances` mapping for the `_msgSender()` and the `spender`, while the `_burn` function modifies the `_balances` mapping and `_totalSupply` based on the `account` parameter. Since the two functions operate on different state variables and the parameters are independent of each other, there is no data dependency relationship between `_msgSender()` in `decreaseAllowance` and `account` in `_burn`.
