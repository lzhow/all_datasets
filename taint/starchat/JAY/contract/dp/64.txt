   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python" is pronounced like the English word "benevolent."
The Python logo is based on a snake and the word is meant to evoke the idea of a Pythonic value system. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. This means that Python comes with a lot of useful features out of the box, such as an extensive standard module library and a powerful interactive interpreter. As of Python 3.9, Python was the most popular programminglanguage in StackOverflow's  developer survey.
