  
No, the ` interest Accumulate` variable in function  `accruteInterst` is not dependent on ` actual Repay Amount`variable in ` liquidationBrowFres` function.

The reason is that the  variable  interest accumulated is calculated based on  the previous block number and the current blocknumber.  The variable actual repaid amount is also calculated using the same block numbers. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
