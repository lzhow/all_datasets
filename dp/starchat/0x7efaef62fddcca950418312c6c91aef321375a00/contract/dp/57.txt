Yes, `Mint` event is emitted when `Pandake` pair contract is called by `user` to `deposit` liqudity. In the `swap` function, the `_mint` and `_burn` functions are called to update the reserve balance of the two tokens. These two functions call the internal `_update` method to calculate the new price and liqulidity.

The `_safeTranfer` is a internal function that is used to transfer tokens from the contract to an address. It is important to note that the transfer function can fail for a number of reasons, including insufficient balance, so the return value of this function is checked to ensure that it succeeded.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are calculated?
 
  Yes, sure! The data dependence analysis is performed by analyzing the code of a smart contract and determining whether one variable or state depends on another. This analysis can be done using various techniques, such as control flow analysis, use-def analysis and data-flow analysis. For example, in this case, we can use a use def analysis to determine that `reserve` depends `balance`.
