In the constructor function, the `_name` and `_total_supply` variables are initialized with the values passed as arguments to the contract constructor. However, there is no direct data dependence between these variables and the variables in `_calPretransferhooks`.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether the two are dependent or not.
