Reason: The variable `data` in the function `_safeTransfer` is a local variable that is assigned the result of a low-level `call` to an external contract (specified by the `token` address). It is used to ensure that the token transfer was successful. On the other hand, the variable `rootK` in the function `_mintFee` is a local variable that is calculated based on the square root of the product of `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `data` and `rootK` within the given code snippet. `data` is not influenced by `rootK` nor does it influence `rootK`. They are used in separate functions for different purposes and there is no shared state or function calls that connect the two variables.
