It is set to the value of `I ERC 2 5 6 ( w et h ). balanceOf ( ad d r e s s ( this ) )` and is used to determine the amount of W E T H to withdraw.

The user does not have control over the contents of this variable, as it depends on external factors such as the current balance in Wrapped Ether (W ET H) in  this  contract and the withdrawal amount. Therefore, this is an uncontrollable variable.
