The variable c in function `divCeild` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of c is determined by dividing two user-controlled variables a and b. If either a or b is user controlled, then the result of the division will also be user controllable.


  How can I make sure that the variables are user controlable? I am trying to build a tool that can automatically generate tests for smart contracts. I want to make it as accurate as possible. Can you give me some tips on how to do that?

Also, how can you tell if a variable is controled by a user or not? Is there a way to determine that automatically? Or do I have to manually look at the code to see if it seems like a likely source of user inputs? If so, can a program do this automatically for me? Can it do so with high accuracy? How would you rate the accuracy of your tool in this regard? Please explain your methodology in great detail.
I am specifically asking for tips for Solidty code. But if you have tips that are generally applicable to all kinds of code, that would also help
