  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `if` statement checks if ` amountin` is equal to 0, and if it is, it reverts the transaction.
However, in both functions, ` numerators` are calculated using `reservesIn`, ` reservesOut`, and ` amountsIn`.
Therefore, if the value of ` reservein`,`reservenout`, or `amouninwithfee` changes, then the values of the numeratior and denominators will change, which will affect the result of`amountout`.
