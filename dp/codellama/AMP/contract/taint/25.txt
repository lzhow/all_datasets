  
The variable _ operator in function `is operatorFor Collatoral Manager` is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user who calls the `authorize operator` function.

In the code, the `_authorizerOperator` mapping is used to store the relationship between the operator and the token holder. When a new operator is authorized, a mapping entry is created in this mapping, where the key is `_tokenholder` and value is `true`. This means that the value of `_ operator ` can change based on the input of the authorizer operator function, which is a function that can only be called by users. Therefore, `_operater` can control the behavior of this function and is considered controlled.
