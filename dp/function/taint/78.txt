  
The variable 'b' in function 'div_' is a parameter of the contract and is therefore controlled  by a user of this contract.

This is because the value of ' b' can be passed in by any user who interacts with the smart contract, and it can affect the outcome of function. Therefore, the ' div _' function can only be called by users who have the ability to control the input value ' ' .
