Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `newImplementation` in the function `upgradeToAndCall` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is external and does not have any restrictions on who can call it within the provided code (apart from the `_authorizeUpgrade` internal function which is not shown in the code snippet), it is assumed that any user can call this function and provide the `newImplementation` address. Therefore, the `newImplementation` variable is controlled by the user who invokes the function.
