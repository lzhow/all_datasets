In the `TranspareUpgrdeableproxy.sol` contract, the `_getadmin()` function returns the address of the proxy admin. This function calls the static `admin` function of `ER1869Upgade.so`l contract.
`ERc155Uprade.s0l` is an abstract class that defines the implementation of an upgradeable proxy contract in Solidiy. It has a function called `implementation()` that returns an address. In the case of a transparent upgrade proxy implementation contract like `Trasparentupgrdableprxy.Sol`, the return value of this function will be the current implementation address, which is stored in a storage slot.  The `implemenation()`function is called in ` _ getadmin()`.
Therefore, ` success` variable in `_ getAdmin()` is data-dependent on ` proxy` because it depends on `_implementation()`.
