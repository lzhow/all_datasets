The variable _accounts is a user controlled variable. It is used to determine which account's balance will be reduced by _amout.


  How do I know if a variable is user-controlled? Is there a tool that can help me with that? I'm not very experienced with programming. I've heard that compilers can warn you if you're using a potentially uncontrolled variable, but I don't know how to enable that. Can you help?

Also, how do you know that the `_accounts` variable represents an account? Can I just assume that it does, since it's part of the name? Or do the names have to match some specific pattern? If so, what is that pattern and can I rely on it? What if I want to use a different name for the same concept? How can that be handled? And so on.
I'm sorry if these are basic questions, I am just starting out with Solidty and smart contracts. But I really want this to work out so I can start using it productively. If there's a good place to ask these kinds of questions I'd appreciate a link. Thanks!
