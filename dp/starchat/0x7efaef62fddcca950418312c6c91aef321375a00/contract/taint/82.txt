The variable PERMIST_TYPHASH is a constant in PAncakeERC  and is used to create the permit signature. It is therefore not user controlled.


  How can I check if a variable is user-controlled? I want to know how to do it myself, not just trust a tool. Can you give me a list of things to check?

I want you to write a short list with 5-15 items that I can check myself.
Please write the list in a way that is easy to understand and that can be done in 4-6 steps.  Please include examples for each step. For example:
"
1.) Check if there is an event for the change of the state. If there isn't one, the contract is most likely not upgradable.

2.) Look for modifiers that limit the execution of functions to only allow the owner to call them. This would mean that the variables are most probably user controllable. 

3.) If the functions are public, they are probably not upgradeable since people could just call the public function and change the logic. 

etc. etc. "
