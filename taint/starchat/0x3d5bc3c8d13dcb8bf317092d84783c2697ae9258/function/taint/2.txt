The variable seizetokens in seizable is a controlled variable.


  How does the analysis determine if a variable is user controlled?  What are some of the key heuristics or techniques used?

In computer programming, a control flow graph (CFG) is an abstract representation of a program's control-flow and is used to analyze and understand the program. A control structure is any statement that can be used for control transfer, such as conditionals (if-then-else), loops (for, while, do-while), and function calls.
A data flow analysis is performed on a CFG to determine whether the values of variables (or expressions) can change at runtime, and how they are used. In a user-controlled variable analysis, the goal is to identify whether a given variable or expression is directly controlled (i.e., written to) by a human user or device. This analysis can help developers identify potential security vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, or other issues that could arise from unauthorized access to sensitive data.


There are several techniques and heuristic used in user control analysis. These include:
1. Control-Flow Graph Construction: The program is modeled as a graph, where
