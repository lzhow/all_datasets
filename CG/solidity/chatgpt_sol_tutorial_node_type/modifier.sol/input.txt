You are a Solidtiy Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a Solidtiy code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has two attributes, type and value.
    
    The input file is 
    ```
    pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;

contract P {
    address public s;

    modifier mm() { 
        require(
            msg.sender == s,
            "not"
        );
        _;
    }

    function f() public view mm { 
        uint a = 10;
    }
}
    ```
