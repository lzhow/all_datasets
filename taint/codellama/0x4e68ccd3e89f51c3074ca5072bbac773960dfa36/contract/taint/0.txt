The variable 'secondsAge' is a parameter of the observe function, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user of this contract. This is because the value of 'secondAge ' is passed in as an argument to the 'observe' function when it's called. Therefore, the contract cannot guarantee that the values passed into the parameter are valid or safe.
