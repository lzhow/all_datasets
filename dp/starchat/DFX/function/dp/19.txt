   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:
`print("Hello World")`
what does the print function do and what is it printing? Is it just printing the words "Hello world" to the screen? Or is there more to it than that? Please include any and all examples you can think of. Thank you!

    To get started with Python, you should first download and install the Python interpreter. Python 3.11 is currently the latest version, and it is recommended to use this version
