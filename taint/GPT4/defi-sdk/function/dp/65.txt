  
The answer is 'No'.

In the `handleTokenInpu` function, the local variable`token ` is assigned the value of the` token` parameter, which is passed as an argument to the contract. This means that the data flow of ` token `is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in ` validateprotocolfeesignature`, the parameter ` output` is not used in any way, so it is also not a dependent variable. Therefore, there is no data dependence between `  token  ` and `   output  `.
