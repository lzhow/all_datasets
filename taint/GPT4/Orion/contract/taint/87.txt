Explanation: The variable `c` in the function `add` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is calculated based on the inputs `a` and `b`, which are parameters of the function. The value of `c` is determined solely by the logic of the function and does not depend on any user input. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
