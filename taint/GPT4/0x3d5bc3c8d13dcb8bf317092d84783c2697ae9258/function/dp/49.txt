Reason: The variable `srcTokensNew` in the function `transferTokens` is not data dependent on the variable `vars` in the function `redeemFresh`. The variable `srcTokensNew` is calculated within the `transferTokens` function using the `accountTokens[src]` mapping and the `tokens` parameter. It is used to update the balance of the source account after a token transfer operation.

On the other hand, the variable `vars` is a local struct variable defined within the `redeemFresh` function. It is used to store temporary values during the execution of the `redeemFresh` function, which deals with the redemption of tokens. The `vars` variable and its fields are scoped to the `redeemFresh` function and do not interact with or affect the `transferTokens` function.

Since there is no interaction or shared state between `srcTokensNew` and `vars`, there is no data dependency relationship between them. Each function operates independently with its own set of parameters and local variables.
