Yes

The variable `amountsOut` in the function `getAmountsOut` is data dependent on the variable `pair` in the function `getAmountOut`. This is because `amountsOut` is calculated by iteratively calling `getAmountOut` for each pair in the `pairs` array, passing the `pair` and `direction` as arguments. The output of `getAmountOut`, which directly depends on the `pair` provided, is then assigned to the corresponding index in the `amountsOut` array. Therefore, any changes to the `pair` variable would affect the calculation of `amountsOut`.
