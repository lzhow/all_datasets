Can you explain what a "data dependency" is?
 
  A data dependence is a relationship between two or more variables in a program, where the value of one variable depends on or is determined by the current value or state of another variable. In other words, a variable that is used to compute the final value for another is said to have data dependencies on that other variable, and the other is called a dependent variable or a downstream variable in this relationship, while the first is referred to as an upstream variable because it is an earlier variable used in computing the dependent value.

 
  1. What are some examples of data-dependent computations?
  2. How are these examples related to the concept of "time travel"?
  3. Can you provide a simple example of a time travel attack? How would you implement such an attack in Solidty?

I'm looking for a technical explanation of the concepts, not a philosophical discussion of morality. I'm particularly interested in understanding how data and time are related in smart contracts and how this affects the design of these systems.
Thank you!
