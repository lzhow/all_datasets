Reason: The variable `feeGrowthAbove0X128` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is calculated based on the `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` and `upper.feeGrowthOutside0X128`, which are derived from the parameters passed to the function and the state of the `Tick.Info` struct for the given `tickUpper`. On the other hand, the variable `liquidityNet` in the function `cross` is derived from the `Tick.Info` struct for a given `tick` and represents the net liquidity after a tick has been crossed.

There is no direct data dependency between `feeGrowthAbove0X128` and `liquidityNet` because they are related to different operations and are derived from different sources of data. `feeGrowthAbove0X128` is concerned with fee growth calculations, while `liquidityNet` is related to the net change in liquidity when a tick is crossed. They operate on different instances of the `Tick.Info` struct (associated with different tick indices) and do not influence each other's computation within the given context of the code.
