The contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `initialSupply` in the function `constructor`. This is because `initialSupply` is used as an argument in the `_mint` function call within the constructor of the `n00dToken` contract. The `_mint` function internally updates the `_balances` mapping to reflect the minted tokens for the `msg.sender` address. The amount of tokens minted and assigned to `msg.sender` in the `_balances` mapping is equal to the value of `initialSupply`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `_balances` and `initialSupply`.
