Reason: The contract state `buyNftFeeJay` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyERC1155` because the value of `buyNftFeeJay` is recalculated and potentially updated in the `updateFees` function based on the ETH to JAY conversion rate, which is influenced by the contract's balance and total supply. The `amounts` variable in `buyERC1155` represents the number of NFTs being transferred, and when these NFTs are bought using ETH, the contract's balance increases, which in turn can affect the conversion rate used in the `ETHtoJAY` function. Since `buyNftFeeJay` is updated to the result of `ETHtoJAY(buyNftFeeEth)` within `updateFees`, there is an indirect data dependency relationship between `buyNftFeeJay` and `amounts` through the contract's balance and the `ETHtoJAY` conversion rate.
