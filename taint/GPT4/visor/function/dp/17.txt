Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `sendValue`, the variable `success` is set as a result of the `recipient.call{ value: amount }("")` operation. This operation attempts to send the specified `amount` of Ether to the `recipient`. The success of this operation, and thus the value of the `success` variable, directly depends on whether the `amount` can be successfully sent to the `recipient`. If the `amount` is not successfully sent, `success` will be `false`; if it is successfully sent, `success` will be `true`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `success` and `amount` because the value of `success` is determined by the execution outcome of the operation that includes `amount`.
