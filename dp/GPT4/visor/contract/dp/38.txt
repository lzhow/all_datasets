yes

In the `functionDelegateCall` function within the provided Solidity code, the variable `success` is directly dependent on the variable `target`. The `success` variable is assigned the result of the `delegatecall` function, which is invoked on the `target` address with the `data` parameter. The `delegatecall` is a low-level call that executes the code at the `target` address within the context of the calling contract. The outcome of this call (success or failure) is determined by the code executed at the `target` address, which makes `success` data dependent on `target`.
