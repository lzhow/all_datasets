Reason: The variable `interestAccumulated` in the function `accrueInterest` is calculated within that function based on the current state of the contract, specifically using the variables `borrowsPrior`, `simpleInterestFactor`, and the result of the `mulScalarTruncate` function. It does not rely on any input from the `liquidateBorrowFresh` function.

On the other hand, the variable `actualRepayAmount` in the function `liquidateBorrowFresh` is determined by the `repayBorrowFresh` function call, which is based on the parameters passed to `liquidateBorrowFresh` (such as `liquidator`, `borrower`, and `repayAmount`) and the current state of the contract at the time of the liquidation.

There is no direct data dependency between `interestAccumulated` and `actualRepayAmount` as they are calculated independently within their respective functions and do not share state or influence each other's computation within the given code snippet.
