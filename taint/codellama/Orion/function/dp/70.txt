  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `function` ` getY`, the variables `x` and `j` are used to calculate the value of `c`. The variable`xp` is used in a loop to iterate over the elements of the array ` x` to get the sum of all the values in `X`.
On the other hand, in function`get_Amount_In`, variable x is not used.
Therefore, the data in variable  ` XP` depends on variable i in` get Amounts_in`.
