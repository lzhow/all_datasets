In the `safeIncrementAllowence` function, the value of `newAllownce` is calculated by adding the current allownace of the token to the amount of value. This value is then passed to `approval` as the new allowence.
However, this function does not take any input from the outside world, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user input. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the input is user-controlled or not.
