The function calculateLiquidateBorrowAllowed in UniswapV2Pair.sol is a function that calculates the amount of collaterals that can be withdrawn by a user in exchange for a certain amount (or all) of liquidity tokens. This function takes into account the price of the collatorals, the total supply of LP tokens, and the balances of each user.

In the first line of code, we retrieve the address of price oracle from the contract. We then use the getAssetPrices function to retrieve a price for each of our two assets (in this case, WETH and DAI).
We then calculate the value of WBTC in USD, using the formula:
(Price of asset 1 in ETH) * (Number of units of Asset 2 in Asset1)
Then, in line 30 of Univ2pair.s, it calculates:  (Price oracle for WBT) / (price of Dai in usd)  and multiplies it by the balance of user 4.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "the address price Oracle from contract". Could you please explain what that means?
