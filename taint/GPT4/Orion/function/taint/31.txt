Explanation: The variable `amountB` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the input parameters `amountBDesired`, `amountBMin`, and the reserves of the tokens `tokenA` and `tokenB`. The user can only provide the desired amount and minimum amount, but the actual value of `amountB` is determined by the contract logic.
