   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on. I also want to do this for a living. Any suggestions? Please be very specific. Thank you.  I know this is probably not the best place to ask this question, but I have tried other forums and cannot find anything helpful. If you could please direct me to a better resource I would appreciate it.   I want you to reply with a bulleted list of 10 specific things I should do to become proficient in Python. Each item should be a link to an online tutorial or a book. Try to find something that has a lot of examples and exercises. Also, try to avoid courses that teach you the "wrong" way of doing things. Instead, focus on teaching you best practices. For example, instead of teaches you how a for loop works, teache you why it is bad and how it can be replaced with list comprehension. Finally, make sure to provide a ton of code examples. Most importantly
