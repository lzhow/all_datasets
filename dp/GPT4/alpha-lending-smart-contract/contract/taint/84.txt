Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `offset` within the function `decodeBytes65` is part of the `Data` struct which is passed as a memory argument to the function. The `Data` struct is initialized with user-provided input through the `from` function, which takes a `bytes memory data` parameter supplied by the user. Since the user controls the initial `raw` bytes data, they indirectly control the `offset` as it is used to traverse the user-supplied data. The `offset` is incremented based on the size of the data being decoded, which is determined by the user's input. Therefore, the `offset` variable is controlled by the user.
