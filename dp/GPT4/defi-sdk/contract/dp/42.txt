Yes

The variable `amount` in the function `depositEth` is data dependent on the variable `amountOut` in the function `getAmountsIn`. The reason for this is that `amountOut` is used to calculate the `amountsIn` array, which is then used in the `callBytes` function to determine the amount to be deposited when calling `depositEth`. The `amountsIn` array is computed based on the `amountOut` parameter, and the first element of this array (`amountsIn[0]`) is passed as the `amount` argument to `depositEth` when the input token is ETH. This establishes a direct data dependency between `amountOut` and the `amount` used in `depositEth`.
