  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `position` function, the variables `int8 wordpos` and `uint  bitpos ` are calculated based on ` tick` . The ` fliptick` method uses the result of the` position`function to calculate the value of ` word pos`and ` bit pos`. Therefore, `bitpos`, which is calculated in ` position`, is data-dependent on` tick`.
Similarly,` word Pos` is also data - dependent on tick because it is used to index the mapping in` f lipticks`.
