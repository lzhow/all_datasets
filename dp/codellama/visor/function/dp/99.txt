  
The label is 'No'.

In the `trySub` function, the value of `b` is compared to the current value stored in ` a`. The value in  ` b` does not change during the execution of the contract, so it is not dependent on any other variable.
On the other hand, in function add, ` c` stores the result of adding `  a` and `   b`. However, this value is only used to check if the addition operation overflows. It is never used as an input to any function or stored as a variable, making it independent of any variable in other functions. Therefore, there is no data dependence between ` ` and  .
