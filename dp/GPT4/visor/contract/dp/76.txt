Reason: The variable `errorMessage` in the function `sub` with the signature `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b, string memory errorMessage)` is not data dependent on the variable `a`. The `errorMessage` is a string that is passed into the function and used only in the `require` statement to provide a custom error message in case the condition `b <= a` is not met. It does not depend on the value of `a` or any computation involving `a`. The value of `errorMessage` is independent of the value of `a`; it is simply a message provided for error handling purposes.
