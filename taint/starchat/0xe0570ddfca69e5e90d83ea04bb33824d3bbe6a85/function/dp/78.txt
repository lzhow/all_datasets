The contract has a function called withdraw that takes in a uint called _share. It then calculates the amount of want that should be withdrawn based on how much of the total supply is being withdraw.

It does this by dividing the balance of all the shares (total supply) by the number of shares being withdrew (the _ shares parameter) and multiplying that by all of balance. This gives us the equivalent amount in want. 

Then it uses the _ burn function to reduce the sender's balance by _ share. Then it calculates how many tokens the strategy contract (which is an external contract) has in its balance, and stores that in b (variable b).
If b is less than r, it means that the withdraw function in strategy has withdraw more than it should have, so it calls withdraw on strategy with the difference between b and r ( _ withdraw). Then, after withdrawing, the want contract is checked again, this time in variable _ after.  The difference of _ _ and b, which is _ diff, is then checked. If _  _ is smaller than _, then r is set to b plus _.
Finally, want is transferred to the msg. sender, with an amount equal to r
