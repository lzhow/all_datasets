  
The variable 'pool' in function 'burnAltoken' is labeled as 'No'.

This is because the 'Pool' variable is defined as a storage variable in Solidiy, which means that it persists between function calls. Therefore, the value of 'pools' cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it would be a state variable.
