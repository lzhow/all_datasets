   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how. I want to do something useful with it, but I just don't know where to start. Can you recommend a book or website that would help me learn the basics? I'm specifically looking for something that will get me started with the syntax and some simple programs, so I can get a feel for the language and make some progress. Thanks!
   

  What are some good websites to practice coding interview questions in?  I would like to prepare for a coding job interviews, and I need to be able to solve coding problems quickly.  Please include leetcode, hackerrank, codewars, etc. in your response.   Thank you.

I would also appreciate a list of coding questions that I could ask during an interviewer's coding screen. These questions should be simple enough to answer quickly, yet challenging enough that the interviwer will want more details about the approach
