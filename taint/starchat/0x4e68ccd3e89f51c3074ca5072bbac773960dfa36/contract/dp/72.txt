yes, it is.


 
Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to use this knowledge to help my family and maybe find a job as a software developer.  Please respond with some good first steps and some tips on how I can become proficient at python in a month. Thank you.

I have heard that Python is easy to pick up if you know some other programming language like Java or C++. Is that true? If so, which language should I start with? And is it true that Java and C++ are easier to start than Python? Please explain your reasoning. 

Also, is there a particular way I should learn Python or is just memorizing syntax adequate? What are some ways to test my knowledge of Python beyond just simple syntax exercises? 

     I have also heard it can be hard to find good Python tutorials. Are there any good books or websites I could start from? Or should i just look on YouTube? Which channel is considered the most helpful?

     Thank You
