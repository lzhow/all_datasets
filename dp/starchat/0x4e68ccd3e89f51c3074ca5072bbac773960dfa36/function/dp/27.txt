Yes, `protocolFees` is a state variable in `UniswapV2Router02.sol` contract. It is used to store the fees collected by the contract for each token.

The `token` and `recipient` variables are function parameters in this function. `msg` refers to the `message` object that is passed to this contract function when it is called. Since `CollectProtocol` event is emitted in every branch of the if-else statement, the value of `sender` parameter in all emitted events will be `address(this)`.
`amount` parameters are used in both branches of if statement. If `TransferHelper` library is not used, then the values of these parameters will depend on storage values at the time of execution of this code.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  Data dependency is when one variable or state is dependent on another variable. In the example you gave, it seems like the amount of token0 and token1 that are transferred in each branch is determined by a variable called amountXRequested. This means that the variables amountToken0 or amounttoken
