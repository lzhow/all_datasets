The variable `_omega` in the function `setParams` is not data dependent on the variable `_numeraire` in the function `includeAsset`. 

Reason: The variable `_omega` is calculated based on the values stored in the `curve` storage variable, which is not modified or accessed in the `includeAsset` function. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `_omega` and `_numeraire`.
