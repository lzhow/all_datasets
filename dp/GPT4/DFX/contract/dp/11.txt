Yes, the variable `amount_` in the function `viewRawAmountLPRatio` is data dependent on the variable `_quoteWeight` in the same function. 

Explanation: The function `viewRawAmountLPRatio` takes `_quoteWeight` as one of its parameters and uses it in the function call `IAssimilator(_assim).viewRawAmountLPRatio(_baseWeight, _quoteWeight, address(this), _amount)`. The return value of this function call is assigned to the variable `amount_`. Therefore, the value of `amount_` depends on the value of `_quoteWeight`.
