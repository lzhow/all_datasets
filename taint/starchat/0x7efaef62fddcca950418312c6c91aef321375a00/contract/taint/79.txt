  What is an example of a variable that would be considered user-controlled?

User-generated content is content that was created or curated by individuals, rather than being generated by computers or algorithms. Examples of user content include social media posts, blog posts and comments, images, videos, and other digital content. User-created content can be created and managed by people in many different ways, including using a personal computer, a mobile phone, or a tablet.
In some cases, user generated content may be generated using algorithms or automated tools, such as bots or AI-powered software. In other cases it may simply be a matter of opinion or preference. For example, people may create content to share their thoughts, ideas, experiences, etc. However, the key distinction is that user created content does not originate from a computer or algorithm, whereas content created by AI or bots is considered "machine generated".
