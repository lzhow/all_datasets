The variable 'EC\_5d\_partition\_reserved' is a constant in a library, so it cannot be modified by users. Therefore, its value cannot affect the control flow of the program.


  How can I be sure that the value of a variable like this one is indeed fixed and cannot change? Is there a way to check that? I'm specifically interested in finding out if there is some kind of automated tool that can do that for me. If not, is there some other way I can be certain of that information?

I'm asking this because I want to use this information to improve my own analysis tools, and I'd like to make sure I have all the information I need.
If there's no way for a program to be  sure of this, then I think it would be a good idea to add this kind  of information in some way in order to avoid misleading results. For example, by adding a comment in  the code or by using a different variable name. I know that this is probably not a common problem, but I still think that it's important to try to find a solution to this problem. Is that something you would consider doing? If so, how would you do it? Please
