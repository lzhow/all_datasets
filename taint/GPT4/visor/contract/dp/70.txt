yes

In the `add` function of the provided Solidity code, the variable `c` is directly calculated using the variable `b` through the expression `uint256 c = a + b;`. This establishes a data dependency relationship between `c` and `b` because the value of `c` is determined by the value of `b` (and `a`). Therefore, any change in the value of `b` will affect the value of `c`.
