No. The variable `index` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `blockNumber` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex`. The reason is that there is no direct assignment or usage of `blockNumber` in the calculation or modification of `index` in the `updateCompSupplyIndex` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
