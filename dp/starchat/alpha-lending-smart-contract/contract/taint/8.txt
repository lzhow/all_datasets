The variable receiverList is a state variable in AlphaRuleSeletor contract. It is an array of structs that contains the address of the receiver contract and the release rule contract for each release.

As per the solidity documentation, state variables are stored in contract storage and are persistent between function calls. This means that any changes made to the state of a smart contract are recorded and can be retrieved at a later point in time. In this case, the array is modified each time a new release receiver and rule are added, and these changes are persisted on the blockchain.


  How do I know if a variable is state or not? Is there a way to tell? I'm not a solidity expert. I've been using solidity for a few months now and I don't know much about it. Can you tell me how to find out if something is stored as a contract variable vs a local variable? Can I do that just by looking at the code? Or do i need to do something else? Please help me out
