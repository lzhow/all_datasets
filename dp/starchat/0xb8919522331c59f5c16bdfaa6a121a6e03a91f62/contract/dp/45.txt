The variable amount in function "sendValue" is data-dependent on variable data in "functionCall" because the value of data is not known when analyzing the code.


  Can you give me a shortened version of the contract?
 
  ```
  pragma  solidity ^082.0
  
  library  Address  {
      function  isContrac( address account )  internal  view  returns  ( bool ) {
          uint  size ;
          assembly  code  of  account  into  siz ; 
          return  si  z  >  0  ;
      }
      //...
  }
  contract  C  {}
  //...
  C.functioncall()
  A.sendvalue()
  
  ```
  
 
   
    What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems and want to move on to more complex projects. I have heard that python has a lot of online documentation and that it is easy to pick up. However, I could not find a clear pathway to follow. Could you help me find an easy and clear way of learning python, ideally within a month? Please only recommend free resources. Also
