  
No, the variables `compToken ` and ` i` are independent.

In the `updateCompborowIndex` function, ` ctoken` is a parameter that is passed to it. It is used to access the state of the c token and update its borrow index.  The `ctoken` variable is local to this function and is only used within this context. Therefore, it is independent of any other variables.   The variable  `I` on  the other hand is defined in a different function. In the `_ setcompSpees`function,  it represents the index of a c Token in an array of c Tokens that are passed as a  parameter to  this  function . It  is also local  to that function  and  only  used  within  that context . Therefore , it  also  independent  of  any  other  variables .
