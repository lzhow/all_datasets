In the Solidity contract provided, the contract state `reserve1` is data dependent on the variable `balance1` in the function `swap`. The reason for this is that within the `swap` function, `balance1` is calculated based on the current balance of `token1` in the contract and the amount being transferred out (`amount1Out`). After potential external calls and additional logic, `balance1` is used in the `_update` function call to potentially change the state of `reserve1`. The `_update` function takes `balance0` and `balance1` as arguments and assigns them to `reserve0` and `reserve1` respectively, after performing some checks and calculations. This means that the value of `balance1` directly influences the value that `reserve1` will be updated to, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
