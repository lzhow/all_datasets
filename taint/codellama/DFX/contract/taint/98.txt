  
The variable error message in function callWithvalue is a string type variable. It is passed as an argument to the internal function. Therefore, the errormessage is user-controlled.

In the solidty code, we can see that the `functionCallwithValue` function takes in a `string` type `errormessage` as a parameter. This means that `ErrorMessage ` is an input parameter to this function, which means the value of `Errormessag` is set by a user or a caller of this method.  Therefore the answer is yes.
