Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `data` in the function `functionDelegateCall` is passed as an argument to the function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. Without further context or information about how the variable `data` is obtained or modified before being passed to `functionDelegateCall`, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label is unknown.
