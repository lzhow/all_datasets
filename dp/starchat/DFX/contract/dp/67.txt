The variable "a" in function "_efficienthash" is not used in "multiProofverify" function. Hence, it is safe to say that the variables "proof" and "leaves" are dependent on "root" variable.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "The variables 'proof'and 'leaves' are depenedent on 'root' variable." Could you please explain further?
 
  The variables `proof` and `leaves` are used as inputs to the `multiproofVerify` function, and the output of the `_hashpair`function is used to compute the next input to `_haspair`. This process continues until the final output is equal to `root`.
