The contract state `nftsSold` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155`. This is because the `amounts` variable represents the quantity of each ERC1155 token that is being bought, and this quantity directly affects the total number of NFTs sold, which is tracked by the `nftsSold` state variable.

In the `buyJayWithERC1155` function, we see that the `amount` variable is calculated by summing up all the `amounts[id]` within the loop:

```solidity
function buyJayWithERC1155(
    address[] calldata _tokenAddress,
    uint256[] calldata ids,
    uint256[] calldata amounts
) internal returns (uint256) {
    uint256 amount = 0;
    for (uint256 id = 0; id < ids.length; id++) {
        amount = amount.add(amounts[id]);
        // ... other code ...
    }
    return amount;
}
```

This `amount` is then returned to the calling function `buyJay`, where it is added to the `total` variable:

```solidity
function buyJay(
    // ... parameters ...
) public payable {
    // ... other code ...
    if (erc1155TokenAddress.length != 0)
        total = total.add(
            buyJayWithERC1155(
                erc1155TokenAddress,
                erc1155Ids,
                erc1155Amounts
            )
        );
    // ... other code ...
    nftsSold += total;
    // ... other code ...
}
```

Finally, the `nftsSold` state variable is incremented by the `total`, which now includes the `amount` returned from `buyJayWithERC1155`, thus establishing a data dependency relationship between `nftsSold` and the `amounts` variable.
