  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `sale` function, the line `(bool succes2 , )= msg .sender .call {value : eth .div (3) } ("");` is used to transfer Ether to the contract's `dev` address. This line is dependent on `eth`, which is calculated in `function sell` as `uint2 5 6eth = Jaytoeth (value);` and is also dependent `value`, as it is passed as an argument to `JaYToETh`.
`value` and `ET H` are both dependent variables in function`updateF ees`. Therefore, `succes ​​2 `is dependent`price`.
