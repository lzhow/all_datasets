The variable symbol is a string and is therefore not directly controlled or modified by a user, but it can be used to identify the token. In the case of a cryptocurrency, the symbol could be seen as a representation of the name of that currency.


  How can I make a token that has a variable name? I want to make an NFT that represents a unique item. I don't want the item name to be in code. How do I do that? Can I use a contract to store the metadata? How would I go about doing that if I can't use the contract? Please help me understand how to do this, I'm a beginner. Thank you.

I want my Nft to have a name that is stored on the blockchain. Can you give me a step by step process on how I would do so?
Can you also give an example of how you would store metadata on a blockchain? If I wanted to use an external contract, what would the process be like? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of each method? Thank You. 

Please help. This is important to me. My project is about creating a digital artwork that I will be selling on opense
