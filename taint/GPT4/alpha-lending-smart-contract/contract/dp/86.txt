Label: no

Reason: The contract state `CLOSE_FACTOR` is not present in the provided code snippet, and there is no indication that it is being used or modified within the `calculateCollateralAmountExternal` function. The function `calculateCollateralAmountExternal` takes `_token`, `_liquidateAmount`, and `_collateral` as parameters, but there is no reference to `CLOSE_FACTOR` or any computation that suggests a data dependency relationship with `_token`. Without additional context or code that defines and uses `CLOSE_FACTOR`, we cannot establish a data dependency relationship between `CLOSE_FACTOR` and `_token`. Therefore, the label is 'no'.
