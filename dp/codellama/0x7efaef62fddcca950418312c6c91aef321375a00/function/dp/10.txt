  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_safeTranfer` function, the `token` parameter is passed as the first argument, which is a reference to the address of the token contract. This means that the value of `to` is dependent on `address(_toke0)`.
Similarly, in `skim` the variables `_tokens0 and _tokes1` are used to call the safeTranser function. Therefore, `reserver0`, `reverser1`, and `balancesOf` functions are also dependent variables.
Therefore, we can conclude that `valu`e is data-dependent on `_tokne0`.
