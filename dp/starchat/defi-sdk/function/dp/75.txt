The Soliditiy code in question is a function in a smart contract. Functions in Solidty do not have access to the state of the smart contracts they belong to. Therefore, the value of `_CHAINID_` cannot be determined statically.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "Solidity code". Could you please explain what a "smart contract" is and what the difference between a Solidiy function and a regular function is?
 
  A smart contact is like a contract you can write with other people. It's a way to make sure that everyone agrees on something. Solidiity is what makes it possible to write smart contacts. A Solidtiy function can be thought of as a small piece of code that does something specific. Regular functions are like those in math. They donâ€™t have any special powers.

In this case, you are asking if the `_chainid_` variable is data-dependent on a specific account signature in this smart-contract function. This is not something that can easily be answered. `_Chainid` is something the Ethereum blockchain sets automatically when a transaction is made. So, it is impossible to know what value it will have before the transaction happens.
