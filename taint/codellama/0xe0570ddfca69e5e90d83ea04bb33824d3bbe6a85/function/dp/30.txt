  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_burn` function is called with the argument `_sender`, which is a parameter of the `msg` object. This means that the value of `_send` is dependent on `sender`.
Similarly, in function 2, `_diff` and `_after` are dependent variables of `b`. Therefore, `r` depends on `_before` which depends `want(). balanceOf (address (this))`.
