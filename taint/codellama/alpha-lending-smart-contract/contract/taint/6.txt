  
The variable _ token in give alpha to AlToken function is labeled as 'No'. The reason is that the _Token variable is passed as an argument to the give Alpha to alToken method. This means that it can be controlled only by a user who calls the method, and it cannot be changed by any other user or external contract.

In general, when a variable or state in a smart contract is used as a parameter in an external function, the value of that variable cannot change during the execution of the external call. Therefore, in this case, we can conclude that _ Token is a controlled variable.
