Label: no

Reason: The variable `cardinality` is used to determine the bounds of the search (specifically, it is used in the calculation of `l` and `r`, and to ensure the index wraps around within the bounds of the array `self`). However, `cardinality` itself is not modified based on the contents or state of the `self` array. It is passed as an argument to the function and used as a constant within the context of this function to control the loop and index calculations. There is no code that changes `cardinality` based on the data within `self`, nor is there any code that changes `self` based on `cardinality`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `cardinality` and `self`.
