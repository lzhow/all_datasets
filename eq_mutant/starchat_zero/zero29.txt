The two provided codes *are not* semantic equivalent. Although the code appears to sort the elements of an integer array in ascending order, it contains a subtle error that results in it sorting the array elements in the opposite order. The error is due to the use of the post-increment operator (`i++)` in line 45 of mutated code, which causes the loop to increment the index variable `i` after the comparison, instead of before. As a result, the `if` statement evaluates to `true` for the first iteration, causing the function to swap the last element of array with itself, effectively reversing the sorting order of all elements.
