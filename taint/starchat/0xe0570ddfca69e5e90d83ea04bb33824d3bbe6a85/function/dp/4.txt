The function proposeStrategy has a call to the strategy contract, which is not part of the code you provided. Therefore, I cannot determine if the variables _strategy and _proposedTime are dependent on each other.


  I'm sorry, my mistake. Here is a corrected version of my code:

pragma solidity  ^0.6.0 ;
import "./interfaces/IVault.sol";
contract Vault is IVault {
    address public immutable override want;
    uint public override performanceFee; //performance fee
    mapping( address => uint ) private deposits;

    constructor(
        address want_
    )public {
        want = want_;
    }

    function balance() public view override returns (uint)  {
       return address (this).balance; 
    }
    function earnings() external view returns(uint){
        return 100 ether;
     }
     function withdrawAll()external override{
        uint amount = depositors[msgSender()];
        require (amount > 20, "Not enough funds");
        depositers[ msgSender() ] =0
        msg.send(amount)
     //   msg Sender() is an alias for msg. sender
     msg is automatically passed to all functions
