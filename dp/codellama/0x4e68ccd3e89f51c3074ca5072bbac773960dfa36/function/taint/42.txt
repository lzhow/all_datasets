  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `safeTransffer` function is a library function that is imported from the external library `TranserHelper`. The `transfser` method is called on the token contract using the ABI encoding of the method selector and the arguments.
  The variable success is declared as a local variable in this function and is assigned the return value of a call to the contract's `call`method. This call is made with the encoded method and arguments, and returns a tuple of two values: a boolean indicating whether the call was successful, as well as the data returned bythe call.  In this case, `data` is returned as an empty byte array, which is then decoded to a bool value. Therefore, success variable is set to true if and only if both the success and data conditions are met. However, since the value is determined by a contract call,  it cannot be controlled directly by user input. Hence, this variable cannot  be considered as controlled  by  the  user and its label should be 'NO'.
