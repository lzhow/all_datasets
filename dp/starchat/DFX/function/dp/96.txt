  What does it mean for a variable to be data dependendent?
 
  A variable is said to have data dependencies if it is used in a way that depends on its value. For example, if a function f takes two inputs a and b, and the value of a is always 5, then the output of f will always be 2*5 =10. In this case, the input b is dependent on a, because the result of the operation depends solely on how a was defined.

In contrast, a constant is not dependent upon any other variables, so it does not have any data depending on it. A constant can be thought of as a value that is set once and cannot be changed. 

It is important to note that data depends does NOT mean that the data is stored in memory. Data depends means that a calculation or operation is performed based on that value, which means the calculation is done based off of that variable. This is different from how constants are defined, where the constant value is simply stored and does no calculations.


Does this help explain what data depdenency
