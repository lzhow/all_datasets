No, the variable `_factory` in the function constructor is not data dependent on the variable `amountBDesired` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange`. 

Explanation: The variable `_factory` is assigned a value in the constructor and its value does not change throughout the execution of the contract. On the other hand, the variable `amountBDesired` is a parameter of the `addLiquidityFromExchange` function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. There is no direct or indirect assignment or usage of `amountBDesired` in the constructor that would create a data dependency between these two variables. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
