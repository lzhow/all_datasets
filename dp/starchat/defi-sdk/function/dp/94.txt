The contract variable `_hashed_version` is not directly accessed by the `function hash`. However, it is possible that the `_hash_value` variable is modified by a function called by `Function hash`, which could potentially modify the value of `_hashe_verison`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  Data dependency is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value depends on another. In the context of smart contracts, data dependencies describe the flow of data between different parts of the code. For example, if a variable depends upon another variable, then the first variable will be updated whenever the second variable changes. This can lead to unintended consequences if the two are updated in different places in your code, which can cause bugs and security vulnerabilities.

In the example you provided, the data dependence relationship between the variables `fee` and `_HASHE_VERION` could be determined by analyzing the entirety of your smart contract. By examining the functions that are called and the values that they modify, you could determine whether or not the relationship exists.
