Explanation: The variable `amountOut` in the function `getAmountOutUv2` is data dependent on the variable `amountInWithFee` in the same function. This is because the value of `amountOut` is calculated using the value of `amountInWithFee` in the expression `amountOut = numerator / denominator`, where `numerator` and `denominator` are dependent on `amountInWithFee`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `amountOut` and `amountInWithFee`.
