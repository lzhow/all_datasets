  
The variable 'absoluteTokanAmount' in function 'hash' is a local variable and is created within the scope of the 'Hash' function. It is therefore not directly controlled or manipulated by any user input. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In general, any variable that is declared within a function and not passed as an argument is considered a 'local variable' or 'function-scoped variable'. These variables are created and destroyed each time the code enters and exits the block of code where they are declared. They are not accessible outside of this block and are therefore considered to be controlled and manipulable only within this scope.
