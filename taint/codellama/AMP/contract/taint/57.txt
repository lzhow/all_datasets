  
No, the ` lastvalue` variable in function `_removeTockenFromParition` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is assigned a value from the `_partionsOf` array, which is a mapping that stores the partitions of the token holders.

The `_partition` parameter is passed as an argument to the  function, and it can be controlled directly by a user, but the value of ` _lastvalue ` is determined by other factors, such as the length of `_ partitionsof` and the order of elements in that array. Therefore, `Lastvalue is considered to be under the control of a third party, not the end user directly.
