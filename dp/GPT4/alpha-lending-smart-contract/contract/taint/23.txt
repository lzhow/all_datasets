Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_optimalUtilizationRate` in the constructor function of the `PoolConfiguration` contract is set by the parameters passed to the constructor when the contract is deployed. These parameters are provided by the user who deploys the contract, which means that the initial value of `_optimalUtilizationRate` is indeed controlled by the user. After deployment, the value of `_optimalUtilizationRate` can only be changed if there is a function within the contract that allows for its modification, and such a function would typically be restricted to the contract owner or through a governance mechanism. However, based on the provided code snippet, the initial setting of `_optimalUtilizationRate` is user-controlled.
