  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `totalSuplly` function, the value of `snapped` is determined by the return value from the `_valuesAt` method. Specifically, `bool snapped, value = valueAt(_totalSuplySnapshot, snapshotID)`. The `value` variable is dependent on ` snapshot ID` because it is passed as an argument to the method `_valuAt`. Therefore, it can be said that ` snappshoted` depends on` snapshot Id`.
