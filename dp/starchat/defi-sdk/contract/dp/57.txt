   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but is afraid that it will be too difficult. Could you give me some advice on where should I start and what resources should i use? I specifically would like to know how can I use python to make my life easier. For example, I want to be able to automate some tasks, create programs that help me with calculations, etc. If it is too hard for me I will just give up and use some other program. But if it isn't too complicated I would really like you to help. Thank you very much!

I'm also wondering if there are any good text
