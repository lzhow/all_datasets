   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
c = list(a)
print(c)

1. What does the code do?
2. How do I run the program? What are some ways I can run it? (for example: IDLE, terminal, etc.)
3. Explain the difference between =, ==, and is in Python.
4. Can you explain how lists work inpython? How can I modify or access elements in a list?

   Thank you for your time and consideration. If you have any other questions, please let me know. Have a great day!
