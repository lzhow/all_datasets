Label: no

Reason: The variable `_TOKENS_RECIPIENT_INTERFACE_HASH` is a private constant of type `bytes32` within the `ERC777` contract. It is assigned a value at compile-time with the result of the `keccak256` hash function applied to the string literal `"ERC777TokensRecipient"`. Since this value is computed at compile-time and cannot be changed at runtime, it is not controlled by the user. It is an internal implementation detail of the contract that defines a specific interface hash used for ERC1820 registry interactions and is not subject to external modification.
