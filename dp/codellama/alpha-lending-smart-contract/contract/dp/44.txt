The contract variable _ balances is not dependent on _ amount in function Burn.  The function only modifies the _ balance of the account that is passed as a parameter, and it does not use the value of _ _Amount. Therefore, the data in _Balances does change when the burn function runs, but it is independent of any particular value in variable.
