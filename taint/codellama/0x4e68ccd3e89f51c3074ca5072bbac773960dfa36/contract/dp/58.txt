  
No.

The variable delta is not dependent on index in function 'get surrounding observations'. The variable 'delta' is calculated by subtracting the block timestamp of the last observation from the current block time. This calculation is performed in a private function called 'transform' which is called in 'write' function.  The 'index' variable is used to access the observation array in this function, but it is never used in calculating the ' delta' value. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.
