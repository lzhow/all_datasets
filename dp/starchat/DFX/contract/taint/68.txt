The variable b in function `mod` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of b is derived from user-controlled input a. If a is user controlled, then b must also be user controllable.


  How can I check if a variable is controll by a user?
  
  You can check whether a given variable or expression is directly controlled or derived by an external user by analyzing the control flow graph of the program. This can be done by constructing a control-flow graph (CFG) of your program, which is a graph representation of all possible execution paths through the code.

  To construct a CFG, you can use a tool like the one provided by Microsoft in their Visual Studio Code extension Soliditity. Once you have a basic understanding of how control flows through your code, and have identified the relevant variables, expressions, or statements, determining whether they are controlled can become much easier.

To determine whether an expression or variable in your Solidty program is controlable by external users, follow these steps:
