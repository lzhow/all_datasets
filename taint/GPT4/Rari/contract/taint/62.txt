No, the variable `oldPendingAdmin` in the function `_setPendingAdmin` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `oldPendingAdmin` is assigned to the `pendingAdmin` variable, which is set by the contract itself in the `_setPendingAdmin` function. The value of `oldPendingAdmin` is not influenced or controlled by any user input.
