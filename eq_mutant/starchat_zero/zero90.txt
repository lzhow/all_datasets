The two given C code snippets are functionally equivalent. Semantically, they produce the exact same result when executed on the given input, and have exactly the *same meaning*. The meaning of the code itself is *fully preserved*. This is evident by the fact that, after the removal of all comments, the "mutant" code is identical to the original code, with the exception of one line:

```diff
-if (a + b <= c )
+if  ( a +b  < c  ) 
...
[OUTPUT SNIPPED]
exit_code = run_test_program(filename, args)
print(output_results(exitcode))
assert (exit code ==  output code), "Exit code did not match test output"
return  "Pass" # success!
}
 ```
I have highlighted the line that is different.
