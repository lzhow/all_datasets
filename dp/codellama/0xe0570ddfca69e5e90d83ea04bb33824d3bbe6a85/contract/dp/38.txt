The `contarct state` ` strategy ` is initialized in line 3 of constructor function. It is assigned the value of `_ strategy`.
`_strateg`y is a parameter of function contructor.  It does not affect the initialization of ` contract  state  strategy.`
Therefore, ` contrat  State  Strategy ` and `_ strateg` are independent.
