  
No, the ` numerators` variable in function `_mintsFess` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the current state of the contract and the input parameters. It is a constant value that does not change based  on user input.

The `reserves` and `total supply` variables are also not user-controlled because they are calculated from the state variables of `PanaceaERc2O` contract.
