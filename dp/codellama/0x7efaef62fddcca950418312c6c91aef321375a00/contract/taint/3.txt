  
No, the ` to` variable in function `swap` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a function parameter.

The ` swap` function is called by a user who wants to swap a certain amount of tokens from one token to another. However, within the context of the smart contract, `  to ` is a variable that represents the address of a token that the swapped tokens will be sent to. This address is determined by other factors within  the contract and is therefore not under the control of  a  user .
