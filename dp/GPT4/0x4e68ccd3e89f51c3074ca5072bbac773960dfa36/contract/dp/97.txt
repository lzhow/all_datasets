Label: no

Reason: The variable `last` in the function `write` is used to store the last observation from the array of observations `self` at a given index. It is then used to check if the last observation's timestamp is equal to the current `blockTimestamp` and to calculate the new observation if the timestamps are different.

On the other hand, the variable `targetAtOrAfter` in the function `binarySearch` is a boolean that is determined by comparing timestamps within the binary search algorithm to find the correct observations surrounding a target timestamp.

There is no direct data flow or computational dependency between `last` and `targetAtOrAfter`. The variable `last` is derived from the state of the contract (the `self` array), while `targetAtOrAfter` is a local variable within the `binarySearch` function that is used to control the flow of the binary search algorithm. They operate independently within their respective functions and do not influence each other's values.
