The variable _**type**_ in function **constructor** is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the input to this variable is derived from user-controlled input and is used to set up the state of the contract. Therefore, while the value of _*type* is fixed, its value is determined by a user's input that is external to the smart contract, and therefore the _*_type_* variable can be considered to be controlled indirectly by that user through the *supportedFactory* mapping.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what you mean by "controlled indirect" by this context. Can I control the type variable? If so, how? Can the mapping be modified by me? What does the "user-controllable input" mean in this case? Is it the constructor parameters? Or is it something else? Please explain in detail. I am confused. Thanks.

Also, please provide a more detailed explanation of how to use the tool. What are the steps I can take to run the analysis and what are some examples of what the output might look like. For example, if I run it on the example code you provided, what does it output? How do I interpret
