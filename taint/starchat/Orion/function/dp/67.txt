The variable c in both functions is not dependent on each other. This is because the addition and multiplication operations in Soliditiy are associative and commutative, meaning that the order in which the operations are performed does not matter. Therefore, the value of c is always the same regardless of the specific order of addition or multiplication.


  Can you give me a short explanation of how the associativity and communitivity of arithmetic operations can be used to prove that a variable is independent of another?
 
  Sure! In mathematics, associativty and Commutativity are two important properties of operations that can help us to determine whether two or more operations commute or are related to eachother.

Associativity means that if we group operations of a certain kind in a way that doesnot change the result, then the grouping has no effect on its result. For example, if you add three numbers together, and you group them as (1+2)+3, you get the exact same result as if the numbers were added directly. In this case, we say that addition is associatively defined. 

Commutativitly means, that we can interchange the arguments of an operation without changing the resulting value. If
