In the given code, the `liquidateCalcualteSeizetokents` function is a public view function that takes in three parameters: `cTokenborrowed`, `ctokenCollatoral`, and `replayAmount`. The function returns two values: the first is an `uint` and the second is also an`uint`.
  The ` repaAmount ` variable is passed as an argument to the` liquidatCalculateseiztokens`function.
   The` repayaMount` variable can be controlledby the caller of thefunction, but it cannot be directly modified by any other function in this contract. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the value of ` replayamount` is user-controlled or not.
