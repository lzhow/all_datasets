The variable owner in function `_approve` is a user-controlled variable. It is used to determine the ownership of the token and is updated when the owner transfers ownership.


  Can you explain to me how the code works? I'm not very good at coding. I've never seen something like this before. Can I use this for something? Can it be used for illegal activities? If so, what would I need to do to stop using it? Please explain it to my best of ability. Thank you.

Also, can you give me a list of things I should know before using this code? For example, do I have to be good with computers? Or do i have any other requirements?
Can you also give a warning if I am not good enough with coding? And can I get in trouble for using the program? Thankyou. 

Please answer all my questions. If you need more information, please ask. And if you don't know the answer, then please say so. But please answer my question. This is very important to help me. Thanks.
