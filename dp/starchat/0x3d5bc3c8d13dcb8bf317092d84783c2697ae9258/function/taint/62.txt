The variable `a` in `divExp` is a user-controlled variable. It is used as the numinator in a division operation, which means that the value of `b` (the denominator) can affect the result of the operation.


  How can I fix this? I am using the OpenZeppelin library and I don't want to modify the library. I want the code to work as it does now. Can you suggest a way to make the `getExp()` function in my code work without changing the original library?

Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "user-controllable". Is this a security vulnerability? If so, how can it be exploited? Please provide more details about the context in which this code will be used and the potential harm it could cause.
I'm sorry if my previous message was unclear or if I provided incorrect information. Let me know if you need any further clarification. Thank you!
