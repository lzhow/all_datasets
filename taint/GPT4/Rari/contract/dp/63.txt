Label: no

Reason: The contract state `accountBorrows` is not explicitly mentioned in the provided Solidity code. Therefore, without additional context or code that defines and interacts with `accountBorrows`, it is not possible to establish a data dependency relationship between `accountBorrows` and the variable `implementation_` within the function `_setImplementationInternal`. The function `_setImplementationInternal` is concerned with updating the `implementation` address of the contract and does not appear to interact with any borrowing logic or state that could be associated with `accountBorrows`.
