Reason: The variable `supplier` in the function `distributeSupplierComp` is used to calculate the supplier's accrued rewards and update their state in the rewards distribution process. On the other hand, the variable `compRemaining` in the function `grantCompInternal` represents the remaining balance of the rewards token in the contract. The calculation of `compRemaining` does not depend on any specific supplier's information, and it is used to determine if there are enough tokens to transfer to a user.

The flow of data between these two variables does not exist as they operate independently within their respective functions. The `supplier` variable is used to track the rewards for a specific supplier, while `compRemaining` is a check on the contract's balance before performing a transfer. There is no direct data dependency relationship between `supplier` and `compRemaining` as they are used in separate contexts and for different purposes within the contract.
