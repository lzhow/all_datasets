Yes

The variable `value` in the function `safeDecreaseAllowance` is data dependent on the variable `token` because the `value` is used in a call to `token.allowance` to calculate the `newAllowance`. The `token.allowance` function call requires the `token` variable to interact with the ERC20 token contract to fetch the current allowance amount. This fetched allowance is then used in conjunction with the `value` variable to calculate `newAllowance` using the `SafeMath.sub` function. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `value` and `token` within the `safeDecreaseAllowance` function.
