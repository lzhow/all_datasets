The contract function 'buy_JAY_with_ERC_1_5_ 5' has a loop that iterates over the input arrays '_token_address', '_ids', and '_amount'. The loop body contains a call to the'safe_transfer_from' function of the I_E_R_C_ '1 1 _5  _' contract. This function transfers '_id' amount of tokens from '_msg. sender_' to 'address( this )'.

In the context of this function, the '_n_fts_sold_' contract variable is not directly involved in this loop. However, it is possible that the value of '_nft_sold_' could be changed by the call of 'transferFrom' in some cases.
Therefore, in general, we cannot determine whether the data dependence relationship between '_ n_ft_ sold_' and the loop variable 'amount' is 'Yes' or 'No'.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract and their types?
 
  Yes, here is a complete list and type of each variable in our example contract:
- nftsForSale: uint8
 - nftPrice: int
