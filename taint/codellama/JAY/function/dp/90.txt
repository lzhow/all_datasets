  
No, the variables ` er c7 2 3  Ids` and ` from` are independent.

The reason is that the `buyJ ay` function is a public function that is called by the user, and it takes in several parameters, including `er c 7  2  3   Id s` as an array of ERC-771 token IDs. These IDs are used to buy NFTs from the contract. On the other hand, ` on ER C 5 6  Received` is an external function called when an ER  C-1 9  token is received by this contract, which takes the address of the token contract as a parameter. This function does not use the parameter `fr om` at all. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
