  
No, the ` success` variable in function `buJJNoNFt` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be modified by any external user or function.

The `require` function is used to check if a condition is met, and if it isn' t, an exception is thrown. In this case, ` require (success)` is checking if `msg .value> MIn` and `start` are true. If either of these conditions is false, then an error is raised. However, since `sucess`is a variable that is defined within the scope of the`bujJnoNfT`function, any changes to it will not affect the state of other functions or variables. Therefore,`success `is not considered to be controlledby theuser.
