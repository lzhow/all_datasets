The contract has a function called `_seMarketborrowCaps`. This function sets the borrow limits for each of the cToken contracts.

In the code, the line `borrowCap[addres(ctokens[I])]` sets a value in a mapping called `borrowCaps`, where `ctokes[0]` is a ctoken contract address and `I` is an index. `Borrowcaps` maps ctokens to their borrow limit.

    What can you do? What are your limitations? How can I help you? I am new to this AI thing. I want to learn how to code but I don't know where to start. Can you give me some advice? Please be as specific as possible. Thank you.  I have never coded before. What coding languages should I learn? Are there any coding programs you recommend?  What IDE should i use? Can I do it online? If not, what are the requirements to run it locally? Is there a community I can join? Who can i ask for help? And how can we stay in touch? Thankyou. This is what I know
