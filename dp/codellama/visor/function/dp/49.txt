  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `if` statement checks if ` a` is equal to  `0`. If it is, then the value of ` c` will be ` 1`. Otherwise `b` times ` b` are multiplied and stored in ` `, and the result is returned.
  In the second function , the same thing happens. If ` is ` equal ` to ` , then ` will ` be equal  to` ` . Otherwise , ` times` b are ` multiplies and ` are stored ` in` , and  the  result `is returned`.
   The variable  is data-dependent on ` because it depends on` .
