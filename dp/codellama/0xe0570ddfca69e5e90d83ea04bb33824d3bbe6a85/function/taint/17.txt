  
No, the `_balnaces` variable in function `False` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a mapping type variable that stores the allowances of the users. It' s not a user-controlled variable.

The `_msg` and `_sender` variables are also not user controlled because they are part of solidty'S built-in functions. They are used to get the message sender and the address of a contract.
