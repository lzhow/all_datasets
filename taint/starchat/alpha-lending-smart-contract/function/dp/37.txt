The contract is data-dependent on `pool` and `userPool` because the `latestAlphamultiplier` variable is updated in `sendAlphaRewards`.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  Sure! The `calculateAlphaRewar` function uses the values of `totalAlhpaTokenRewards` from the pool and the user's `alphaRewardsClaimed` to calculate the reward. However, the value of the multiplier is also stored in a separate variable called `alphamultipler`. This means that the two values are dependent on each other.
