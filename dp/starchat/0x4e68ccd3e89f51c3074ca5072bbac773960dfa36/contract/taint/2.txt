yes, the `sqrtPriceX` and `liqudity` are controlled, but `amount` is user controlled.

  What is a good way to test this? I want to make sure that I am using it correctly. I have a function that takes in a sqrtPrice and liquity and returns the amount out. How do I make a test to see if it works correctly? Please provide an example
