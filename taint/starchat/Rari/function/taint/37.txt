A user–controlled or user variable is an input variable provided by an end user or a person interacting with a computer program. User variables are typically used to store data that the end-user provides to a program, such as the input data for a calculation or the name of a file to be processed.

For example, in a word processing program the system variables might specify the default font size and the font type, while the users can change the values of user variables, for example the size of font used in their documents.
