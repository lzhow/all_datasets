Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `amounts` in the function `buyERC1155` and the variable `startedAt` in the function `updateFees` do not have a direct data dependency relationship. The variable `amounts` is used to calculate the `amount` variable in the `buyERC1155` function, while the variable `startedAt` is used in the `updateFees` function to check a condition. There is no direct interaction or dependency between these two variables. Therefore, the data dependency between `amounts` and `startedAt` is unknown.
