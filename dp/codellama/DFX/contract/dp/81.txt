  
No, the variables `_o` and `_t` are local variables in `getOrigin` function and `originSwaps` functions, respectively. They are independent of the `curves` variable in any way.

The `Swappable` interface is defined in a separate contract, and it is not related to the data dependencies of `Curves`. Therefore, it does not affect the analysis of data dependence in this contract.
