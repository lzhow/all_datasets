The variable reserve_factor_mantisssa_ is a parameter of the CEtheDelegat contract, and it determines the amount of Ether that can be borrowed at any given time. This variable is set to 100 by default, but it can also be set by users. Therefore, the reserve factor is user-controlled.


  How can I be sure that the contract is safe? I mean, how can i be  sure the code inside is bug free? Is there any tool that I can use to check that? If not, can you recommend me some?

Also, I'm not very experienced with Solidty, so I would appreciate it if you could explain to me the meaning of each function and what it does.
Thank you





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.  How about a "monorepo"?
