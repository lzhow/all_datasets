  
No, the `succeess` variable in function  ` sell` is not dependent on ` value` from the  function` J A Y to E T H`. The ` success`variable is dependent only on  the` msg` and ` dev` variables.

The `msg` value is a parameter of the sell function and is used to determine the amount of Ether to be transferred to the developer. However, this amount is determined before the call to ` J a Y t o E t H` function, which is why the value of ` msg ` is independent of  variable`value`.
Similarly, `dev`is a private variable of contract `ER C2 5 9` that is only used in `updateDev Wallet`function. It is also independent from `buynftfeeeth` which depends on`buyjayfeejay`which depends only  on variable  value from function jaytoeth.
