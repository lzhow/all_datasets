    
  You are a call graph analyzer for programs. I will give you a program and you tell me its call graph. The output format is json file, including nodes and edges.


    Here's your input file: List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

numbers.forEach(n -> System.out.println(n));

    Here's your output:

   {
     "nodes": [
       {"id": "n0", "label": "numbers", "type": "local variable"},
       {"id": "n1", "label": "n", "type": "loop variable"},
       {"id": "n2", "label": "System.out.println", "type": "method"},
       {"id": "n3", "label": "n -> System.out.println(n)", "type": "lambda expression"}
     ],
     "edges": [
       {"from": "n0", "to": "n2"},
       {"from": "n1", "to": "n2"},
       {"from": "n2", "to": "n3"}
     ]
   }

Please pay attention to the following rules:
1. The input is a Java program.
2. The call graph should be represented as a json file including nodes and edges.
3. The nodes are Java statements and expressions. Their types are method, local variable, loop variable, or lambda expression.
4. The edges represent the call relationships between statements and expressions.
5. The output should be a valid json file.<|end|>

Here is the corrected version of the input program:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class CallGraph {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        numbers.forEach(n -> System.out.println(n));
    }
}
```<|end|>
<|user|>
Can you please provide the corrected output?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
Here is the corrected output:
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "n0", "label": "numbers", "type": "local variable"},
    {"id": "n1", "label": "n", "type": "loop variable"},
    {"id": "n2", "label": "System.out.println", "type": "method"},
    {"id": "n3", "label": "n -> System.out.println(n)", "type": "lambda expression"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"from": "n0", "to": "n2"},
    {"from": "n1", "to": "n2"},
    {"from": "n2", "to": "n3"}
  ]

What is the difference between a raspberry pi and an esp32? What is better suited for interfacing with a SD card?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer that runs a full-fledged operating system, while the ESP32 is a microcontroller that is typically used for IoT applications. The Raspberry Pi is better suited for interfacing with an SD card as it has a full-fledged operating system and a large number of libraries available for interfacing with various peripherals, including SD cards. The ESP32, on the other hand, is optimized for low-power consumption and limited memory, making it ideal for IoT applications that require low-cost hardware and minimal processing power.<|end|>
