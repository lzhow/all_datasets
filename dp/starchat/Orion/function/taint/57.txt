yes, the `decimal` variable in `curveDecimaltoBaseunit` is user controlled.

  What is a good way to test if a variable is under the control of the users?  Is there a way for me to do this myself? I am not very good at coding.  I would like to know if there is an easy way I can test this for myself. I have heard that there are some tools that can help me do that. Can you recommend some? If there aren't any, can you tell me how I could do it myself, and what the best way would be to verify that the decimal variable was indeed user-controlled? Please provide detailed instructions. Thank you.

I am asking you this because I want to make sure that I'm not missing anything important. If you can provide me with a simple way of testing this, that would help a lot. Thanks again. 

Also, if you could provide a list of all the variables in this code, along with whether or not they are user or program controlled, please do so. That would also be very helpful. Again, thank you for your help. This is very important to me. Let me know how else I may be able to assist you
