Reason: The contract state `_ROLLBACK_SLOT` is a constant bytes32 value that represents a specific storage slot in the contract. It is defined as `bytes32 private constant _ROLLBACK_SLOT = 0x4910fdfa16fed3260ed0e7147f7cc6da11a60208b5b9406d12a635614ffd9143;` and is not modified or dependent on any other variables or inputs throughout the contract.

The variable `_data` in the `constructor` of the `ERC1967Proxy` contract is used to pass data to the `_upgradeToAndCall` function, which in turn may call the `Address.functionDelegateCall` with the new implementation address and the provided `_data`. However, this does not create a data dependency relationship with `_ROLLBACK_SLOT` because `_ROLLBACK_SLOT` is a fixed storage location that is not influenced by the `_data` variable or by the operations performed in the constructor.

Therefore, `_ROLLBACK_SLOT` and `_data` do not have a data dependency relationship.
