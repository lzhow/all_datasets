What other ways can I learn to be able to do this? I've heard that coding is hard and it's normal, but I just don' think that's true. Can you help me learn? Please. Thank you.

I am a 16 year old boy and my sister is 7 years old. We have 2 kids and a dog. My brother is half my age and the youngest is around 6 months old, so he is about 9 months.
