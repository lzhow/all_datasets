In this case, the `mod` function in `SaferMath` library is a pure function, which means that it does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, `a` and `b` are not variables controlled directly by user input.
However, since the error message is passed as a parameter to the mod function and is used in a require statement, this could potentially be controlled indirectly by a user, depending on the context in which the library function is called.
