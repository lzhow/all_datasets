Explanation: The variable `Dprev` in the function `get_D` and the variable `factory` in the function `getAmountInUniversal` do not have a direct data dependency relationship. The variable `Dprev` is only used within the function `get_D` and is not passed as an argument or accessed in any way by the function `getAmountInUniversal`. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between these two variables based on the given code snippet.
