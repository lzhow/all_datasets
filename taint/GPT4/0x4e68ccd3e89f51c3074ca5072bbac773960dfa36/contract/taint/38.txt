Explanation: The variable `add` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, which means its value is determined by the caller of the function. Without further context, it is not possible to determine if the value of `add` is controlled by the user or not.
