  
No, the `CTokenn` variable in `flywheePreborowerAction` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a parameter of the  function.

The ` flyweelPre borower action` function is called by `comp` contract, and the parameter ` ctoken`is passed to it. Therefore, `ctoken` cannot be controlled directly by a user and is considered uncontrolled.
