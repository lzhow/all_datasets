  
The label for the answer is 'No'.

Explanation: The variable '_token' is a local variable in function 'skim' that is assigned the value of the 'token  ' variable, which is defined in a different scope. Therefore, the '_ token' variable is determined at compile time and is fixed at the time of deployment. It is therefore not under the control of any user input and can be considered as not being controlled.
