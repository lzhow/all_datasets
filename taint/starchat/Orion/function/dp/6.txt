The function is not compilable Solidiy code.


 
I'm sorry, I made a mistake in my previous response. Here is a corrected version of the code:

`function foo() public {
    uint x = bar();
    baz(x);
}
uint private bar() internal returns (uint) {}
void private baz() private {}`
 
  The function foo is data-dependent on x because x is assigned a value that is derived from a state that may change between the assignment and the use of x. This means that the value of a variable may depend on a previous value or state of another variable. In this case, the state may be changed by calling the bar function, which is marked as internal.
In the case of baz, it is also data dependendent on its own state because it calls a function marked private. However, in this example, this is because the private function can only be called from within the same contract, so the calling function must also be marked internal or public. If the call was instead to a public function then the data would not be dependent on this state.
  In general, data dependencies can be complex and difficult to determine, especially in more complex code invol
