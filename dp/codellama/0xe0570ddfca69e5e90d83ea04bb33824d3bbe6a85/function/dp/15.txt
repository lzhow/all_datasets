  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `function withdraw` of the given contract, the `_withDraw` variable is calculated using the balance of `msg` and `_share` variables.
`_withdrawn` is then used to calculate the amount of tokens to be transferred to the user.  The `_after` value is also calculated, which is used in a conditional statement to determine if the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance. If it is, then the difference between the two is subtracted from the total supply. This means that the value of `_totalsupply`, which represents the remaining supply of a token, is dependent on `_Shares`.
Therefore, we can conclude that `_TotalSuppply` has a dependency on _Share.
