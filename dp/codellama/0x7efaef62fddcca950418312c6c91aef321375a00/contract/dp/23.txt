  
No, the ` data` variable in function `_safe Transfer` is not dependent on variable` _ token  ` in ` skimming` function.

The reason is that the `_ safeTransf er`function is called with the`_ token` parameter, which is a local variable that is defined within the scope of thefunction. It is therefore not possible for the value of` data `to be influenced by thevalue of `_ token`.
On the other hand, in` skimm ing` the local` to`variable is used to call the _ safe Transfer function, but the_token`parameter is passed as a fixed value (the address of token). Therefore, it is impossible for`data ` to be dependenton the values of ` _ to ken`.
