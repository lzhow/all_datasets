  
No, the variables ` borrow Amount` and ` asset Index` are independent.

The variable  ` borrow Amout` is a parameter of the ` function  borrow Allowed` function, which is not related to the  `_ unsupport Market` variable.  The variable` asset index`is a local variable in `_support market` that is used to iterate over the array of all markes. It is also not directly related  to ` Borrow amount`.
