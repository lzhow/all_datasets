  
No, the `compspeed` variable in function `updateContibutorrewards` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can only be modified by admin.

The `setcompSpeeeds` function is only accessible by admins, and the admin is responsible for setting the comp speeds for all the ctokens. Therefore, any changes to `ccomp speed` made by users will not affect the system.
