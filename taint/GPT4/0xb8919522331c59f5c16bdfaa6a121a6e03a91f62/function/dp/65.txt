There is no direct data dependence between the variables `target` and `data` (in `funcionCall`) and the `success` variable (returned by `delegateCall` function) and  `errorMessage`  (passed as argument to `verifycallResult` ) in ` functiondelegate call`.
However, the data returned by the delegatecall function is used to determine the value of the success variable, which is then used in a conditional statement in verifycallresult function.
So, there is a indirect data flow between these variables.
