  
No, the variables `_operators` and `_partiton` are independent.

In the `authorizeOperatprByParition` function, `_operation` is a parameter that is passed in by the caller, and it is not dependent on any other variable in that function. Similarly, ` _revokeOperator` does not depend on `_parition`.
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is no.
