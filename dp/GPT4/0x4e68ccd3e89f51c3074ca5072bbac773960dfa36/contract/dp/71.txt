Reason: The variable `self` in the function `clear` is a mapping of `int24` to `Tick.Info` that is used to delete a specific `Tick.Info` entry from the mapping. The function `clear` does not read from or write to any other variables outside of its own scope, and it does not use any external state or variables passed to it to perform its operation.

On the other hand, the variable `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` in the function `cross` is used to update the `feeGrowthOutside0X128` property of a `Tick.Info` entry within the `self` mapping. The `cross` function calculates new values based on the current state of the `Tick.Info` entry and the passed `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` value.

Since the `clear` function's operation of deleting an entry from the `self` mapping is independent of the `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` value used in the `cross` function, there is no data dependency relationship between the variable `self` in `clear` and the variable `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` in `cross`.
