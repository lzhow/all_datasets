  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `assembly` block is used to retrieve the size of the contract at the specified address using the`extcodeszie` function. This size is stored in a local variable called ` size`. The `return` statement then checks if the value of `siz`e is greater than 1, indicating that the address is a contract.
 In the second function , the same ` assembly`block is again used, but this time to check if a different address ` account` is also a valid contract address. However, this function does not use the local ` siz `e variable, and instead uses a new local variablenamed `accoun`t. Therefore, ` accoun `t is data-dependent on ` acount` because it is derived from the input parameter `acount`.
