  
The variable 'swapdata' in function 'doSwaTthroughOrinPool' is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user through the 'Swappedata' parameter.

This is because the parameter 'swappedData' of the doSwiptThooughorionpool function takes in a struct of type 'Internal Swap Data' which contains a field called 'path' that is an array of addresses. This field can potentially be manipulated by an attacker to cause the contract to swap tokens in an unauthorized manner.
