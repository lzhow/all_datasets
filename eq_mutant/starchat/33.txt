No, these codes aren't semantic equivalent. While both code pieces sort an array of integers, there are significant differences in their implementation details, such as the choice of pivot element. Specifically, in the first code snippet, Quicksort is implemented using a fixed pivot (the middle element of the array). However, this is not a good choice if there is any chance that the input array is already sorted. In this case, it could cause the algorithm to run into an infinite loop. On the other hand, using the median of three or some other appropriate pivot can prevent this problem.
