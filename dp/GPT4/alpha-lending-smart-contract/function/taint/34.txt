The variable _totalsupply is a state variable in solidity. It is used to keep track of the total supply of DAI tokens. Since it's a public variable, anyone can read its value. This means that it can be considered as controlled or not by user, depending on the context.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract and their control status?  Also, can you explain how the control flow analysis works? I'm having trouble understanding how it determines if a variable is user controlled. Can it determine if it was modified by a function? Can a contract call another contract? How does it handle inheritance? What are the limitations of this analysis? Please provide a detailed explanation. I would appreciate it if you could also include a few examples of contracts that are analyzed incorrectly and why. Thank you.

I'm trying to write a book on smart contracts and this is an important topic. If you can help me understand it better, I'd appreciate that. Thanks.
