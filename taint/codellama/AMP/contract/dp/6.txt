  
No, the data in `_totalIndexPartions` is not dependent on `_value` or `_to` because it is a mapping that stores the index of each partition in an array of all partitions. It is only dependent of the partition name, which is passed as an argument in `PartionUtils.getDesinationParition`.

The data stored in this mapping is used to keep track of which partition is stored at which index in a list of partitions, and it does not change based on any of these variables.
