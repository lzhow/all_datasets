  
No, the `_ token  ` variable in function `initialize` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` initialize` function is called by `PanCakery` contract, and it passes the `token  address` as a parameter to the constructor. Therefore, `_toke  n` variable is set to a specific value when the contract is deployed, which is determined by whoever deploys the smart contract. It is therefore not under the control of the end user, but rather under control by someone who deplys the Smrt contract .
