  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiy





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to a server during development. This is achieved by bundl ing all the files that are required to run a web page into a single file, which can then be served to users. An incremental bundle is created by comparing the dependencies of each file in a project to those that were included in an existing bundle. Only the changed files are re-bundled, resulting in faster reloads and a reduced
