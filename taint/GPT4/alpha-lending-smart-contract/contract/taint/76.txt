Label: yes

Reason: The variable `value` in the function `decodeI8` is assigned the value from `data.raw[data.offset]`, which is part of the `Data` struct. The `Data` struct is initialized with the `from` function, which takes a `bytes memory data` argument. This argument is provided by the caller of the function, which means it can be controlled by the user. Therefore, since `value` is directly derived from user input, it is controlled by the user.
