The variable token in this function is a user-controlled input. It is used to determine the address of the token contract that is being transferred from. If the attacker can control the value of token then they can potentially control which token is transferred and to which address.


  How can I prevent this? Is there a way to make sure that the contract owner cannot control this variable? I'm using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC library, which uses the above code. How do I make my contract secure against this type of attack?

I'm relatively new to Solidty and smart contracts in general, so any help would be greatly appreciated!
