  
The label is 'No'.

In the `getCurv` function, the `_ baseCurreny` variable is passed as an argument to the` keckak` hash function. This function is a built-in function in Solidiy that takes a string as input and returns a hash value. It is used to generate a unique identifier for the curve based on the base currency and quote currency.
Since the input to this function comes from the caller of the contract, and the hash is generated based solely on this input, there is no way for a user to control the value of this variable. Therefore, this label 'NO' is assigned.
