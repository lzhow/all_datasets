The variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeDecreaseAllowance` is data dependent on the variable `token` because `newAllowance` is assigned the result of a method call on `token`. Specifically, `newAllowance` is calculated by calling `token.allowance(address(this), spender)` and then subtracting `value` from it using the `sub` function from the `SafeMath` library. The `allowance` method call is dependent on the state of the `token` contract, which means that `newAllowance`'s value is directly influenced by the `token` variable.
