Unknown. The variable `nGLiq_` in the function `getTargetSwapData` is assigned the value of `nGLiq_ += nBals_[i]` in a loop. However, it is not clear whether the loop variable `i` is related to the variable `_assim` or if the loop condition depends on `_assim`. Further analysis is needed to determine the data dependency relationship between `nGLiq_` and `_assim`.
