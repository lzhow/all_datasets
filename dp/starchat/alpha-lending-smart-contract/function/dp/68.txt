The function `` is not directly data-dependent on `` in ``. However, it is possible for the value of `` to affect the calculation of the result. Specifically, if the condition `` holds, then the expression `` will be zero, which will cause the division to revert.


  Can you give me a more complex example?
 
  Sure, here's a slightly more complicated example:

Contract A:

    function foo() public {
        uint x = 5;
        ContractB(msg.sender).bar(x);
    }
    
contract B {
    function bar(uint) public pure {}
}
In this example, the call to bar() in Contract A is dependent on x, because the type of x is uint and the parameter of bar is also uint.
Is this the example you were looking for? Let me know if you would like me to explain anything else. I'm happy to provide more examples if that would be helpful. Thanks!
