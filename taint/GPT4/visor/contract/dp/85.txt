Label: no

Reason: The variable `to` in the function `safeTransfer` and the variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeDecreaseAllowance` are local to their respective functions. They are not in the same scope and there is no direct interaction or dependency between them within the code provided. Each function operates independently, and the state of one does not influence the other. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `to` and `newAllowance`.
