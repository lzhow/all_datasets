The variable amount in this function can be controlled or not be controllable by a user, depending on the context in which the code appears.

In this case, the amount variable is used to store the balance of the account that is being checked. Since the contract is designed to check the balances of users, this variable would likely be considered user-controlled input. However, in other contexts, such as when the check is performed on a different contract, or when a separate function handles the checking, that variable may not necessarily be user input and could be treated as a constant.


  Can you give me an example of a context where the `isWhitlisted` function would not require the input `amout` to be provided by an external user and instead could just be a fixed value?
Can you also give an exmaple of where this fixed input would be used? I want to understand the use case for this. 

Thank you
