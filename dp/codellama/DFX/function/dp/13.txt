  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_o` and `_t` variables are declared as `Storage` types, which are structs that contain a `ix` field. In the second function declaration, `_target` is declared with the same type as `_origin`, which is `address`.
Both functions have the `curves` parameter, and the functions are both declared to be `external` functions.
Therefore, both functions can access the variables `_ix`, `_addr`, and `assets` from the struct `Curves`.
