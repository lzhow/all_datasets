The contract state `totalSupplyByPartition` is data dependent on the variable `_value` in the function `_transferByPartition`. This is because within the `_transferByPartition` function, `_value` is used to update the `totalSupplyByPartition` mapping for a given partition when tokens are transferred from one partition to another. Specifically, the `totalSupplyByPartition[_partition]` is decreased by `_value` when tokens are removed from a partition (`_removeTokenFromPartition` function) and increased by `_value` when tokens are added to a partition (`_addTokenToPartition` function). These operations directly affect the state of `totalSupplyByPartition` based on the value of `_value`.
