Label: No

Reason: The variable `self` in the function `clear` is a reference to a mapping of tick indexes to `Tick.Info` structs, which represents the state of various ticks in a liquidity pool. This mapping is typically part of the contract's state and is not directly controlled by the user. It is manipulated through the contract's functions according to predefined rules and logic set by the contract's code. Users can interact with the contract by calling its functions, but they do not have direct control over the internal state variables like `self`. The control over `self` is governed by the smart contract's functions and the conditions within them, which determine how and when the state can be modified.
