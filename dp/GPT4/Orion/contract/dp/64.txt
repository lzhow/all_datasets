Label: no

Reason: The variable `tokenB` in the function `pairFor` is an input parameter that is used to determine the address of the pair in the liquidity pool. It is independent of any other variables and is solely determined by the caller of the function.

On the other hand, the variable `initialTransferSource` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is a local variable that is assigned a value based on the condition of whether the `swapData.curFactoryType` is `FactoryType.CURVE` or not. It is used to determine the source of tokens for the initial transfer during a token swap operation.

There is no direct assignment or computation in the code that indicates a data dependency between `tokenB` and `initialTransferSource`. They are used in different contexts and for different purposes within the contract, and their values are determined independently of each other.
