The contract has 3 data dependencies:

- `_msgsender()` is called in `onlyOwner` and `_changeadmin`
`msg` is a global variable and is always available.
Therefore, `_sender` cannot be data-dependent on `msg`.
`_msgdata()` does not have any data dependence on its parameters. It is safe to remove it.


  Can you explain how the data flow analysis works?
 
  Data flow analyses are used to determine if a variable or expression depends on a certain value or set of values. In this case, we are trying to figure out if the `_implementation` variable in a `TransparentUpgradable` proxy depends upon the value of the `implementationAddress` parameter. To do this, the analysis starts by initializing the set `defs` to contain the definition of `_implemenation`. Then, it iterates over each statement in our contract and updates the definitions of variables as they're used. If the current statement assigns to `_implementaion`, it adds the assigned value to the list of definitions. Finally, if `implementatonAddress == implementation`, then we know that `_implmentation` must be defined in this branch of code. However,
