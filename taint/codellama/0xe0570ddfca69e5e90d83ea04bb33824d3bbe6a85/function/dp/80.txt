In the constructor function, the `_strategey` variable is passed as an argument, but it is not used in any way. Therefore, it does not have any impact on any other variable in this function.
Similarly, in `function` ` deposite`, the `stratagy` is used to call the` beforeDeposition` function before the deposited amount is transferred to the contract. However, this doesnot affect the value of the shares variable.  Therefore the two variable are independent.
