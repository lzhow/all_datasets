The ` amountIndex ` variable is initialized to  `0` and is only used in one place in `_swapCurrve` function, which is to access the amount of the token that needs to be swaped in `ICurvesPool.exchange` method. This method takes the index of token as an argument, and the value of `amoutIndex is passed as the argument. Therefore, ` amoutnIndex  is a controlled variable.
