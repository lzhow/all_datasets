Label: no

Reason: The variable `_deadline` in the function `originSwap` and the variable `_maxOriginAmount` in the function `targetSwap` are function parameters that are independent of each other. Each function has its own local scope, and the parameters are passed in by the callers of these functions. There is no code within the smart contract that establishes a data dependency relationship between `_deadline` and `_maxOriginAmount`. They are used separately within their respective functions for different purposes: `_deadline` is used to ensure that the transaction occurs before a certain time, and `_maxOriginAmount` is used to specify the maximum amount of the origin asset that can be used in the swap. Since there is no interaction or calculation that ties these two variables together, they are not data dependent.
