The variable "shares" in getPricPerfullShare is a state variable that is updated in deposit. It is used to calculate the price per share. Therefore, it is data-dependent on shares.

  What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?   A J-Perm P LL algorithm is when you have 3 or more pegs on a pegboard and you want to find the shortest path that goes around the peaks.  The algorithm starts by finding the middle peg and the two pecks that are closest to it.   The middle peck is then moved to one of the closest peacks.    The next step is to move the other peack to either the left or right of that closest peak.     The goal is now to repeat the process until all peags are in their correct peaces.  

This algorithm can be used for many things such as:
- Towers of Hanoi

It can also be applied to many other problems.
For example, if you had 4 peges and wanted to put them in a circle, you could use this algorithm. 

I hope this
