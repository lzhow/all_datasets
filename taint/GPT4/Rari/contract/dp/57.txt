Reason: The variable `borrowIndex` in the function `setCompBorrowSpeedInternal` is a local variable that is calculated within the function using the `borrowIndex()` function of the `CToken` contract. It is used to update the `compBorrowState` mapping for a given `CToken`.

On the other hand, the variable `borrower` in the function `flywheelPreBorrowerAction` is a parameter that represents the address of a borrower. This function calls `updateCompBorrowIndex` and `distributeBorrowerComp`, passing the `borrower` address and the `borrowIndex` obtained from the `CToken` contract.

There is no direct data dependency between `borrowIndex` in `setCompBorrowSpeedInternal` and `borrower` in `flywheelPreBorrowerAction` because they are used in different contexts and for different purposes. The `borrowIndex` is used to calculate the new borrow state index, while `borrower` is an address used to distribute rewards to a specific borrower. The two variables do not influence each other's values.
