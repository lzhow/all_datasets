Explanation: The variable `_i` in the function `get_D` is not data dependent on the variable `i` in the function `getAmountsOut`. This is because there is no direct or indirect interaction between these two variables in the given code. They are used in separate functions and there is no code that connects or shares data between these variables. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
