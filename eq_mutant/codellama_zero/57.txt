  
No. These two code snippets are NOT sematically equal because they produce different results. In the original code, `Bisect.sqrt()` computes the square root of a number using the bisection method. It takes a double value as input and returns the result as a square of the input value. However, in the mutated code snippet, there is an error in line 40. Instead of using `/  `, it uses `%  `. This change causes the code to produce incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, if we call `sqrt(4)` on the first code and `mutant. sqr( 8)` in mutation, we get `2.0` for the former and `-2147483646.998045` in latter. Therefore the output of these two programs are different.
