No, both the codes given are syntactically different and would not result in the exact same outputs. However, I can try to show you why the code would have different outputs:

- One of the differences is in line 53 where the array `a` is accessed at index `3` with the expression `number` and at line `56` the value of `i` in that expression is changed to `4`. This results in an array index out of bounds exception that causes the program to crash.
The other difference is that the original code has a function `insert` that is declared at the start of main and a recursive function called `iter` (lines 9-11) that calls `main` using a different argument. The mutated code uses a loop instead of a recursion, which can result differently in terms of memory usage and/or performance. You can modify the mutant code by changing the recursive call to a while loop to get the intended behavior.
