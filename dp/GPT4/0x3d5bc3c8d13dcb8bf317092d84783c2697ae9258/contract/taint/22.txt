Label: no

Reason: The variable `isComptroller` is declared as a `public constant` boolean with a value of `true`. Since it is a constant, its value is set at compile time and cannot be changed thereafter. Additionally, being a constant, it does not occupy storage space and is embedded into the contract bytecode. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user and cannot be modified by any function or external interaction with the contract.
