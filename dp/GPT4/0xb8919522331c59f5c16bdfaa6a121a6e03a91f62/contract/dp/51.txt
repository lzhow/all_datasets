Label: yes

Reason: In the Solidity code provided, the `functionCall` function internally calls the `functionCallWithValue` function, passing the `target` variable as an argument. The `functionCallWithValue` function then uses the `target` variable in its logic to perform a call operation. This establishes a direct data dependency between the `target` variable in `functionCall` and the `target` variable in `functionCallWithValue`, as the value of `target` is used to determine the behavior of `functionCallWithValue`. Therefore, the variable `target` in `functionCall` is data dependent on the variable `target` in `functionCallWithValue`.
