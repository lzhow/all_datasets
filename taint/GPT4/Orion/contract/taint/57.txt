Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `a` in the function `tryDiv` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, and its value is determined by the caller of the function. However, without further context or information about how the value of `a` is obtained, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not.
