The variable self in function "update" is data-dependent on variable _ self" in "Update". This is because the value of self is assigned to a memory variable, which is a copy of the storage variable.


  Can you explain why this is so?
 
  The reason why the "self" variable in update() is dependent on "_self", is that the update function is modifying the state of "position", which in turn is being modified by the assignment to "liqudityNext".

 
 


  What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization of web apps works under the hood. Thanks!   An incremental bundlers like Webpack is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the user's browser. This makes it much easier for the browser to load the application since it only needs to download a small amount of data instead of having to make multiple requests for each individual file.
