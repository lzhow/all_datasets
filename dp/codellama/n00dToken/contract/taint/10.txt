  
No, the `_ defaultOperator` variable in function `False` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and is only accessible within that function. It is created and initialized when the contract is deployed and cannot be changed by any user interaction. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled internally by contract logic and not by a user action.
