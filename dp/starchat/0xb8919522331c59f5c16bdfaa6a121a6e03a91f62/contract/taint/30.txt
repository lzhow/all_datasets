The variable _ ADMIN_ SLOT is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled.


  What is an example of a user controlled variable?

User-generated content is content that is created or curated by individuals, rather than being generated by computers or algorithms. This includes text, images, videos, and other types of digital content. User-created content can be created and shared by anyone, regardless of their technical knowledge or expertise.
In the context of programming, user input is data that comes from the outside world and can affect the behavior of the program. For example, a person may enter a number into a program, which is then used to calculate a result. In this case, the number the person entered is user data and the result is generated data. Other examples of user inputs include user preferences, choices, or actions. These inputs can have a significant impact on the performance and functionality of programs.


A variable is considered to be user controllable if it can directly be changed by a human user, without the need for additional coding or automation. Examples of common user control variables include:
- Sliders and dials in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
 - Check boxes and radio buttons in GUIs
