  
No, the ` feeon` variable in mint function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is assigned a value based on the result of the `_mantFie` function, which is a private function that takes two parameters `_reserver0` and `_reverser1` as input.

The `_Mintfe` is called in `mInt` to determine whether the fee should be charged or not. It checks if `factory` address is equal to `msg` sender address, and if so, returns `true` if `_klast` value is greater than  zero. If the condition is met, `kLas`t is set to the product of `reserv0 and reserve  `1`.
