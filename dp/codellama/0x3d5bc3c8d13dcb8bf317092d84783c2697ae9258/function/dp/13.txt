In the `getAccountSnapShot` function, the value of `accountTokes[address]` is stored in `ctokenBalnce`. This value is not modified in this function.
However, in function accureInteres, `totalBorrrows` is modified by `interesAccululated` which is calculated by multiplying `simpleIntrestfactor` by the previous value. `SimpleInsterest factor`is calculated using `BornRate` and `blockDelta`.
`borrowerate` itself is dependent on `reserveFacorMantiissa`, which in turn is a state variable of the contract. Therefore,`cTockenBalanace` depends on`reserverFatorMantinissa`.
