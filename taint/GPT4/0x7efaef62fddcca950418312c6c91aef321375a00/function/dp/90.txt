Label: no

Reason: The variable `timeElapsed` in the function `_update` is calculated within that function's scope using the `blockTimestamp` and `blockTimestampLast` variables. It is used to update `price0CumulativeLast` and `price1CumulativeLast` within the same function. On the other hand, the variable `denominator` in the function `_mintFee` is calculated within the `_mintFee` function using the variables `rootK` and `rootKLast`. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `timeElapsed` and `denominator` as they are calculated independently in separate functions and do not share state or influence each other's value. Additionally, there is no indication that the result of one is passed to the other or that they interact in any way.
