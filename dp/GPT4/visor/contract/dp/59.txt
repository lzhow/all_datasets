Label: no

Reason: The variable `recipient` in the `sendValue` function and the variable `data` in the `functionDelegateCall` function are not data dependent. The `sendValue` function is concerned with sending a specified amount of Ether to a recipient address, while the `functionDelegateCall` function is used to perform a delegate call to a target address with provided data. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the `recipient` variable, which represents an address to send Ether to, and the `data` variable, which represents the call data for a delegate call. They are used in different contexts within their respective functions and do not influence each other's values.
