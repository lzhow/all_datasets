  
No, the ` amounts` variable in ` buy ER C1 5  ` is not dependent on ` er c1  5   Amounts ` in` buy Jay ` .

The ` amount` s variable is a local variable that is defined within the scope of the` bu yER C 7 9 6 ` function. It is initialized to  zero and is then incremented by the amount of each NFT that the contract receives in a single transaction.
On the other hand, `er c  c  1   5    Am o u n t s` is an array of uint  types that contains the amounts of NF tokens that are being bought in each transaction . It does not affect the value of ` am o un t  s ` within ` bu  y ER  C  7  9  6  `.
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
