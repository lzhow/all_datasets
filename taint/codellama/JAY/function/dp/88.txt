  
No, the `saleNFTFfeEht` contract variable is not dependent on `ERc 71Amount` variable in function` buy Jay`.

The reason is that the`salesNTFfeeEHT`contract variable does not appear in any expression that involves the ERC 20Amount variable. Therefore, it is impossible for the value of the salesNtfFfEh variable to change based on changes to the erC2OAmount value.
