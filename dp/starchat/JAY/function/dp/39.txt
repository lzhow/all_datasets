Then, it calls the safeTransfer function on each of the tokens in order to transfer the amount of tokens to'msg.senders'.

In the context of this function, '_totalSuply' would not be data-dependent on 'amout' because it is not used in this context.

  Data-dependency is a term used by computer scientists to describe how one variable or value in a program depends on another variable, or set of variables. In the case of Solidty, data dependence is defined as the relationship between two or more variables in terms of how they affect each other.
For example, if a variable 'x' depends upon another 'y', then any change in 'Y' will cause a change to be made to variable x. This can be
