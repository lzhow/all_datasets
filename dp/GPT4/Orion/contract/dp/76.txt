The variable `c` in the function `mul` is not data dependent on the variable `a` in the function `div`. In Solidity, each function's local variables are scoped to that function and cannot be accessed by other functions unless passed as arguments or if they are state variables (which are not the case here). Since `c` is a local variable within the `mul` function and `a` is a local variable within the `div` function, there is no data dependency between them. Each function call operates on its own set of inputs and does not share state with other function calls in this context.
