Reason: The variable `result` in the function `borrowBalanceStored` is likely to be data dependent on the variable `borrowIndexPrior` in the function `accrueInterest`. Although the direct relationship is not shown within the provided code snippet, the context suggests that `borrowBalanceStoredInternal(account)` (which computes `result`) would typically depend on the current state of the borrower's balance. Since `accrueInterest` updates the `borrowIndex` (which is derived from `borrowIndexPrior`), and the borrower's balance is usually a function of the borrow index (to calculate the accumulated interest), it is reasonable to infer that `result` would be affected by changes in `borrowIndexPrior` through the update of `borrowIndex`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship because the output of `borrowBalanceStored` (i.e., `result`) is expected to reflect the accrued interest, which is calculated in `accrueInterest` using `borrowIndexPrior`.
