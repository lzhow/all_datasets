yes, the `IERC20.totalsupplybypartition` is data-dependent on `_Value` because it is used to calculate the new total supply after the transfer.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data dependence is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value depends on another. In the context of smart contracts, data dependences are relationships between variables that are used within a contract to determine the behavior of the smart contract. For example, if a variable `x` depends upon a value `y`, then any changes to `Y` will also affect `X`.

 
 
  
  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. How does it work? Explain it in simple terms.
  3. Why is it useful? Give an example use case.

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers are tools that optimize the delivery of web pages by combining multiple files into a single file. This can significantly reduce the number of requests made to the server, which can improve the performance of a web application. They achieve this by
