The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is data dependent on the variable `account` because the value of `size` is determined by the result of the `extcodesize` operation, which takes `account` as an input. The `extcodesize` operation is used to get the size of the code at a specific address, in this case, the address contained in the variable `account`. Therefore, any change in the value of `account` will affect the value of `size`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
