  
No, the variables ` absolute InputAmount ` and ` returned Ammount ` are independent.

The variable  `inputAmountAbsolut` is calculated in function  execute and is not dependent on any other variable. It is a local variable that is only used in that function.  On the other hand,  the  variable returned amount is also a  local  function variable in  get Returned Amoutns. However, it is dependent  on other variables such as  output balance change, total fee share, and totalfee amount. Therefore, these two  variables are  independent and do not have  a dependency.
