Reason: The variable `inv` in the function `mulDiv` is calculated entirely within the function using local variables and mathematical operations. It is derived from the `denominator` parameter, which could be influenced by the user if they are able to control the inputs to the function. However, the calculation of `inv` involves only deterministic mathematical operations that do not depend on any external state or user input beyond the initial parameters. The variable `inv` is an intermediate calculation for the modular multiplicative inverse based on the `denominator`. Since the user does not have direct control over the internal computation after providing the input, and the computation does not rely on any external mutable state, `inv` is not considered to be controlled by the user.
