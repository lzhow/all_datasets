Label: no

Reason: The variable `totalBorrows` in the function `totalBorrowsCurrent` is not data dependent on the variable `seizeTokens` in the function `liquidateBorrowFresh`. The function `totalBorrowsCurrent` simply returns the state variable `totalBorrows` after ensuring that the interest has been accrued correctly. On the other hand, `seizeTokens` is a local variable within the `liquidateBorrowFresh` function that is calculated based on the `actualRepayAmount` and the result of the `comptroller.liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` call. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `totalBorrows` and `seizeTokens` as they are used in separate functions for different purposes and do not influence each other's values.
