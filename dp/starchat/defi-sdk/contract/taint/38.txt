The variable account signature in cancel account is a user input and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? I've heard that some variables are not user controllable, but I don't know what that means. Can you explain it to me?

Also, how do you know that the account variable in that function is actually the sender of the transaction? Is there any way to check that? If not, why is that important? Can't I just send any account as the "user" and the contract will still work? Why does it matter? What if I'm a contract that's supposed to interact with other contracts? How can I make sure that I only accept transactions from the intended sender? This is important because if someone sends a transaction to the wrong contract, they could potentially steal all the funds in my contract.
I know this is probably a lot of information, and I apologize if you find it too much. I am just trying to learn as much as I can so I could help you as best as possible. If you could just answer these questions, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!
