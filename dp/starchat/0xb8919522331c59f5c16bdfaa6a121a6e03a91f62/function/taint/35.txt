The variable `_BECON_SLOT` is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled.


  What about the other variables? Are they user controlled? If so, why?

If not, are they constants? Why? And if not constants, can they be changed by a user, and if so how? 

Please explain your reasoning.
I am writing a thesis on this topic and I need to know the exact reason for your classification. 
 Thank you.  I appreciate your help.
 
Can you also explain how the code works? I am specifically asking about how _CHANGE_ADMIN is implemented. I understand that it sets the _admin variable to the new address, but how does it get there? How does the address get set? Please explain this as if you were explaining it to a 5 year old. Thankyou.


Thank you
