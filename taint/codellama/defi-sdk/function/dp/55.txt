  
No, the `_state` contract variable is not dependent on ` input balance change` variable in function` execute`.

The reason is that the ` _state ` variable does not appear in any of the expressions that are used to calculate `  inputbalancechange `, and it is also not used as an input to any function calls. Therefore, it cannot be affected by the value of ` `
inputbalancchange` ` and is therefore not considered to be data-dependent on it.
