The variable num in divScalrByEps is data-dependent on a because it is used in a multiplication.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data-dependency is a term used to describe how one variable or value in code depends on another. In the example you provided, the num variable in function "divScalarbyExp" is dependent on variable "a" in "mulEpx". This means that the value of num is determined by the input value a, and any changes to a will affect the output of the "num" variable. This can be a complex relationship and can have significant implications for how the code runs. For example, if a is changed, it may affect how many times the loop in this function runs, which could have unintended consequences. Therefore, data dependencies are important to consider when writing code, as they can lead to bugs and other issues.

In your example code you have two functions, "DivScalarExp", and "MulExp". The "Numerator" value is calculated in one function and used as an input in another function. These functions are related because
