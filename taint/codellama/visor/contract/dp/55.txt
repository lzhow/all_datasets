  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `tryAdd` function, the value of `c` is calculated as `uint c=a+b;`. This means that the result of the addition operation is dependent on both ` a` and ` b`. Therefore, ` c` depends on `  a ` and` b` .
Similarly, in ` sub`, the substraction operation ` uint c  =  b - a;` is performed. This operation also depends  on  both  `   a  and  c`.
Therefore, both variables ` `and ` are  data-dependent on each other.
