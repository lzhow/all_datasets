Reason: The variable `i` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is a loop index used for iterating over the `swapData.path` array. It is used to create a new path array `new_path` by copying addresses from `swapData.path` starting from the index determined by whether a factory is involved in the swap or not.

The variable `supportingFee` in the function `_swapCurve` is a boolean flag that indicates whether the swap should support a fee or not. It is used to determine how amounts are calculated and whether the balance before and after a swap should be checked to calculate the fee.

The two variables `i` and `supportingFee` operate in different scopes and serve different purposes. The loop index `i` in `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is not influenced by the value of `supportingFee` in `_swapCurve`, nor does it affect it. They are used in separate functions and their values are determined independently of each other. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `i` in `doSwapThroughOrionPool` and `supportingFee` in `_swapCurve`.
