The variable `_p` in the function `updateFees` is not data dependent on the variable `nftsBought` in the function `getTotals`. 

Reason: The variable `_p` is calculated based on the value of `_price`, which is obtained from the `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` function. On the other hand, the variable `nftsBought` is updated in the `buyNFTs` function when NFTs are bought. There is no direct assignment or calculation between these two variables, indicating that they are not data dependent. Therefore, the label is 'no'.
