  
No, the `_ balances ` variable in function ` _ move ` is NOT controlled  by user .

The `_move` function in `ER7C 7  ` contract is responsible for moving tokens from one address (`from`) to another address(`to`). The function takes in several parameters, including the `operator`, `from`, and `to` addresses, as well as the amount of tokens to be transferred.
  The `_ move`function is called by other functions in  the contract, such as `_send` and `_burn`, to move tokens between addresses.  It is important to note that the`_move ` function does not directly interact with the blockchain or user input, and therefore the balance of the tokens is also not user controlled.
