Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_decimals` is not referenced or used in any way within the function `nonces`. The function `nonces` only accesses and returns the current value of the mapping `_nonces` for a given `owner` address. Since `_decimals` is not involved in the computation or return value of the `nonces` function, there is no data dependency relationship between `_decimals` and any variable within the `nonces` function.
