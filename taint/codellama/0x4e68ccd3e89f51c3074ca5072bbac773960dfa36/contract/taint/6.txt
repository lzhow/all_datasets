  
No, the ` quotinent` variable in get NextSQRTPrice FromAmount  is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated within the scope of the getnextSqtPricefromAmount function.

The `getNextsqrtPrice` function takes in four parameters: `sqrtpx9`, `liqudity`,`amount`, and `add`. The `amount` parameter is passed in by a user, but the other parameters are not. Therefore, `quoient ` is a calculated value that depends on the values of ` sqrpx 9` and`liquity` but not on ` amount`.
