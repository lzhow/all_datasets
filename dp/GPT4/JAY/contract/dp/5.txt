yes

The variable `total` in the function `buyJay` is directly dependent on the variable `erc721TokenAddress` in the same function. This is because `total` is initially set to the length of the `erc721TokenAddress` array:

```solidity
uint256 total = erc721TokenAddress.length;
```

This line establishes a direct data dependency, as the value of `total` is determined by the number of elements in the `erc721TokenAddress` array. If the length of `erc721TokenAddress` changes, the initial value of `total` will also change accordingly.
