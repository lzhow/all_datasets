Label: yes

Reason: The variable `time` in the function `binarySearch` is directly passed as an argument from the function `getSurroundingObservations`. This means that the value of `time` used in `binarySearch` is dependent on the value of `time` that is passed to `getSurroundingObservations`. When `getSurroundingObservations` calls `binarySearch`, it provides its own `time` parameter as an argument, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two `time` variables.
