  
No, the ` i` variable in function `_swap` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a loop variable that is used to iterate over the elements of the array `path`. The value of ` path` comes from the input parameters of function `addliquidtyFromexchange` and is therefore controlled the the caller of this function. However, `  i ` is a local variable and its value is determined by its own code, and it does not depend on any user input. Therefore, we can say that `   i  ` variable is uncontrolled by  the  user in this context.
