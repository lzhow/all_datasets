Label: no

Reason: The variable `amountInWithFee` in the function `getAmountOut` is calculated solely based on the input parameter `amountIn`. It is defined as `amountIn * 997`, which does not involve any other variables from the function `getReserves`. On the other hand, `reserveIn` is a variable that is set within the `getReserves` function based on the reserves obtained from a Uniswap pair contract. There is no direct data flow or computational dependency between `amountInWithFee` and `reserveIn` as they are derived from separate sources and their calculations do not intersect. Therefore, `amountInWithFee` is not data dependent on `reserveIn`.
