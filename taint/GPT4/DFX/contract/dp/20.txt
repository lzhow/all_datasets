The variable `oAmt_` in the function `targetSwap` is not data dependent on the variable `nGLiq_` in the function `getTargetSwapData`. 

Reason: The variable `oAmt_` is assigned the value returned by the function `Assimilators.intakeNumeraire`, which does not depend on the value of `nGLiq_` in `getTargetSwapData`. The value of `nGLiq_` is used in `getTargetSwapData` to calculate the trade, but it does not directly affect the value assigned to `oAmt_`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
