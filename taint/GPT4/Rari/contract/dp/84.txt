Label: no

Reason: The variable `c` in the function `sub` is calculated as the result of subtracting `b` from `a`, and its value is entirely independent of the `errorMessage` parameter. The `errorMessage` parameter in the `mul` function is used only for the `require` statement to provide an error message in case the multiplication check fails. There is no data flow or computational dependency between `c` in `sub` and `errorMessage` in `mul`, as they are used in separate functions and for different purposes. Each function's scope is isolated, and the variables within them do not interact or influence each other.
