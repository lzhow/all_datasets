The variable `reserve1` in the function `_swap` is assigned the value of `reserve0` or `reserve1` depending on the condition `input == token0`. However, it is not clear from the given code whether `reserve0` or `reserve1` is the same as `reserveA` in the function `_addLiquidity`. Therefore, the data dependency between `reserve1` and `reserveA` cannot be determined with certainty.
