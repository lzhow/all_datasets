Semantic equality or Sameness

The main criteria for two code pieces to be considered semantic-ally or syntactically equal is that the computer system would return the identical result (same output) when given identical input (unless the calculation is non-deterministic and relies on external randomness such as timing or system clock).
However, for any given program to accomplish this, there are three prerequisites:
1. Correctness: The program's output should be correct for all valid inputs.
2. Efficiency: In terms of time and/or space complexity, the program should perform efficiently. This may require optimizations to the code. 
3. Completeness: It is unreasonable to require the entire program be semantic and syntactically identical. 
Therefore, it is difficult to define what makes two pieces of code semantic equal and is left to individual programmers to determine.
