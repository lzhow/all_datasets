The variable _ assim in this function is a contract address that is passed in as an argument. It is possible for the address to be controlled externally, but it's not clear from the code how this could happen.

Thank you





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an incremental bundling approach? How does it work? Please provide some examples. Thank you!




An incremental bundle is like a big box that you can put things in, and it will make a bundle out of them. But it only makes the bundle when you're ready. This is useful because it lets you make lots of small changes and see the results quickly, without waiting for a complete re-bundle every time.
So, for example, if you have a JavaScript file that depends on other files, you don't want to have to wait
