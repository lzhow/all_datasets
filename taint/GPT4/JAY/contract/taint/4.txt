Explanation: The variable `_totalSupply` is not controlled by the user. It is a built-in variable in the ERC20 contract that represents the total supply of tokens. The value of `_totalSupply` is determined by the initial token supply set in the constructor and the subsequent token minting and burning operations performed by the contract itself. The user does not have direct control over this variable.
