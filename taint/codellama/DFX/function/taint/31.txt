  
No, the ` t Amt_ ` variable in view Origin Swing is uncontrolled by user because it's a local variable that is only used within the view origin swap function. It is created and assigned a value within this function, and it does not have any external dependencies. Therefore, its value is determined solely by its own code, which is within its control.

The variable is used to store the output amount of the origin token after the swap, but it doesn't have a direct relationship with any user input. Instead, this value depends on the input amount, origin and target tokens, curve parameters, etc. which are all determined by other factors.
