Reason: The contract state `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` is a bytes32 constant that represents a specific storage slot in the contract where the address of the current implementation is stored. The variable `newImplementation` in the function `_authorizeUpgrade` is an address that is intended to be the new contract implementation address. The function `_authorizeUpgrade` itself does not directly modify `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`, but it is called by the `upgradeTo` and `upgradeToAndCall` functions, which in turn call `_upgradeToAndCallSecure`. This function calls `_setImplementation`, which actually updates the value stored at `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` with the address held in `newImplementation`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` and `newImplementation` because the value of `newImplementation` is used to update the state stored at `_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`.
