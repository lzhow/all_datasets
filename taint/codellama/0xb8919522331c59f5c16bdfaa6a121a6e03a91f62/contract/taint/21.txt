  
The variable 'data' in function 'upgrateToandCall' is 'controlled by user'.

This is because the ' data' variable is passed as an argument to the '_upgradetoAndcallSecured' function, which is a low level call that can be used to execute arbitrary code. Therefore, the data variable can potentially be controlled or manipulated by an attacker.
