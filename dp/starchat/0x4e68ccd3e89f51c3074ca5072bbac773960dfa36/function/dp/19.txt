The function "sub" has two parameters "x" and "y". The function checks if the expression "z=x-y" is less than or equal to "X" based on whether "Y"is greater than  or lesser than zero.

If we look at the first line of the code, we can see that the value of "Z" depends on both " X"and " Y".
On the other hand, if we examine the second line, the values of Z depend only on " x", since the " y" parameter is not used in this expression.
