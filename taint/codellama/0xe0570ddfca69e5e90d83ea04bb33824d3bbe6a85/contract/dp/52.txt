  
No, the variables `_appovalDelay ` and `_ diff` are independent.

The variable  `_ approvaleDelay  ` is a parameter passed to  the constructor of the contract, and it is set to a fixed value when the  contract is created. It is therefore not dependent on any other variable in  this contract.  On the other hand, `_  diff  _` is calculated in function  withdraw, which is dependent  on  other variables in this  function. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a  data-dependent variable.
