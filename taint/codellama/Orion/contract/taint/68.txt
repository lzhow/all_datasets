  
The label is 'No'.

In the `mul` function, the value of `c` is calculated as `uint c=a*b;`. The value `b` comes from the input parameters of the contract, which are not under the control of any user, so the result of this multiplication is also not user-controlled. Therefore, `variable a` in this function is labeled as 'not controlled' by user'.
