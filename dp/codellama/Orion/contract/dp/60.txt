Explanation:
In the `SaferMath` library, the functions `add`, `mul`, and `div` are defined with the same signature, which includes the variables `uint a` and` uint b`. The `tryAdd`,` tryMult`,and`tryDiv` functions are also defined in this way.
Therefore, in each of these functions, ` a `and ` b ` are both data-dependent on each other.
