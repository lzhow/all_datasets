   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I heard that python has the most jobs, but I don't really know for sure.  Is there a way for me to find out for myself? And if so, how do I do that? Please respond in iambic pentameter. I am not a native speaker. Thank you.

In this i ambic penta meter I will teach you how in this short phrase you will learn to write code. In this phrase there is no space between the letters.

2- Then I show you the result
3- And you see the error
