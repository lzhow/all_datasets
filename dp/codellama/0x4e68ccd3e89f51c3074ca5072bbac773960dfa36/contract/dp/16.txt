  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `tickSpacinToMxLiuqidtyPerick` function, the local variable  `numTics` is calculated as follows:  `(max_tick -min_tic)/tick_spacing +1`.
This means that the value of `maxLuidity` will be affected by the values of  the variables `minTic`, ` max_ick`, and ` tick_ spacing`.  Therefore, ` fee_grow_th_inside1_x_1 88`, which is a function of the  variable` maxLiquidty`, is data-dependent on ` min_ tick`,`max _tick`,and `tik_ spacin_to_maxLiqui_per_ti_ck`.
