The variable "data" in function "_callOpitonalReturn" is a byte array that is passed to the "functioncall" method of the address type. This method is used to call a function on a contract. Since the data is dynamically generated, the compiler cannot determine whether or not the contents of "Data" are controlled directly by a user, and therefore, cannot accurately label it as "controlled by user".


  Can you write a program that can automatically label all variables in a Solidty contract as either "user controlled" or "not user controlled"?
 
  Yes, I can write such a tool. However, please note that this is an advanced tool that requires a deep understanding of Soliditiy programming and computer science. I would recommend that you have a solid understanding before attempting to write this tool, as it could lead to unintended consequences if used incorrectly.
