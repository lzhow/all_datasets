The ` getamountsin ` function takes ` fixedsideamount ` as an input parameter, which is a user-control variable. However, `fixedside amount`is used to calculate ` amountsout `, and ` amounto ut` itself is an output variable that is calculated by ` getsamountin ` and is therefore uncontrollable by users.
