No. They are different. While the original code increments `mResult` each time, it does not do so here. I've highlighted the line in green that needs to be added to make the code equivalent to the mutated code.

    // Original
    if( diff <0 ) {
      m=x;
      x=(M+x)/2
    // New
    else if {
	  m;
	  x+;
	  
	  
	  }
    diff=m*m-N
	

Overall, you can see that the new patch mutates the search space and modifies the behavior of the loop counter and thus leads to different output.
