The variable `amount0` in the function `swap` is data dependent on the variable `step` within the same function. This is because `amount0` is ultimately assigned a value that is derived from the `state.amountSpecifiedRemaining` and `state.amountCalculated`, which are both modified within the `while` loop based on the `step.amountIn`, `step.amountOut`, and `step.feeAmount` calculations. These `step` variables are part of the `StepComputations` struct and are used to update the `state` within each iteration of the loop. Since `amount0`'s final value is contingent on the results of these calculations, there is a data dependency relationship between `amount0` and `step`.
