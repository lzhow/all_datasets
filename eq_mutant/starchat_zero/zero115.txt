The two provided C codes, when compared line by line, do not appear to be semantic equivalent. The first code segment contains an infinite loop, while the second code additionally decrements the variable `diff` inside the while loop. While the program may produce the correct result for a given input, the behavior of the code may be unexpected or differ from that of its original counterpart.

In conclusion, based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine if these two code segments are functionally equivalent or not, and therefore, they cannot be considered semantic equal in this context.
