In the `_ verifyCallResults` function, the ` retuendata ` variable is used as an argument to the` revert` instruction. This instruction reverts the execution of the contract and returns the data in `retrundata`. Therefore, `returnData` is data-dependent on ` error Message` because it is passed as a parameter to ` revert`.
