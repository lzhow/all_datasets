   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to a course that will probably end up teaching me nothing but painful memorization of arcane syntax.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I have heard that it is easy to pick up, but what does that mean? Are there some things I need to focus on that are different from other languages I know? What popular textbooks or courses can I use to start learning Python quickly? Please respond in bullet point format. I also need a rundown of the most common data types in Python and when to use them. For example, I've heard people say "strings are the strings", but I don't know what that means. Are they strings in quotes? In quotes and double quotes, or something else? Can you explain that to me? Thank you!

 
  Here are several good places to begin learning the Python programming language:

   1. Official Python website: https://www.python.org/
   2. Codecademy: www.
