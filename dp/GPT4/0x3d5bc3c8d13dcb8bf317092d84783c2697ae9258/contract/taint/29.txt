Label: yes

Reason: The variable `repayAmount` in the function `liquidateBorrowAllowed` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is meant to be called from outside the contract, typically by a user or another contract. Therefore, the value of `repayAmount` is controlled by the user who calls the function, as they specify the value when initiating the transaction.
