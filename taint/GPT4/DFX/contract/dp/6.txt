Yes, the variable `curves_` in the function `proportionalDeposit` is data dependent on the variable `_newShells` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of `curves_` is assigned the value of `_newShells.mulu(1e18)` in the `mint` function, which is called within the `proportionalDeposit` function. Therefore, the value of `curves_` depends on the value of `_newShells`.
