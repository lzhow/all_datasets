The contract has a function called `updateCompSupplierBorrow` which updates the `CompMarket` state for both the supplier and borrowing users.

In the case where the borrow speed is set to  non-zero, the code updates both `supplySpeed` and `BorrowingSpeed`.
This means that the state of `Supplying` is dependent on `SupplierSpeed`, and the same goes for `BORROWING`.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning how code.  The best way is to find a course or tutorial online that will teach you the basics of coding.   Once you have learned the basic concepts you can then move on to more advanced topics.
   
    What are some good courses or tutorials for learning python coding? I'm specifically looking for courses that teaches you from the ground up. I don't want to just learn the syntax of the language. Also, I would like to know if the course is for beginners or people who have some experience with programming. If you could also sort the courses from most beginner friendly to most advanced, that would be great. Thanks!
