  
No, the ` data` variable in function `_safe Transfer` is not dependent on variable` _ token  ` in ` skimming` function.

The reason is that the `_ safeTransf er`function is called with the`_ token` parameter, which is a local variable within the scope of thefunction. This means that it is only dependenton the value of`token` at the time the call is made, and not on any subsequent changes to thevalue of `token`.
On the other hand, in` skimm ing` , the localvariable` token ` is assigned the result of a call to` I ERC ​​2 5 . balance Of ( address ( this ) )`, which returns the current balance of tokens for the contract. Since this value can change over time, it means thevariable ` token ' in' skimmer 'is dependent  on external factors.
