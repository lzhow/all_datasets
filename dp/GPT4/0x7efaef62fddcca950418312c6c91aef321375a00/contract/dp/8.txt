The variable `token` in the function `_safeTransfer` is data dependent on the variable `_token1` in the function `burn`. In the `burn` function, `_token1` is assigned the value of the `token1` state variable, which represents one of the tokens in the pair managed by the contract. The `_safeTransfer` function is then called within `burn`, passing `_token1` as the `token` argument. This establishes a direct data dependency, as the value of `_token1` directly influences the behavior of the `_safeTransfer` function call.
