   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explaining it in simple terms is enough.    An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bundl ing together all the assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) required by a web page into a single file.
