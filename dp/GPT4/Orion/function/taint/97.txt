The variable `userAmountIn` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `userAmountIn` is determined by the input parameter `swapData.amount_spend_base_units`, which is provided by the user when calling the `doSwapThroughOrionPool` function. Therefore, the user has control over the value of `userAmountIn`.
