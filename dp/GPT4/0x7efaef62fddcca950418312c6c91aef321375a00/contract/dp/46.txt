Reason: The contract state `balanceOf` is a mapping that keeps track of the balances of addresses for the PancakePair contract. In the `initialize` function, `_token1` is set as one of the tokens that the PancakePair will manage. The `balanceOf` mapping will eventually be used to track the balance of `_token1` tokens that users have within the PancakePair contract. This means that any interaction with `_token1`, such as transfers, minting, or burning, will affect the state of `balanceOf`. Therefore, `balanceOf` is data dependent on `_token1` because the balance of `_token1` tokens for any address is recorded in `balanceOf`.
