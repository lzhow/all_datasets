The contract variable `opticalUtilisationRate`, which is used to calculate the interest rate, is data-dependent on `_optialUtilisatioRate`. However, the `contructor` function does not modify the value of `_optimialUtlisationRatet`. Therefore, `optimilUtilisatinoRate ` is independent of the constructor.
