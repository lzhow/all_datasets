  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `get` function, the local variable `_self` is assigned the value of the struct `Info` stored in `self[ keccack2( abi. encodePacket( owner , ticklower , tickerupper ) ) ]`.
Then, in line 3, `LiquidtyMath` adds `delta` to `_ self` and stores the result in a new variable called ` liquidtyNext`.  The `add` method in LiqidyMath is called with the arguments `_sefl` (which is a struct of type ` Info`) and ` delta`(which has type int 8).
Therefore,  ` Liquiitynext` depends on ` liquditydelta`.
