  
No, the variables `_operators` are independent.

The function `_isOperatorsForColaterlManager` takes three arguments: `_partition`, `_opertor`, and `_collatoralManger`. The function checks if the `_colaterManager_` is a collator manager and if `_operation_ is an operator for the collation manager. It does not use the argument `_operaor` from the `authorizeOpertor` function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
