In the `borrwoBalancestored` function, the local variable`result ` is assigned the value returned by the internal function`borroweBalanaceStorredInternal`. The ` borrowerBalancerInternal`function takes an `account` parameter, but it does not use it to calculate the result. Therefore, ` result` is not dependent on ` repaYAmount`.
On the other hand, in `repaYBorroWInternal`, the` repayaMount` variable is used to determine the interest rate to be accrued. However, this doesnot affect the calculation of the return value of ` borrowBallanceStore`. Therefore ` rePayAmount `is not a dependency of` result`.
