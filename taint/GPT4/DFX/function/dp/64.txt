Label: unknown

Reason: The code snippet provided does not provide enough information to determine if the contract state `numeraires` is data dependent on the variable `_epsilon` in the function `setParams`. The code snippet only shows a function call to `Orchestrator.setParams`, but the implementation of that function is not provided. Without knowing how `Orchestrator.setParams` is implemented and whether it modifies the `numeraires` state variable based on the value of `_epsilon`, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship.
