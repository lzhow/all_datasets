Label: no

Reason: The contract state `price0CumulativeLast` is not mentioned anywhere in the provided function `_mintFee`. The variable `denominator` is declared and used within the scope of the `_mintFee` function to calculate the `liquidity` variable. Since `price0CumulativeLast` does not appear in the function and there is no interaction or calculation involving `price0CumulativeLast` and `denominator`, there is no data dependency relationship between them. Data dependency would require that the value of one is calculated based on or affects the value of the other, which is not the case here.
