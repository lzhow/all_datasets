The contract has a function called `_setAllowance` that sets the allowance for a given token holder. This function is called in two places:

- In the `mintInternal` function, which is used to mint new tokens.
This function sets `state.transferAllowed[msgSender][spender] = true`.
`msgSnder` is `msg` (the current message sender).
'spender' is 'address spender'.
In the'redemption' function `redeeem`, the transfer allowances are reset to false. `for (i = allowList.next(i); i!= 1; i = alllowListNext) allowlist.set(allowList[i].token, msg.sendder, false);`
Here, `spendder` and `token` are both `address`.
