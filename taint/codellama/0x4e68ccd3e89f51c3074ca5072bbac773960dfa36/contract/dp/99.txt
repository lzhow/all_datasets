The variable blocktimestamp in function 'write' is not dependent on variable 'secondsperliquitycumultivex118' in 'observes' because the value of 'blocktimestamp' can be changed by the 'transform' function, which is called in write. This function changes the block timestamp of the observation. Therefore, the data in blocktime stamp is changed and is no longer dependent upon the secondsper liquidty cumulative x1 88.
