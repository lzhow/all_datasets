The variable `underling` in `getUnderylingPrice` is a local variable that is defined within the `if` statement, and it is only accessible within that scope. It is therefore not dependent on any other variable in any function. On the other hand, the parameter `ctoken` of ` getUndelyingPrice ` is passed as an argument to the method, but it does not affect the value of the local ` underling ` variable. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
