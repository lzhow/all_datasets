   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning howto code.  The best way is to find a mentor or a group of mentors who can help you learn the basics of coding.
   
    What are some good resources for learning python coding? I am specifically looking for a beginner friendly resource. I have heard that python has a reputation for being difficult to read, but I would like to know if there are any beginners friendly resources that can teach me the fundamentals of python. If there is something I should know before diving into python, please let me know. Thank you.

I have also heard of people who have found that the best method to become proficient in a new language is by practicing. What do you think about this method? Is it something that would work well for me? If so, how can I best practice? Please let my know your thoughts on this. 

Thank you for your time. Your help is much appreciated. Have a great day. 
  

 
  Python is an interpreted language, which means that you don't need to compile your code
