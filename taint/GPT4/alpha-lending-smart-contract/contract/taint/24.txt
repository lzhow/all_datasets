Yes

The variable `_baseBorrowRate` in the constructor of the `DefaultPoolConfiguration` contract is set by the value passed to the constructor at the time the contract is deployed. Since the constructor parameters can be provided by the user who is deploying the contract, `_baseBorrowRate` is indeed controlled by the user at the point of contract creation. After deployment, this variable's value can only be changed if there is a function within the contract that allows for its modification, which would also require appropriate permissions (e.g., only the owner can change it if such a function exists and is protected by a modifier like `onlyOwner`). However, based on the provided code snippet, there is no such function, implying that `_baseBorrowRate` is set once by the user during contract deployment and cannot be changed afterward.
