Label: no

Reason: The variable `_useAsCollateral` in the function `setUserPool` is used to set the `disableUseAsCollateral` property of a `UserPoolData` struct instance. This variable is not used in the function `calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmountExternal`, nor does it influence any of the calculations or return values within that function. The function `calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmountExternal` does not take any state variables as input, nor does it reference the `UserPoolData` struct or its `disableUseAsCollateral` property. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_useAsCollateral` and any variables in `calculateRoundDownBorrowShareAmountExternal`.
