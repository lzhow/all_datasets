In the `maintAllowd` function, the variables `ctoken`, `supplier`, and ` mintamount` are used to determine if a mint operation is allowed. However, these variables are passed as arguments to the method and are therefore not dependent on any other variables in this function.
On the other hand, in `_ setMarkedSuppyCapps` method, `ctokems` and`newsuppycap` variables used in a loop to update the supplycaps of the ctokens. These variables depend on each other because they share the same index in their respective arrays. Therefore, if the value of ` newsuppycaps ` changes, it will affect the values of` ctoken` because the two arrays share an index.
