In the `exchangeRatestored` function, the local variable err is assigned the result of the call to the internal function`exchangeStorredInternal`. This function returns a tuple containing two values: a Math error and a uint.
  The `mathError` variable in ` exchangeRatedStroed` is set to `Math.Error`.
   The` exchangeStroredInternal`function is called in` mintfresh` and the` err`variable is used to check if the exchange rate is stored. If the error is not `NO ERROR`, the minting process is aborted.  Therefore, ` err `is data-dependent on ` vars `in`m intfres`.
