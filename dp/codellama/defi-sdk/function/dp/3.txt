  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `callBytes` function, the line `uint[] amounts` is declared and initialized with the value of `abis.decoded(calldate, ...)`. This value is passed as an argument to the internal function `_getAmounOuts`. The `pure` modifier is used to indicate that the `_ getAmoutOut ` function does not modify the state of the contract.
Therefore, `amoutns` and ` amountOut s` are both data-dependent variables.
