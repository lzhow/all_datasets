  
No, the ` amount` variable in function `_granComp` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` _ grantcomp` function is called by admin and the amount is passed as a parameter to this function. Therefore, `Amount` cannot be controlled directly by a user and is considered uncontrolled.
