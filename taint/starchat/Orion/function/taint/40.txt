  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was five. Thanks!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples of tools that use them?

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to a server during development. This is achieved by bundl ing all the files that are required to run a web page into a single file, which can then be served to users.
Incremental bundlers work by watching the filesystem for changes to files, and bunding only the changed files into the output file. When a change is detected, only that file is re-bundled, rather than the entire application. Incremental bundlings
