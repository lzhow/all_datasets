  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `result` variable is calculated by shifting the value of `int65 ( x )` left by 16 bits and dividing it by ` y`. The value ` x` is used in this calculation, so it is data-dependent on `  x`.
Similarly, in function 2, ` result`is calculated in a similar way, using the same formula, but with ` int66( x)` instead of` int 32(x)`. Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on` x`, making `yes` the correct answer.
