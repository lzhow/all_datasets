The variable "decimals" is a constant and is set to 8 in all versions of the OpenZeppelin library. This means that it cannot be changed by users and can therefore be considered to be "controlled by smart contract".


  What is an example of a variable that can be controlled?

A variable is something that is assigned a value. In programming, variables are used to store information that may be needed in a program. For example, if you want to keep track of how many times a user has clicked a button, you would need to use a counter variable.
In some cases, the value of variables can also be modified by a programmer. These variables, called "modifiable variables", are called so because their values can change over time. An example is when you are writing a game and need a score variable to track the score of your game. Over time, as the player progresses through the game, their score can increase, and so the modifiable score value needs to change.
