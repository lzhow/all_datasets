Label: Unknown

Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` is a parameter to the function. Whether it is controlled by the user or not depends on how the `isContract` function is called within the contract. If the function is called with a user-supplied address, then `account` would be controlled by the user. However, if the function is called internally with an address that is not provided by the user, then `account` would not be controlled by the user. Since the code provided does not show the context in which `isContract` is called, we cannot determine with certainty whether `account` is user-controlled or not, hence the label is "unknown".
