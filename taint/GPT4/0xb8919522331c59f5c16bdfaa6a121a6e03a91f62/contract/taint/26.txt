Label: No

Reason: The variable `_admin` in the function `_admin` is a function that returns the address of the current admin. The admin address is stored in a specific storage slot defined by the constant `_ADMIN_SLOT`. This address is set during the deployment of the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract and can only be changed by the current admin through the `changeAdmin` function, which is protected by the `ifAdmin` modifier. This means that only the current admin can change the admin address, and regular users cannot control or change the `_admin` variable directly. Therefore, it is not controlled by a regular user but by the designated admin of the contract.
