  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `isContrac` function, the local variable 'account' is passed as an argument to the external function 'extcodesiize'. This means that the value of 'acount' will be used to determine the size of the contract at the specified address.
On the other hand, in ` functioncallWithvalue` the 'target' variable is used as the first argument of a call expression. This implies that ' target' has a dependency on ' account' because the address of contract is determined by the return value from the call. Therefore, 'Account' in 'iscontrac' function has data dependence on  'Target'  variable in  the  function  `FunctionCallwithvalue`.
