The variable _shells is a control variable that is used to calculate the amount of new shells to be minted. It is updated in each deposit transaction and is therefore controlled indirectly by users who are able to make deposiit transactions.


  What is an indirect control? Is it possible to determine if a variable is indirect controlled? If so, how?

I am asking this because I am writing a thesis on smart contracts and I need to know if I can use this tool to analyze smart contract source code. If it's not possible, I will have to find another tool.
If it can be determined if itâ€™s indirect, then I could use that information to improve my tool and make it more accurate. I would like to avoid wasting time if possible. 

Please let me know what you think. Is this possible? How would you determine indirect vs direct control if at all possible with the information I have provided? 
 Thank you.
 
Is it also possible for you to provide me with a list of all the variables and functions in this contract and their control properties? I want to have a complete list so I know exactly what I'm dealing with. This will help me in my analysis.
