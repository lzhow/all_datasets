  
No, the ` feeon` variable in function `_m intF ee` is not dependent on variable` _ reserve1 ` in ` swap` function.

The reason is that the `_ mintF fee` and ` _ swap ` functions are separate functions and do not share any variables. Therefore, any changes made to the value of `_ reserve 1 _` within the context of the` swap _ `function will not affect the calculation of` fee On _`.
