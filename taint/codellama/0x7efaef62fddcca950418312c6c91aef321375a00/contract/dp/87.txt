  
No, the variables ` to` and `_ token  ` are independent.

The variable` to ` is a parameter of the ` mint` function, which is passed in by the caller of this function. It represents the address of a user who wants to mint new liquidty tokens.  The variable  `_  token `, on  the other hand, is defined in  a different function called ` swap`. It is used to represent the token address that is being swapped. While both variables are related to tokens,  they have different scopes and are used for different purposes. Therefore, there is no data dependence between them.
