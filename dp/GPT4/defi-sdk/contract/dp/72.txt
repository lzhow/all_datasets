The contract state `_CACHED_CHAIN_ID` is not present in the provided Solidity contract code. Therefore, it cannot have a data dependency relationship with the variable `protocolFeeAmount` in the function `execute` or any other variable in the contract. Data dependency implies that the value of one variable is derived from or affects the value of another. Since `_CACHED_CHAIN_ID` does not exist in the code, there is no such relationship.
