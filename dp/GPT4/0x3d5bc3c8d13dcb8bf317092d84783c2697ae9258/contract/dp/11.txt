Label: no

Reason: The variable `cTokens` in the function `enterMarkets` and the variable `liquidator` in the function `liquidateBorrowAllowed` are function parameters that are independent of each other. Each function call operates with its own set of parameters, and there is no code in the provided contract interface that establishes a data dependency between these two variables. The `enterMarkets` function is used for a different purpose (likely to allow an account to enter multiple markets) than the `liquidateBorrowAllowed` function (which is used to check conditions for liquidating a borrower's debt). Since there is no shared state or interaction between these two variables within the contract's functions, they are not data dependent.
