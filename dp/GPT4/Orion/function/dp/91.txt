Explanation: 
Based on the provided code snippet, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `path` in the `_swap` function and the variable `curBalance` in the `_swapCurve` function. The two variables are used in separate loops and there is no direct assignment or usage of one variable based on the value of the other variable. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a clear data dependency relationship between `path` and `curBalance` without further context or code analysis.
