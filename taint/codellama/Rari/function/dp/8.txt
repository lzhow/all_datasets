In the `transerTokes` function, the local variable  `startinAllowence` is assigned the value of `uint(- 1)` if the spendee is equal to the source address, otherwise it is set to `tranferAllownces[source][speender]`.
However, in `exchageRateStoreInternal` the total supply is calculated using the get cahp prior function which is not defined in this code snippet.
Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the two functions have any data dependencies.
