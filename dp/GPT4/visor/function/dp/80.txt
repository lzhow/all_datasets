Label: no

Reason: The variable `s` is an input parameter to the `permit` function and is used as part of the ECDSA signature recovery process. It is passed directly to the `ECDSA.recover` function along with the hash of the signed data (`hash`), and the recovery parameter (`v`) to recover the signer's address. The variable `structHash` is a hash computed within the function using several other inputs, including the owner's nonce and the permit data. The computation of `structHash` does not depend on the value of `s`, nor does the value of `s` influence the computation of `structHash`. They are used in separate parts of the function for different purposes, and there is no data flow from `s` to `structHash` or vice versa. Therefore, `s` is not data dependent on `structHash`.
