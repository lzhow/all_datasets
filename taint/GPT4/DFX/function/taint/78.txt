Explanation: The variable `_amt` in the function `viewNumeraireAmountAndBalance` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function, but there is no indication in the code snippet provided that this value is provided by the user externally. Therefore, it cannot be determined with certainty whether it is controlled by the user or not.
