   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how. I want to do something useful with it, like make a game or something. But I also don't want it to be a waste of time. What do you recommend? I've heard some people say to just start with the basics and work your way up, but I don;t know where to start. Can you give me some good advice? Or at least a general idea of what I could do? Thanks.

I am also open to other languages if that is easier. If you could recommend a few good first languages I might be able to find someone to help me with each of them. For example, if I wanted to make an android app, I'd be happy to use Java, since that's what most android developers are using. Or if it's a web app I'm making, maybe I can start out with Javascript, or maybe even Types
