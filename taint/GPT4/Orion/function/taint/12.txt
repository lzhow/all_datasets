Explanation: The variable `curBalance` in the function `_swapCurve` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the value of `IERC20(path[i + 1]).balanceOf(address(this))` which represents the balance of a specific token held by the contract itself (`address(this)`). The user does not have direct control over this variable.
