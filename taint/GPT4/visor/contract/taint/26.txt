Label: No

Reason: The variable `_decimals` is a private state variable in the ERC20 contract, which means it is not directly accessible by external users or contracts. It is set in the constructor of the contract and can only be modified by functions within the contract that have the appropriate permissions. In this case, the `_setupDecimals` function is internal and can only be called by the contract itself or by derived contracts, not by external users. Since the constructor is only called once when the contract is deployed and the `_setupDecimals` function is not exposed to external users, the variable `_decimals` is not controlled by the user after deployment.
