   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning howto code.  The best way is to find a mentor or a group of mentors who can help you learn the basics.
   
    What are some good mentoring organizations?  I've heard of people talking about Girl Develop It, Code for America, and others. What do they do? What's the difference between them? I'm not sure where to begin. I just want to get into coding. Can you recommend some organizations that are beginner-friendly? Please be specific. Thank you.

I've also heard that there are coding bootcamps that can teach you the fundamentals of coding and help get you started. Are there any that you know of? If so, what are their requirements and what do you get? Thankyou. 

Please let me know if you need any more information. If you could also recommend a few organizations to me, that would be great. Thanks.
