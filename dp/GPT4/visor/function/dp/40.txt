yes

The variable `c` in the function `tryAdd` is data dependent on the variable `b` because `c` is assigned the result of the addition of `a` and `b` (`uint256 c = a + b;`). The value of `c` directly depends on the value of `b` at the time of the function call, as any change in `b` would affect the computed value of `c`.
