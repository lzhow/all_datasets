  
No, the variables ` deposit_ ` and `_ bal` are independent.

The variable` depos_ _` is defined in function` view Proporional Depos_it` and is used to store the result of the calculation of proportional deposited amount. This variable is not dependent on any other variable in this function.  On the other hand, variable _ bal_ is a local variable defined inside the ` get Gross Liquid_ity And Balances For De_posi_t` function and it is only used inside this scope. It is also not dependant on other variables in that function, so it does not affect the value of ` _ depos _`.
  In summary, ` de_ posit _ ` is independent of `_ ba_ l` because it has its own scope and doesnot depend on it.
