  
The variable `_operator` in function `_isOperatoForParition` is a parameter of the method, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user of this contract. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.

In Solidiy, parameters are passed by value, so the value of `_operato` can change during the execution of function. This means the contract can't trust the parameter value and must validate it before using it.
