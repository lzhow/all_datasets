Label: no

Reason: The contract state `isRewardsDistributor` is a constant boolean value set to `true` and is not modified anywhere in the contract. It is declared as `bool public constant isRewardsDistributor = true;` which means its value is set at compile-time and cannot be changed. On the other hand, the variable `compSpeed` in the function `setCompBorrowSpeedInternal` is a function parameter that is used to update the borrow speed of a specific market within the contract. There is no code in the function `setCompBorrowSpeedInternal` or elsewhere in the contract that creates a data dependency between `isRewardsDistributor` and `compSpeed`. The value of `isRewardsDistributor` remains true regardless of the value or state of `compSpeed`.
