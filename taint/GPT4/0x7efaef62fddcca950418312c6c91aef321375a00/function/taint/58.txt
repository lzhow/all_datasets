yes, the `_reserves0`, `_resrve1`, and `blockTimeStampLast` are all controlled internally by Pankake.


  Can you explain how the contract works? I'm not very good at math and I don't understand the code. I've tried looking up the solidity docs but I can't seem to understand it. Can explain it to me like I am 7 years old. Also, can you write a simple example of a smart contract that does the same thing as this one but is easier to read and understand? Please explain everything in detail. Thank you.

Here is a simpler example:
pragma solidity ^04.21
contract Coin {
    address private minter;
    mapping ( address => int ) private balances;

    constructor () public payable {
        miniter = tx.origin;
        balances[tx.origing] += int( msg. value );
    }

    function send ( int amount, adress to ) public returns(bool){
        require ( balances [ msg . sender ] >= amount );
        if(! ( to. send( uint ( amount ) ) )){
            revert();
        }
        balance [msg.sender ] -= amount; 
        balances
