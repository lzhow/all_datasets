The variable _Reserve1 is a controlled variable in Pankake Pair. It is used to calculate the price of the token pair.


  How does the program know that the `_Reserve` variables are controlled?  Is there a way to make it more robust?

I'm trying to understand how the code works, and I'm having a hard time figuring out how it knows that `_Reserv1 ` is "controlled".





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I'd like a TL;DR at the end. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bunding together the various components of a web project into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This helps to reduce the number of requests that a browser needs to send to a server in order to load a webpage, which can significantly improve the page load time.
