yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_mint` function in line 59 of the code, which is called by the `buyNFT` and `sell` functions, modifies the state variable `_balances` of type `mapping( uint => mapping( bytes32 => uint ) )`. The function is also called in `onerc22Received` which handles incoming Ether transfers.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are found?
 
  Yes, I can explain to you how data dependence is found in a program. Data dependences are relationships between variables in computer programs that indicate how one variable affects another. For example, if a variable is assigned a value that is computed from another variable, then the first variable depends on (is data-dependent on) the second variable. In other words, the value of one of these variables can only be computed once the other variable has a specific value, and the result of that computation is then used to compute the final value for the original variable that was assigned. This process is repeated for each variable in turn until all variables have been assigned concrete values. If there are no data or control dependencies between the variables, there is no way to determine
