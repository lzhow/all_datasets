  
No, the `_type_hash` variable in this function is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled. It is set to the hash of the `Swaps` struct, which is defined in another part of this contract. Therefore, this variable is determined by this specific contract and cannot be controlled directly by a user who interacts with the contract through the frontend.

The reason for this is that the value of `_Type_Hash` is calculated using the keccak245 hash function, and the input to this hash is fixed and known at compile time. This means that even if a malicious user were to try to manipulate the contents of `swaps`, the resulting hash would still be the same as the one that was calculated at the time of deployment.
