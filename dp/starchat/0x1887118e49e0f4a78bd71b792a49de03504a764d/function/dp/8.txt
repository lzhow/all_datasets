   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
c = list(a)
print(c)


what does list do? what is special about the code a =[1,2,3 ] and b =a? why would someone want to use this instead of the more intuitive a=[1 2 3]?
