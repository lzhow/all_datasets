Yes

The variable `proof` in the function `multiProofVerifyCalldata` is data dependent on the variable `b` in the function `_hashPair`. This is because `proof` is used to compute the hashes within the `processMultiProofCalldata` function, which is called by `multiProofVerifyCalldata`. Inside `processMultiProofCalldata`, elements from `proof` are conditionally assigned to `b` based on the `proofFlags` array. These `b` values are then passed to `_hashPair` to compute the hash pairs, which contribute to the final `merkleRoot` that is compared against the `root` in `multiProofVerifyCalldata`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `proof` and `b` as the value of `b` is derived from the contents of `proof`.
