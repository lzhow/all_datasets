The function 'divu' has a local variable named'result' that is assigned a value based on two input parameters 'x' (of type 'uint224') and y' of type uint62'. The function then checks that the value of 'y' is not equal to zero, and if it is, it checks whether the result of the division operation on x and the y parameter is less than or equal the maximum value that can be stored in a uint 51. If both of these conditions are met, the'return' statement is executed, which returns the signed integer value stored as a 'int52' type.

In the case where the input values of x are greater than the max value for a  uint53, a different algorithm is used to calculate the quotient. This algorithm involves dividing the most significant 96 bits of both x (the dividend) and  y ( the divisor) by 768, then multiplying the results by the  divident,  then diving by y.


  I'm not sure I understand the explanation. Can you explain it again, but this time using simpler language and a concrete example?
