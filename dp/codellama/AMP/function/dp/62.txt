In the given code, the `function isOperaterForParition` is a view function that takes three arguments: `_partition`, `_operator`, and `_tokenholder`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the `_operater` has the authority to manage the partition.
However, there is no variable or state named `colalteralManager` in this function. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether ` collaterlManager ` is data-dependent on ` _operatpr` or `_ tokenholder` based on this code alone.
