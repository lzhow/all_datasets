Label: no

Reason: The variable `result` in the function `exchangeRateStored` is obtained from the function `exchangeRateStoredInternal()` and is used within the scope of that function to return the exchange rate. On the other hand, the variable `error` in the function `_setReserveFactor` is obtained from the function `accrueInterest()` and is used within the scope of `_setReserveFactor` to handle potential errors during the interest accrual process. There is no direct interaction or data flow between `result` and `error` as they are used in separate functions for different purposes and do not share state or influence each other's values. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
