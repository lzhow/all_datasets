  
No, the variables `_oGliq` and `_totalShell` are dependent on `_depoist` but not on  `_lenght`.

The variable  _`multipiler` is dependent only on _ `depost` because it is calculated as `_withrawal` divided by `_totalsupply`. The variable _totasuppy is also dependent  on ` _ deposit` as it  is calulated as ` deposi`t divided  by `1 e16`.
