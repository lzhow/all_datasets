  
The label is 'No'.

In the `enterMarkests` function, the local variable 'len' is assigned the value of the length of an array of addresses passed as an argument. This value is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in `minVerity` the argument `actualMiintamount` is used to calculate the new value for the state variable`maxAsseets`. This variable is also used in a conditional statement to determine whether the supplier is added to the list of suppliiers. However, this does not create a dependency between the two functions.
