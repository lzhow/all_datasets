Reason: The variable `newPendingAdmin` in the function `_setPendingAdmin` is used to set the state variable `pendingAdmin` which is related to the administrative control of the contract. On the other hand, the variable `supplier` in the function `distributeSupplierComp` is a parameter that represents the address of a supplier in the context of distributing rewards. There is no direct data dependency between `newPendingAdmin` and `supplier` as they operate in different contexts and are not used to derive each other's values. The `newPendingAdmin` is related to contract administration, while `supplier` is related to the reward distribution logic.
