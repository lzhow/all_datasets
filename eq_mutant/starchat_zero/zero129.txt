The two provided codes do not have exact semantic equivalence. Even after applying the provided patch, there are still subtle differences between the codes, which may result in different outputs given same inputs.

Here's a detailed analysis of the differences:
* The mutated code assigns a negative value `b--` to `mid` in the line `13`. This is because the value of `c` is already assigned in line 12 and `a` can be assumed to be greater than `0`. As a result, evaluating `if (b > a)` will always evaluate to true and assign `min` a value equal to the smaller of both `int`s. When `else if` evaluates ` if(b < 0)` and assigns `max` the non-positive value `-1` without checking if it is the new `middle` candidate, the previous code would assign the correct value to mid. 
```java
int min = Math.min(a, b);
//...
if(c >= min && c <= max) {
    //...
    mid= c;
}
else {
   //...
   mid += 2;
   }
 }
     return min;
    }
