Reason: The variable `borrowIndexNew` in the function `accrueInterest` is calculated within that function based on the current state of the contract and the inputs to the function. It is derived from the `borrowIndexPrior`, `borrowRateMantissa`, and `blockDelta`, which are all determined within the context of the `accrueInterest` function.

On the other hand, the variable `seizeTokens` in the function `liquidateBorrowFresh` is calculated based on the `actualRepayAmount` and the rules defined in the `comptroller.liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` function. It is related to the liquidation process and is independent of the interest accrual process.

There is no direct data dependency between `borrowIndexNew` and `seizeTokens` as they are calculated in separate functions and do not rely on each other's values. The `accrueInterest` function deals with updating the interest rates and the internal accounting of borrows and reserves, while `liquidateBorrowFresh` deals with the liquidation process in case of a default. The two processes are distinct and do not share state in a way that would create a data dependency between the two variables in question.
