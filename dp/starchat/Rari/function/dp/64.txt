The function add\_ has two parameters a and b. It then calculates the sum of a+b and assigns it to c. Then it checks if c is greater than or equal to a. If it is, the require statement evaluates to true and the code inside the curly braces is executed.

However, it's not clear what the purpose of the greaterthanExp function is. Without more context, I cannot determine if the left variable is used in any way within the body of this function.


  I am writing a thesis on smart contracts and I need to know if there are any tools that can automatically analyse the data dependencies in smart contract programs. Could you please tell me if such tools exist and if so, which languages are they written in?
 
  Yes, there exist tools and libraries that are specifically designed to analyze smart-contract programs and detect data-dependence relationships between variables and contract state. Here are some examples:

1. Mythril: MythX is a security analysis platform that uses symbolic execution to identify and analyze vulnerabilities in Ethereum smartcontracts.

2. Slither: Slitherr is an open-source static analysis framework for Solidty smartcontract analysis. 

3.
