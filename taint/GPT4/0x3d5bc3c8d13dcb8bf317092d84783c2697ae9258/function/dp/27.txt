Label: no

Reason: The variable `exchangeRate` in the function `exchangeRateStoredInternal` is calculated within that function using local variables and other function calls (`getCashPrior`, `addThenSubUInt`, `getExp`). It does not reference any external state that is modified by the `redeemAmount` variable in the function `redeemUnderlyingInternal`. The `redeemAmount` variable is used in `redeemUnderlyingInternal` to perform operations related to redeeming, but it does not influence the calculation of `exchangeRate` in `exchangeRateStoredInternal`. There is no direct or indirect data flow or dependency from `redeemAmount` to `exchangeRate` within the given code snippet.
