Label: yes

Reason: The variable `quotient_scope_0` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` is derived from the parameters `amount` and `liquidity`. The `amount` parameter represents the amount of a certain asset, which is typically provided by the user when they interact with the contract (e.g., when they want to swap tokens or add/remove liquidity). The `liquidity` parameter could also be influenced by user actions, as it represents the liquidity in a pool which users can add to or remove from. Since `quotient_scope_0` is calculated using these inputs, it can be influenced by the user, and therefore, it is labeled as 'yes', meaning it is controlled by the user.

Note: The actual variable name `quotient_scope_0` does not appear in the provided code. However, the explanation assumes that `quotient_scope_0` refers to the `quotient` variable within the `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` function, which is calculated based on user-provided inputs.
