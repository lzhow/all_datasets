Reason: The variable `blockNumber` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is used to calculate the number of blocks that have passed since the last update to the borrow index for a specific market. It is obtained by calling the `getBlockNumber()` function, which returns the current block number from the blockchain.

On the other hand, the variable `amount` in the function `grantCompInternal` represents the quantity of rewards to be transferred to a user. This variable is independent of the blockchain's block number and is instead related to the rewards distribution logic.

There is no direct or indirect relationship in the code between `blockNumber` and `amount` that would indicate a data dependency. The `blockNumber` is used for indexing purposes in the rewards calculation, while `amount` is used for the actual transfer of rewards. They operate in different contexts within the contract and do not influence each other's values.
