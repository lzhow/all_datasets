  
No, the ` exactin` variable in function `computeSwapsStep` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` computeSwaStep ` function takes in a ` sqrtratiocurrentx9` , `sqrtratargetx`9, `liqudity`, `amountremaining`, and `feepips` as parameters.  The ` amountremianing` parameter is a user-controlled variable. However, other parameters are not user controlled. Therefore, only the amount remaining is user controllable.
