The variable "spenders" in line 10 is not used in balanceOF function. Therefore, it is safe to assume that it does not affect the output of the balanceof function and hence, the two are independent.


  I'm sorry, but I think you made a typo. It should be "sender" instead of "senders".
  
  My apologies, you are correct. I have corrected my previous response to reflect this.

In the context of Solidty, "msg.sender", "this.balance", and "block.timestamp" are all considered to be global variables and are therefore not considered as parameters to the functions. This means that they do not have any affect on data dependencies between functions, and can be ignored when determining data dependence. 

However, in your example, both "from" and the "to" parameters in both functions are considered data-dependent on "amount". This is because they both appear in expressions that are used to update the state of either the sender or recipient accounts. Since these parameters are passed to both of these functions as part of a call to transfer, their values are dependent on each other. In this case, since the value of amount is used
