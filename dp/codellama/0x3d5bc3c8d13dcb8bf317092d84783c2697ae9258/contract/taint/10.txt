  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `Comtroller` interface, the contract has a function called `enterMarketing` that takes an array of `cToken` addresses as input. This function is marked as `external`, which means that it can be called from outside the smart contract.
  The `isComprtroll` variable is a public variable that is set to `true` in this contract, which indicates that the Comtrol is active.  This variable can only be changed by calling the`enterMaketing `function. Therefore, this variable cannot be controlled directly by a user, but it could be influenced by an attacker who can call the enterMaking function.
