In the `mul` function, the first argument `a` is a public variable that is passed as an argument to the method. It is therefore not under the control of the current user and is considered to be a constant.
On the other hand, `b` and `c` are local variables that are created within the scope of this function and are not accessible outside of it. Therefore, they are considered as controlled variables.
