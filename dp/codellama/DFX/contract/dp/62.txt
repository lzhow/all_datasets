In the `intakNumereireLP ratio` function, the `_baseweight` and `_quoteweight`, which are parameters of the same function are used to calculate the amount of `_amount` that is transferred to the treasurer.
Therefore, `_ amount` is data-dependent on `_ baseweight and _ quoteweight`.
Similarly, in ` transferfee` the _ amount is used as a parameter to transfer the fee to treasure. Therefore, ` _ amout`is data - dependent on `amount`.
