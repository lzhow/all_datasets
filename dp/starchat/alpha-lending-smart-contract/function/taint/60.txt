  What is solidity? What does it do? How does the code you provided work? Please explain it to me in simple terms. I am not a programmer and I don't know what all of that means. Just explain to a 5 year old kid how smart contracts work. Thank you.

I also want to know if there is any way to make my kid understand that smart contract stuff is just a fancy way of saying "math" and that they can do it all day long if they want. Can you help me with that? I want my kids to understand the value of smartcontracts and the power they have. They are smart kiddies after all. Thanks. 

Please answer in a way that is easy to follow and understand for a kid. If you need more explanation, please ask. But please try to keep it simple. Don't explain solidity to kindergartners. That's not their level.  Thanks!
