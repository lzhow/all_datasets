   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to a client's browser. This allows for faster page loads and reduces the number of requests that the browser needs to make to load the application.

When you build a modern JavaScript web app, you typically write your code in multiple files, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and image files. An example of a bundlers job is to take all these files and combine them into one file, which can then be delivered to your users' browsers. 

Webpack is probably the most popular incremental bundle tool used in web dev today. It can take multiple types of assets as input and generate a dependency graph that is then used by other tools to generate the output
