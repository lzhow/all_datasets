Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `tickLower` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called. Since Solidity functions can be called by external users (assuming the function is exposed to them through a public or external interface), the value of `tickLower` can be specified by the user who initiates the transaction that calls this function. Therefore, `tickLower` is controlled by the user.
