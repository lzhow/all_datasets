The variable balance is a local variable in function `burn` and is used to calculate the amount of token  to be burned, and the value of this variable is determined by balances of the two tokens in this contract. Since the contract is an ERC2O token contract, the balance of each token can be retrieved by calling the `balanceOf` function of IER2o token standard. Therefore, this value is considered to not be controlled directly by users.


  How can I check if a contract has a bug? I'm not a security expert, so I'd like to know if there are any tools or techniques I can use to check for potential vulnerabilities in my smart contracts. I've heard that static analysis tools can help me find potential bugs, but I don't know much about them. Can you recommend some resources or tools for this purpose? Thanks!
