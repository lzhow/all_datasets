   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:

a = 1
b=2
c=a+b
print(c)
what does each line do? and what is its output?
I would really appreciate your help!
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python?  What IDE should I use? What libraries should i use to make my life easier? Please provide a step by step process for me to follow.  I'm on a mac if that matters. Thanks!
Please respond as if I were a friend, not a computer.
