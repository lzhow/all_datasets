  
No, the ` success` variable in `_safe Transfer` is not dependent on ` balance 1 ` in ` burn`.

The reason is that the `_ safeTransfers` function is called within the context of the` burn`function, but the variables passed to it are `to` and `value`, which are defined within ` _ safe Transfer`. The ` balances` variables are only used within` _ update` within `_ burn`, and are therefore not accessible to `_ _transfer`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
