The variable reserve in getReserve is a state variable that is updated by calling the swap function in Unipwap. Since the getReseves function is called in a view function, the state variables are not updated and are therefore not user controlled.


  How can I make it so that the contract owner can withdraw funds from the smart contract?  I want to make sure that no one can take my money without my permission.  Please provide me with a Solidty function that can be called by anyone to withdraw all funds.   I will also need a function to allow the owner to set a new owner.    Please make these functions as reusable as possible.
