There is no direct data dependence between the two functions. However, there are indirect data dependencies.
In the `_getParitionStrategeyValidatorName` function, the `fromParitition` variable is passed as an argument. This variable comes from the same function that calls `_toParittion` and `_frompartition`.
This means that the data in `_operatordata` is dependent on `_topartition`. However this is not a direct dependence.
