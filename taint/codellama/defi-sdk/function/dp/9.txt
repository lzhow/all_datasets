Explanation:
In the first function, the `return` statement is dependent on `output` and `swap_type`.
`protocol_fee_amount` is calculated based on a calculation that includes `marketplace_F`ee and`total_ fee_share`.  `Total_ F`eeshare`is calculated using`market_place`fe`and` protocol_`Ffe.
Therefore,`return_Amount`,` market_Place_Fe`amount, and  protocol`_ Fe` amount are all dependent variables.
