  
No, the `_ token  ` variable in function `skim` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and is only accessible within that function. It is created and destroyed each time the `skin` function is called, and its value is determined by its initializer, which is a call to the ERC-2O `balancesOf` method. Therefore, its state cannot be controlled directly by a user, but it can be influenced by external factors such as the state of the blockchain and the actions of other contracts.

The variable `to` in `function skimm`is controlled the by  user  because  it  is passed as an argument to  the  function  and can  be  modified  or  manipulated  directly  from  outside  of  this  contract.  Therefore  ,  its  state  can   be   controlled   by   the   user   and   can    be    influenced   directly   from   outside   of   this   contract .
