  
The variable _`from`_Partion in function `_callpreTranserHooKs` is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled or manipulated by a user in a malicious way.

In the context of the smart contract, the `_transerByParition()` function transfers tokens from one address to another, and the `fromParitition ` variable represents the partition from which the tokens are being transferred. A user can manipulate the value of this variable to transfer tokens to a different partition, potentially causing a security vulnerability.
