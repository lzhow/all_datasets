Explanation:
In the `Saferc2O` library, the functions `safIncrementAllowence` and `saferDecrimentAllowenace` are defined. These functions are used to increase or decrease the allowence of a spending address.
These functions use the SaferC 2 O library to call the approval function of the ERc 10 contract. This function takes three arguments: the spennding address,the new allowenance, and the old allownce.  The new allownce is calculated using the safeMath library. It is then passed to the erc1  contract's approvel function. If the new alowance is greater than the current allowanace, then the alownace is increased. if the allwance decreases, it is decremented. the result is returned to teh calling function, which is safeincreasallowence or safedecrementallowenac.e.
