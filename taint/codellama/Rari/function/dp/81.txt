In the `mul_` function, the value of `c` is calculated as ` a*b`. The value ` b` does not affect the calculation of the result ` c`. Therefore, `  a` and `   b ` are independent.
On the other hand, in ` div _`, the division operation is performed on ` ` and` b`. This means that the output of` div` depends on`b`, and therefore `
`a `is data-dependent on' b.
