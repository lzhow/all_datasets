Explanation:
In the `updatePool` function, the `_token` variable is passed as an argument. This function calls the internal function `_updateToken` which updates the pool's total borrows and total borrow shares.
Then, it calls `setPool`, which sets the totalBorrrows of the token to the value of `_totalborrows` and the totaBowrrowshares to `_totaBrowrrows`.
Finally, `callAction` is called, which calls `_action` with the updated token.  `_Action ` is a function that calls` _updateInteres`t`with the current timestamp. `_UpdateInterst` updates  the interest rate of each token based on its totalborrws and totoBrownsharess. Therefore, `_interest` depends on `_borrowerShar`es, and therefore,`_rate`.
