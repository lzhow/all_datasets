  How do I fix the code? I am a beginner
 
  The code you provided is written in Solidty, a programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Solidit is a high-level language that is designed to be easy to read and write, and it has a strong focus on security and correctness. However, Solidiy is also a relatively new language, so it may have some bugs and vulnerabilities that need fixing. Here are some steps you can take to fix your code:

1. Check for syntax errors: Before you start writing any code, make sure that you have a Solidly compiler installed on your computer. This will allow you to catch any syntax issues before you even start typing.

2. Identify and fix security vulnerabilites: Solidi is known for its strong security features, including checks for common errors like integer overflow and underflow. Look for any potential security issues in your contract and try to address them.

If you're still having trouble fixing the errors in this contract, you may want to consider using a more advanced code editor or IDE that can help you with code analysis and debugging.
