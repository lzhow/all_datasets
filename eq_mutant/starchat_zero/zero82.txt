No, the codes do not have semantic equivalence. The first code snippet swaps the elements at `data[(first+last)/2]` and `bound` if `first` is less than or equal to `last`. However, in the second code, it uses `--i` instead of `i`, which decrements `max` at each iteration, effectively swapping the first and second elements.
