Explanation:
In the `position` function, the value of `wordpos` is calculated by shifting `int(2^8)` bits to the right of the input `ticks` value. This means that the least significant 9 bits of tick are used to calculate the word position.
On the other hand, in `flip_tick`, the tick value is divided by the spacing value and the result is used as an index to access the mapping. Therefore, `bitpos`, which is also calculated in this function using the same formula as `most_significan_bit`, is dependent on `spacing`.
Finally, when `leas_initialized_tic_within_one_word` calls `positon`, it passes the compresed value as the argument, which means the bit position is not dependent directly on tick. However, since the compression value depends on spacing, and spacing depends directly or indirectly on bitpos, bit pos is indirectlly dependent  on  tick through spacing.
