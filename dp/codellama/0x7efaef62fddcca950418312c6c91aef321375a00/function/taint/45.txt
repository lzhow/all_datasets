  
No, the ` blockTimestamplast` variable in function ` _ update` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a local variable and it doesn't have any user input.

The `update` function is called in `m int` and `burn` functions, and the local variables `balanc0`and ` balance  ` are passed as arguments. These variables are not user-controlled, so the value of `bloc kTimelast ` is also not under user control.
