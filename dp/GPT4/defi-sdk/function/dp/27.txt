Label: yes

Reason: The variable `amountsIn` in the function `getAmountsIn` is data dependent on the variable `pair` in the function `getReserves` because `amountsIn` is calculated based on the return value of the `getAmountIn` function, which is not shown in the provided code but can be inferred to use the `pair` variable as an argument. The `pair` variable is used to fetch reserve values from a UniswapV2Pair contract, which are then likely used to calculate the amount in (`getAmountIn`). Since `amountsIn` is directly affected by the output of `getAmountIn`, and `getAmountIn` presumably depends on the `pair` variable to fetch reserve values, there is a data dependency relationship between `amountsIn` and `pair`.
