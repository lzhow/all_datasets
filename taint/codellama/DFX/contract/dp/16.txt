Explanation:
In the `Curves` contract, the `_asset` variable is created as an array of addresses, and the first two elements of the array are set to the values of `_quoteAsset` and `_assimilationAsset`. The `_quotesAsset_` is a parameter of `NewCurv` function, which is passed as a function argument. Therefore, `_quotAsset _`is data-dependent on `_ baseCurrenc _`.
