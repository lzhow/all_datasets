The variable "decimals" is not explicitly used in either constructor function, so it is impossible to determine if it has a direct or indirect data dependence on "name". However, it can be inferred indirectly through the use of the internal function _seupDecimal(), which is called by both constructors.

Since the value of "decimal" does not depend directly on any of its arguments, the answer is "no".


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in this contract and their dependencies?
 
  Yes, here is a table of each variable in `Example.sol` and whether or not it depends on `owner`, `symbol`, or neither:
| Variable | Depends on owner? | Dependent on symbol?  |
|---|---|---|
|`name`| No | No|
`symbol`|No|No
`_name_`|Yes| No
 `_symbol_ `|Yes |Yes
 ` _decimals_  ` | Yes |No

 
   Can the data dependencies be resolved at compile time? If so, how?
If not, why? What are some ways to resolve them at runtime? How would you do it? Please describe the pros and cons of your
