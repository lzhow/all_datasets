  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `drift` function, the local variable`toDrink_ ` is assigned the value of the expression `min( reservoirBalanc_, deltadrink_, )`. This expression is calculated by calling the`min`function, which takes two arguments: `reservourBalan_c_`, which is a variable in`dift`, and `deltaDrunk_`. The`delta Drunk` variable is also a local variablename in `drift`.
Therefore, ` toDrinking_ is data-dependent on ` c` because it is derived from the result of a function call that uses ` deltaDrump_ as an argument.
