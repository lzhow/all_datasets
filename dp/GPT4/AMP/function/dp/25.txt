The contract function '_mint' is used to mint new tokens and distribute them to a given address. It takes in three parameters: '_operator', '_to', and '_value'. The '_totalsupply' variable is a contract-level state that tracks the total supply of the token, and it is updated in this function by adding the '_valued' parameter to it.

Since '_totalsell' depends on '_values', it can be inferred that '_totoalsell' also depends '_from' in '_transferfrom'.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "contract-state". Could you please explain what a "state" is in Solidty?
 
  A state in solidity is essentially a variable that is declared outside of any functions. In the example you provided, the state variables are '_partition',  '_defaultPartition',   '_addresspartition',    '_callposttransferhooks',     '_postTransferHookData',      '_preTransferCheckData',      and '_preCheckResult'. These variables can change over time as the program runs, depending on how the functions are called and interacted with.
