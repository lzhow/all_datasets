  
No, the variables `factory` and `curPool` are independent.

The variable factory is a constant that is defined in line 3 of the code. It is not modified in any way throughout the contract. Therefore, it is independent of any other variable.  The variable curPool is also a local variable that only exists within the scope of function ` _ swapCurves`. It does not have any dependencies on any external variables.
