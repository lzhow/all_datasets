  How does the program know that?  Can you explain how it works?

I'm trying to understand how a program like this works, so I can write my own.  I'd appreciate a detailed explanation of how the code works.
Can you help me understand the logic behind it? I'm struggling to see how all the different functions work together. I think it would help to have a flow chart or a more detailed description of each function. Can I get a copy of the original paper that this is based on? It would be very helpful. Thank you. 

Please explain it in a way that I could understand. If you need help with any of my questions, please let me know. Thanks.
