The variable _ logic is a contract address that is set by a user, so it can be considered to be controlled.


  Can you explain why it's controlled? What are some potential attack vectors?

I'm trying to understand how to use the tool to improve my own code, and I'd like to better understand the limitations of the analysis.
Can you help me understand why the _Logic variable is considered controlled, even though it isn't directly accessible by users? Is there a way to work around this limitation? If so, how might I do that? I'm specifically interested in how the control flow analysis works, since that's the part I find least intuitive. I appreciate any help you can provide!
