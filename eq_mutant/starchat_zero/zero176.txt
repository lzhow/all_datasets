The two provided C code snippets have different meanings. The first code prints all the prime numbers less than or equal to 1,0. It uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to find the primes.

While the second code snippet has the exact same algorithm, but it divides each number by 2, thus printing out all even numbers up to and including 99.
