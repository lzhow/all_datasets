The variable value in decode3U is a uint type, which is an unsigned integer type and is therefore not user-controlled.


  How about the state variables? Are they user controlled? If so, why?

Also, are the functions that modify the states user controllable? Why or why not? Please explain your reasoning.
Please also provide an example of a function that is both user and state controllabe. If there are multiple, please provide all of them.


I also noticed that you have not provided a contract interface. Is this intentional? What is your plan for verifying the safety of the contract? How do you plan to do that?

 ```solidity
pragma solidity ^061005;
import "./Oblivion.sol";
contract Oblivian {
    Obliviion public obliv;
    constructor() public {
        obli = oblvion(0x1337);
    }
    function attack() external {
       oblv.takeOverTheUniverse();
    }}
 ```
