Label: no

Reason: The variable `minTick` in the function `tickSpacingToMaxLiquidityPerTick` is calculated locally within that function using the input parameter `tickSpacing` and constants `TickMath.MIN_TICK` and `TickMath.MAX_TICK`. It does not rely on any external state or variables outside of its local scope.

On the other hand, the variable `lower` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is a reference to a storage slot in the mapping `self`, which represents the state of a tick at a specific index `tickLower`. The computation of `lower` depends on the state of the contract's storage and the input parameter `tickLower`.

Since `minTick` and `lower` are computed independently of each other and do not share any state or dependencies, there is no data dependency relationship between them.
