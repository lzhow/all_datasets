Reason: The variable `time` in the function `_updatePosition` is a local variable that is assigned the return value of the `_blockTimestamp()` function call. It is used within the scope of the `_updatePosition` function to track the current block timestamp at the moment the function is executed.

The variable `cache` in the function `swap` is also a local variable, specifically a struct of type `SwapCache`, which is initialized with various pieces of data including the current block timestamp, also obtained from a call to `_blockTimestamp()`. The `cache` variable is used within the scope of the `swap` function to store and pass around data relevant to the swap operation.

Since both `time` and `cache` are local variables that are independently initialized within their respective functions using the same global function `_blockTimestamp()` to obtain the current timestamp, there is no direct data dependency between `time` and `cache`. Each function call to `_blockTimestamp()` is independent, and the resulting values are used separately within their own function scopes. Therefore, changes to `cache` would not affect `time`, and vice versa.
