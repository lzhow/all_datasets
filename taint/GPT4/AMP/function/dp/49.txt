The contract variable _indexOfPartition is not used in this function, so it is unknown whether or not it has a dependency on _partitionData.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand your answer. Could you please rephrase your question and provide an example of how the data dependencies would be determined in your example?
 
  The data dependence relationship between two contract variables is determined by analyzing the code of the smart contract. In the example provided, the _indexofTotalPartition variable is a contract-level state variable that is used to track the number of partitions in a partitioned token contract, and the partitionData variable represents the list of all partitions.

In the context of this specific function in our example, it can be seen that the transferByDefault function is responsible for transferring tokens between accounts. This function takes in several parameters, including the from address, to address and value to be transferred. Additionally, this transfer function also takes a _Data parameter, which is essentially a byte array that can contain additional information about the transaction. 

However, in order to determine the dependency relationships between these variables, we need to analyze how these parameters are used within the body of our function. Specifically, when it
