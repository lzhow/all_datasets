   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  
An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to the server during development. This is achieved by bundl[ing] together all the files that are required to render a web page, including JavaScript files, CSS files and images, into a single file that can be served to a user's browser.

The incremental part of the bundlers job is to only update the portions of code that have changed since the last time the bundle was generated. For example, if a developer has made a change to their JavaScript code, the incremental tool will only include the changed code in subsequent bundle files. Similarly, for CSS and image files the tool only updates the corresponding portions that changed.
