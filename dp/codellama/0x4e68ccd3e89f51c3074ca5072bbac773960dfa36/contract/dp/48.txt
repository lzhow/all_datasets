The variable target in function  binary search is not dependent on variable seconds ago in observe single. This is because the target variable is calculated based on time and target.  The secondsago variable in  observe Single is used to calculate the observation time delta. However, the time variable used in binary Search is time. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
