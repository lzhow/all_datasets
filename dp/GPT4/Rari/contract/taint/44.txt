Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `symbol_` in the function constructor is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the constructor, but the value of `symbol_` is determined by the contract creator or the entity deploying the contract. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user. However, without further context or information about how the value of `symbol_` is obtained, it is not possible to definitively classify it as either controlled or not controlled by the user. Hence, the label is "unknown".
