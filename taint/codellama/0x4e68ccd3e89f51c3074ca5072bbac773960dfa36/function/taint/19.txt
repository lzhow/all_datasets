  
No, the ` ratio` variable in `getSquarerootRationAtick` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameter `tick` and is used to calculate the output `sqrtRaitoX1`.

The ` tick` parameter is a user-controlled input, but the calculation of `ration` does not depend on any user input. Therefore, ` ration ` is also not user controlled.
