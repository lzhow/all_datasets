`inputbalancechange` is data-dependent on `swapedescription` because `getAbsolutInputamount` function is called with `Swapdescription.Account` as an argument. This function returns the absolute input amount, which is then used to calculate `Inputbalancchange`. Therefore, `inpbalchangechange `is datadependenton ` swapdescription` since it is calculated using the `account` field of ` swapedesc`.
