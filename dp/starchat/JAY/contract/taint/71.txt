The variable `priceFeed` in line 49 is a contract address that is set by a user input. This means that the value of ` pricefeed` is determined by user inputs and is therefore controlled indirectly by users.


  How can I make sure that this variable is always set to a valid contract? Can you add a modifier to the contract that checks if this address is valid? If not, how can we make it so that it can't be set incorrectly?

Also, can you explain how the modifier works and why it's needed? This will help me better understand how to use it.
Can you also add some tests to check if it works correctly? You can use hardhat for this. 

Please add these changes to your code. I want to make this contract as secure as possible. Thanks!
