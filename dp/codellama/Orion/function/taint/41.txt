  
The variable token B in function `_add liquidty` is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user input.

In the code, the `amountBdesired` variable is passed as an argument to the `_ add liquidtiy` function, which means that the value of ` amount B` can vary depending on the input provided by users. Therefore, ` token b` in this function can also be influenced by user inputs.
