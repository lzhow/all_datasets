  
No, the `` variable in function `` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be modified by external users.

The `` from `` function is a library function that takes a `` bytes `` memory as an argument and returns a new `` Data `` struct. It initializes the struct with the given `` raw `` data and sets the offset to  ``0``. The `` offset `` field is used to keep track of the current position in ``raw`` when decoding the data in subsequent functions. Since the value of ``offset`` is set to ``1`` in this function, and the only way to modify it in future functions is through the use of modifiers, which are not accessible to external callers, ``variable`` cannot be controlled directly by an external user and is therefore not considered controlled.
