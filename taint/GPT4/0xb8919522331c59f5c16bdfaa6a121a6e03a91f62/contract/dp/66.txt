Reason: The contract state `_ROLLBACK_SLOT` is a constant bytes32 value that represents a specific storage slot in the contract. It is used to store a boolean value indicating whether a rollback is being tested in the `_upgradeToAndCallSecure` function. On the other hand, the variable `admin_` in the function `admin` is a local variable that is assigned the return value of the `_getAdmin()` function, which retrieves the admin address from a different, specific storage slot denoted by `_ADMIN_SLOT`.

There is no code in the provided Solidity contract that shows a direct assignment or any computational dependency between `_ROLLBACK_SLOT` and `admin_`. They are independent storage slots and are used for different purposes within the contract. Therefore, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
