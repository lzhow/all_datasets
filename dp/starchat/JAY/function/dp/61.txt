The contract function 'buyNayERC20' has a loop that transfers NFTs from the sender to the smart contract. This loop depends on two inputs: the address of the NTF contract and the list of Nft IDs.

In the case where the two lists are of different lengths, the loop will fail and revert. In the event of a revert, any Nfts that were transferred will be returned to their original owners. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the sellNtfFee is data-dependent on 'ids' in this case.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me?
  
  Data dependence is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value depends upon another. For example, if a variable 'x' depends directly on another variable, 'y', then we say that'x'is dependent on y. If'y'changes, then''X'will also change. Data-independent variables are variables that do not depend on any other variables.

  In this context, data dependences are used to analyze how variables in a program relate to each other
