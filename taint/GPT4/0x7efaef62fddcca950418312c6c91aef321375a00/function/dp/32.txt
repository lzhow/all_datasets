Reason: The variable `balance1` in the function `_update` is directly assigned the value of the variable `balance1` from the function `swap` when `_update` is called. The line `_update(balance0, balance1, _reserve0, _reserve1);` in the `swap` function passes the current value of `balance1` as an argument to `_update`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `balance1` in `swap` and `balance1` in `_update`, as the latter depends on the value calculated and passed by the former.
