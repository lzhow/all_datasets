Reason: The variable `amount1Out` is used to determine the amount of token1 that is being transferred out of the contract to the address `to`. It is also used in the calculation of `amount1In` and in the validation of liquidity (`require(amount0Out < _reserve0 && amount1Out < _reserve1, 'Pancake: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');`). However, `balance0Adjusted` is calculated independently from `amount1Out`. The calculation of `balance0Adjusted` involves `balance0`, `amount0In`, and some constants, but it does not include `amount1Out` in any way. Therefore, `balance0Adjusted` does not have a data dependency on `amount1Out`. The two variables are related to different assets and their calculations do not intersect.
