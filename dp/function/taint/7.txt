  
No, the ` data` variable in function `_becomImplemenation` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function argument.

The ` _becameImplementaion` function is called by another contract, and the data argument is passed to it. Therefore, this data is coming from an external source and is under the control of the other contract.
