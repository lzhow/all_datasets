Reason: The variable `flippedUpper` in the function `_updatePosition` is determined by the outcome of the `ticks.update` function call within the same `_updatePosition` function. It is a local variable and its value is based on the parameters passed to `ticks.update`, which are derived from the function's arguments and other local variables within `_updatePosition`.

On the other hand, the variable `amountSpecified` in the function `swap` is a parameter of the `swap` function and is used within the context of that function to perform a token swap operation. It affects the swap logic and the state changes related to the swap, but it does not have a direct relationship with the `_updatePosition` function or the `flippedUpper` variable.

Since there is no direct code path or shared state that would cause `amountSpecified` to influence the value of `flippedUpper`, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
