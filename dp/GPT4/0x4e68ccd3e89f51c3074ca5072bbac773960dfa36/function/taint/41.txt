Label: no

Reason: The variable `log_sqrt10001` is calculated within the function `getTickAtSqrtRatio` based on the constant `sqrtPriceX96` which is an input to the function. However, the calculation of `log_sqrt10001` does not directly depend on any user input; it is derived from mathematical operations and constants defined within the contract. The user does not have control over the internal computation of `log_sqrt10001` once `sqrtPriceX96` is provided. The value of `sqrtPriceX96` might be influenced by the user, but the calculation of `log_sqrt10001` itself is determined by the contract's logic and is not directly set or modified by the user.
