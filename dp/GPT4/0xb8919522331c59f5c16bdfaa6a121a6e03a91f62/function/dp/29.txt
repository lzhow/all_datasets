  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `delegateCall` function is called on `address target` with `bytes` memory `data` as arguments. This function returns a tuple of two values: `bool` `success` and `memory` bytes `returnData`. The `require` statement checks if the target is a contract address, and if it is not, it throws an error.
Since the return data is dependent on both the success and the data, we can say that the retunData is data-dependent on target and data.
