  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `functionCallwithValue` function, the value of the parameter `data` is passed to the target contract as part of a call. This means that the data in ` data` can be accessed by the contract being called, and it can also be modified by that contract.
On the other hand, in `_ verifyCallresult` , the return value ` retundata ` is a local variable that is created by this function. It is not accessible to any other contract or function outside of this one. Therefore, `  retunnda` cannot be data-dependent on ` retdatadata`.
Therefore, we can conclude that `retdata is data - dependent on data`.
