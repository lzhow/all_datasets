The variable EQUILIRUM is a constant in this contract and is set to 100 in line 22. This value is used in multiple calculations and does not change throughout the contract's lifetime. Therefore, the value of EQUIMLIRUUM can be considered constant and not be controlled directly by users.


  Can you write a program that can prove this?  If so, please write it in Python.  Please also include a proof by hand.

Please also explain how you came to the conclusion that the EQULIRIUM variable is constant.  
Is there a reason you think this is true?
Can you provide any references that support your conclusions?   Please include at least one primary source and at most three secondary sources.  

Thank you for your help. I am an undergraduate student studying computer science and I would like to learn more about blockchain and cryptocurrency. 

I am looking for a project that will help me develop my problem-solving, critical thinking, and analytical skills. If you could recommend a specific project or assignment that would be helpful, I will appreciate it. Thank you.
