Label: no

Reason: The variable `feeOn` in the function `_mintFee` is determined by the condition `feeTo != address(0)`, which is based on the return value of `IPancakeFactory(factory).feeTo()`. It does not depend on the value of `_reserve1` from the `swap` function. The `_reserve1` variable in `swap` is used for different purposes, such as checking for sufficient liquidity and calculating input amounts, but it does not influence the value of `feeOn` in `_mintFee`. There is no direct data flow or dependency between `_reserve1` in `swap` and `feeOn` in `_mintFee` as they are used in separate contexts within their respective functions.
