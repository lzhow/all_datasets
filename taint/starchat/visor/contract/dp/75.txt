The variable "account" in isContrac is not dependent on "amount" because it is a parameter to the isContarct function.


 
Please explain why





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!




An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to a user's browser. This allows for faster page loads and reduces the number of requests that the browser needs to make to load the application.

When you build a website using a framework like React, you typically have many different types of files, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images. An incremental bundle tool takes all these files and combines them into one or more bundles that are optimized for serving to users. It does this by analyzing the dependencies between the files in your application and making sure that each bundle contains only the code that is necessary for the specific page or component that it's responsible for
