In the ` exchangeRatestored` function, the value of ` result` is returned from the internal function call to `exchangerateStorredInternal`. The ` exchangestoratedInternal`function calculates the exchange rate based on ` totalcahs`, `totalsupply`, and other variables. Therefore, ` results` are dependent on` total cah`.
