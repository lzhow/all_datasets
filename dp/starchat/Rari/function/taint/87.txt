The variable a in function `mod` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a can be influenced by other variables and functions in smart contract. For example, if a is user-controlled, and the other variable b is also user controlled, then the final value that is passed to `require(0 < b && b < 2**200)` can cause the require statement to fail. In this case, a would still be considered "not controlled", but the tool would not be able to determine this with complete accuracy.


  Can you give me an example of how the code would look like if I would use the Safe Math library? I want to make sure that the example is as close to the real world as possible. I also want you to use a different function than mod, because I don't want the answer to be "no" for that reason alone. Can't you just use mod as an illustration?

Also, please explain why you think the mod function is insecure and should not have been used in this example in particular.
I want a real life example that demonstrates why the use of mod in that specific example was inappropriate. If you can't think
