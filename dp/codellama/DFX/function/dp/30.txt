  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `alpha_`, `beta_ `, `delta_  `and `lambda_   ` variables are assigned values based on ` curve` . Therefore, these variables depend on  the  variable  curve  .
Similarly, in  function  view  Curve  , the variables  alpha  _ , beta  _, delta  and epsil  on are also assigned  values  based  upon  variables curve . Hence,  these  two  functions  have  a  data  dependency  relationship  between  them.
