Explanation: The variable `tokenB` in the function `getReserves` is data dependent on the variable `reserveA` in the same function. This is because the value of `tokenB` is used in the `pairFor` function, which is called to retrieve the reserves. The result of the `pairFor` function call is then used to assign values to `reserveA` and `reserveB`. Therefore, the value of `tokenB` affects the values of `reserveA` and `reserveB`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
