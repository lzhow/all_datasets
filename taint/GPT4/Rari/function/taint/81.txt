The variable `scalar` in the function `mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `scalar` is a function parameter and its value is passed as an argument when the function is called. The value of `scalar` is determined by the caller of the function and not controlled by the user within the contract.
