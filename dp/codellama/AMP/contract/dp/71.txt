  
No, the variables ` lastvalue` and `_ tokenHolder ` are independent.

The variable` last value` is a local variable in function` _ removeTokenfrompartition` that is used to store the last element of the array `_ partitionsof [ _ tokenholder]`. This variable is not dependent on any other variable or function in this contract.  On the other hand, variable _`tokenholder`is a parameter of function_`_ isoperator`and is dependent variable. It is passed as an argument to the` interfaceaddr` function, which is called in` `_ is operator` to check if the address of a contract implements the `IAmp Tokens Recipien`t interface. However, this dependency is only in one direction, from` Iamp Tokes Recipen`to` token holder`, and not in both directions. Therefore, `token holder` does not depend on`last value`.
