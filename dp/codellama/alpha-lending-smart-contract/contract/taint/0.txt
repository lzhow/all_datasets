  
No, the `_amount` variable in function `m int` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function signature is `function mint ( address _ account , uint 2 5 6  _ amount ) external` and the parameter `_ amount`is passed by value. This means that the value of `_ account` cannot be controlled or manipulated by any user input. It is a fixed value that is passed to this function when it gets called. Therefore, `_ _ _`variable is under the control of the contract developer and not the end user, and it should be treated as such.
