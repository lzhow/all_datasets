The ` buy ERc 7 5 9` function is used to buy NFT tokens from the blockchain. It takes in an array of NF token addresses, an arrays of token IDs, and an amount of tokens to be bought. This function uses the SaferMath library to perform the calculations.  The function first checks if the total amount is greater than the minimum amount required to purchase the NTF tokens. If it is, it then checks the balance of Ether in its account and compares it to the amount needed to complete the purchase. Finally, if there is enough Ethereum in their account, then the tokens are transferred to their address.
