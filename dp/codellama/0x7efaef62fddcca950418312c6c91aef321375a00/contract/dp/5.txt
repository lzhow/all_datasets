  
No, the state variable reserve  is not dependent on balance  in function  swap.

The reason is that the value of reserve is updated in a separate function called _ update, which is called after the swap function. This function updates the reserve values based on changes in balance, but it does not directly depend on any specific variable. Therefore, when the balance changes, it will not affect the current value stored in reserve.
