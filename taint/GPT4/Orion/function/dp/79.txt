Reason: The variable `factory` in the function `getAmountInCurve` is not directly dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `getAmountsOut`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `amounts` in the code snippet provided. However, there might be an indirect data dependency between these variables if there are other parts of the code that connect them. Without further information about the complete code, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
