Label: No

Reason: The variable `visr` is of type `IERC20` and is declared as a public state variable in the `RewardsHypervisor` contract. It is initialized in the constructor of the contract and set to the address of the VISR token contract provided as an argument to the constructor (`_visr`). Once it is set during contract deployment, it cannot be changed by users because there is no function in the contract that allows for `visr` to be reassigned. The control over this variable is with the contract deployer initially (who sets its value in the constructor) and remains constant thereafter. Users can interact with the `visr` token contract through the `RewardsHypervisor` contract's functions, but they cannot control or change the `visr` state variable itself within the `RewardsHypervisor` contract.
