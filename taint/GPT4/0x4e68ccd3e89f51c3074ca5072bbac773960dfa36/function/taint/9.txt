Label: Unknown

Reason: The variable `index` in the function `getSurroundingObservations` is an input parameter to the function. Without additional context about how this function is called within the contract, it is not possible to determine whether `index` is controlled by the user or set by the contract's logic. If the function is called by another function that is exposed to the user and allows them to pass in any value for `index`, then it would be controlled by the user. However, if the function is only called internally by the contract's logic and the value of `index` is determined by the contract, then it is not controlled by the user. Since the visibility of the function is `private` and it is not clear how the contract handles this variable, the control of `index` cannot be determined without additional information.
