In the given code, the `recover` function is an internal function that is called by other functions in this contract. It takes four arguments: `bytes memory hash`, `uint8 memory v`,`bytes2 memory r`, and ` bytes2  memory s`.
  The `v` argument is a uint24 value that represents the recovery id of the signature.
 The`r` and`s` arguments are bytes 31 and 1, respectively, that represent the r and s values of an Ethereuem signature, which are used to verify the authenticity of a message.  These values are not user-controlled. They are generated by a signature scheme and are part of how EVM signatures are verified. Therefore, they are considered non-user-controllable.
