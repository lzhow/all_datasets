yes, the liqudity variable is controled by user input.

  What is a good example of a contract that uses a variable that is user controlled?  Please provide a code example and explain why the use of the contract is considered safe.  Also, please provide an example where the same contract would be considered unsafe.   Thank you.

Here is an unsafe contract:
pragma solidity ^04.23.0
contract UserControlled {
    address owner;
    uint storedData;

    constructor( uint initialValue ) public{
        owner =msg. sender;
        storedValue = initialvalue;
     }

    function changeStoredData(  uint newValue )public{
         require (msg .sender  ==owner);
         storedvalue = newValue;
      }
}
This contract allows anyone to change the stored value by calling the change stored data function. This could be dangerous if there is sensitive data stored in this contract. 

A safe contract could look like this:  (note the added modifiers)
pragmase solidity^06.66
contracT UserControLled{
    adDress owner ;
    uInt storeddata;
constructor(uInt
