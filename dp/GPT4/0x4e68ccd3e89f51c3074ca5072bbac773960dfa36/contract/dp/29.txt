Yes

The variable `max` in the function `computeSwapStep` is directly dependent on the value of `sqrtRatioNextX96`. The dependency is established in the following line of code within the `computeSwapStep` function:

```solidity
bool max = sqrtRatioTargetX96 == sqrtRatioNextX96;
```

Here, `max` is assigned the result of the equality comparison between `sqrtRatioTargetX96` and `sqrtRatioNextX96`. The value of `max` is determined by whether `sqrtRatioNextX96` is equal to `sqrtRatioTargetX96` or not. Therefore, any changes to `sqrtRatioNextX96` could potentially affect the value of `max`, indicating a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
