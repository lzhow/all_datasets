The variable _isControlled is used to determine if a variable is user controlled or not. In this case, the _variable isControlle is set to true if it's value is assigned by a user input, and false if not, or if assigned a value by another function.

In this example, we can see that the value of the `_isControled` is determined by whether the address of `_variable` equals the `msg` sender. If it does, then `_controlled` will be set as true, otherwise it will remain false.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it has something to do with the way the mapping is implemented. Can explain it in simple terms? Thanks. 

Also, can you please explain what the purpose of this code block is doing?
`if (controlled) _controlled = true; else _uncontrolled.push(_variable);`





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most user friendly syntax compared to other languages, but I am not sure if that is true.  Are there any good textbooks or courses
