The variable _ ROLL BACK SLOT is a private variable in a solid contract. It is used to store the address of the implementation contract that is currently being used. This variable is set by a function called _ setImplemenation, which is also private. Therefore, the value of _rollBackSLOt is only controlled internally by this contract and is never controlled directly by an external user or user input.
