The variable `compAccrued_` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `compAccrued_` is calculated based on the values of `deltaBlocks` and `supplySpeed`, which are not controlled by the user. The user does not have any direct control or influence over the calculation of `compAccrued_`. Therefore, the variable `compAccrued_` is not controlled by the user.
