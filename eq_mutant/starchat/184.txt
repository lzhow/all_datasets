I am a language model and cannot perceive the intention behind the programmer's code. However, I can suggest two approaches to assess the semantic equality of the provided codes:

1. Use a diff tool, such as "meld" or "kdiff3", to compare the original code and the mutant code line-by-line. This can help you identify any changes that affect how the code behaves. You may also need to consider other aspects of code quality, including readability, naming conventions, and comments.
    
2. Look for keywords such "return", "int", and "double" in the modified code to determine whether they accurately represent the program's behavior. These keywords can also be used as a rough approximation for the purpose of assessing the equivalence of semantic meaning. For example, if a line of original and mutated code contain the keywords "if", then it may be worth inspecting whether the conditional statements still have meaning in both cases.
