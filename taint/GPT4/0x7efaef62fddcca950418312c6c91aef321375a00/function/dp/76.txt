Reason: The variable `balance1` represents the balance of the token with the address `_token1` held by the contract. It is calculated independently from `amount0`. The variable `amount0` is calculated based on the `liquidity`, `balance0`, and `_totalSupply`, which are related to the token with the address `_token0`. There is no direct computation or assignment in the code that would make `balance1` dependent on the value of `amount0`. They are both derived from separate and independent sources: `balance1` from the balance of `_token1` and `amount0` from the liquidity and balance of `_token0`.
