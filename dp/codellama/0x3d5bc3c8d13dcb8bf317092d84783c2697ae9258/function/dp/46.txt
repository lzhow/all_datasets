  
No, the `accruteInterst` function does not depend on `reapyAmount`. The `borrows` variable in `acrruateInteres` is not the same as the one in`repayaBorrrow`.

The `totalborows` and `interesAcculated` variables in accrateInterset are calculated based on`borowIndex`and`cahsPriore`, which are also calculated in acrrateinterset.
On the other hand, `accountborros`in`reapyaBorgrow`is calculated by subtracting`actualrepamout`from`account borros`. This variable is also used in other functions, such as`accrateInsterest`, so it is possible that it depends on other variables. However, it does depend directly on repayaAmount.
