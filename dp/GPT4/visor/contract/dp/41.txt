Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the code size of the address `account` and is determined by the `extcodesize` opcode in the EVM, which is only related to the `account` parameter passed to the `isContract` function. On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionCallWithValue` represents the address of the contract being called with data and value. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `size` and `target` as they are used in different contexts within their respective functions and do not influence each other's values. The `size` variable is scoped to the `isContract` function and `target` is scoped to the `functionCallWithValue` function, and there is no data flow or shared state that would create a dependency between them.
