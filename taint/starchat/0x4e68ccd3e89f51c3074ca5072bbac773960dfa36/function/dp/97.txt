The variable 'tick' in function 'transform' is not dependent on'self' because it is a local variable and is only used within the scope of the 'if' statement.


  Can you explain why it's not?
 
  The variable "tick" is used in a multiplication operation, which is an operation that does not have any data dependencies on its inputs. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the value of "self" has any effect on "transform" or "observeSinge".
