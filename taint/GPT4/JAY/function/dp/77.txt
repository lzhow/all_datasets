Explanation: 

The variable `amounts` in the function `buyERC1155` is not directly dependent on the variable `id` in the function `onERC1155Received`. 

In the `buyERC1155` function, the `amounts` variable is used to calculate the `amount` variable, which is then returned. The `amounts` variable is used as an input to the `add` function, but it is not directly dependent on the `id` variable.

In the `onERC1155Received` function, the `id` variable is used as an input to the `onERC1155Received.selector` function, but it does not affect the `amounts` variable in the `buyERC1155` function.

Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the `amounts` variable in the `buyERC1155` function and the `id` variable in the `onERC1155Received` function.
