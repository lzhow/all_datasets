The contract state `_decimals` is data dependent on the variable `decimals_` in the function `_setupDecimals` because the value of `decimals_` is directly assigned to `_decimals` within the function body. This establishes a direct data dependency relationship where the state of `_decimals` is determined by the input `decimals_`.
