yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_originSwap` function calls the `getOriginswapdata` and `Curvemath. CalculateTrade` functions, which both use the value of `_ngliq`.


  Can you explain why it's data-dependent?
 
  The `_vieworiginswap` method calculates the amount of tokens that will be received by the user in exchange for the specified amount in `_origingamount`. This amount is calculated by calling the getoriginandtarget method, and the calculatetrade method.
