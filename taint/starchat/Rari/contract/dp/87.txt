The contract has a function called `_becomImplementation` that is called by the `_resgnImplementation`. The function has the signature `_becameImplementation (bytes)` and it is used to update the implementation of the smart contract.

In the body of `_prepare` function, the code checks if the `msgSender` is not equal to the address of this contract and if `autoImplementaion` flag is set in `ComptrolV2Storage` contract, it calls the latest `CEr22Delegate` and checks whether the current implementation is equal or not to it. If it's not, then it sets the new implementation.
