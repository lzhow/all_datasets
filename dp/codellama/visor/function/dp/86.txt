  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `newAllowence` variable is calculated by subtracting the value of `token` from the allowence of the current contract. This means that the new allowense is dependent on both the token and the spendee.
Similarly, in function two, ` newAllownce` is also calculated using the same formula, so it is data-dependent on ` token` and ` spendre`.
Therefore, both ` value`and ` spendere` are dependent variables in both functions.
