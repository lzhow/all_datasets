The variable `liquidity` in the function `burn` is data dependent on the variable `balance1` in the same function. This is because `liquidity` is used to calculate `amount1`, which is derived from `balance1` using the following line of code:

```solidity
amount1 = liquidity.mul(balance1) / _totalSupply;
```

Here, `liquidity` is multiplied by `balance1` and then divided by `_totalSupply` to determine the value of `amount1`. Since `liquidity` directly influences the calculation of `amount1` and `amount1` is derived from `balance1`, there is a data dependency relationship between `liquidity` and `balance1`.
