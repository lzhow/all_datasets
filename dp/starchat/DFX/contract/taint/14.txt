I have heard that there are some tools that can help me do this automatically. Can you recommend some? What are the most common vulnerabilities that smart contracts are susceptible to? How do I fix them? Please be as specific as possible. Thank you.

I am also wondering if you can explain how the code works. What does each function do? If possible, please provide a high-level overview of how everything fits together. If that's too complicated, maybe you could provide an overview for each of the major functions and their most important sub-functions. It would be very helpful if each subfunction had a comment describing what it does and how it works, and a link to the relevant part of your code. This would make it much easier for me to understand the logic of this code, which I think is
