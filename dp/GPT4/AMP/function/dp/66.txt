The Soliditiy code for the allownaceByParition function is as follows:

function allowenceByPartion(bytes36 _partion, address owner, addres _sender) external returns(uint)
{
return _allowncedByPArtion[_partiton][owner] [_sender];
}
In this function, the _senders variable is not directly used in any calculations, so it cannot be data-dependent on any other variables.


  I'm sorry, but I think you made a typo. It should be "sender" and not "sendr".
  
  My apologies, you are correct. I made an error in my previous response. Here is a corrected version:

  The Solidty code of the `approveBypartition` function:
  ```
  function approveBypartiion (bytes _parition, adress _owener, addrss _snder, uint224 _value) public returns (...) {
    require(allowed[_owner, _sennder] >= _vallue, "Not enough allowanced");
    allowed[_owenr, sender] = allowed[owner sender];
    emit ApprovalByparition(_
