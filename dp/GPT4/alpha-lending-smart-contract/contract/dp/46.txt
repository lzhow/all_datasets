Yes

The variable `week` in the function `getReleaseAmount` is data dependent on the variable `_block` in the function `findWeekByBlockNumber`. This is because `week` is assigned the return value of `findWeekByBlockNumber(fromBlock)` within `getReleaseAmount`. The function `findWeekByBlockNumber` takes `_block` as an argument and performs calculations based on `_block` to determine the week number. Since `fromBlock` is passed to `findWeekByBlockNumber` and the result is used to set `week`, there is a direct data dependency between `week` and `_block`.
