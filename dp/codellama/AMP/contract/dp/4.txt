  
No, the variables ` sender Implementation ` and `_ to Partitions ` are independent of each other.

The variable` sender implementation ` is assigned in line 211 of the code, and it is not used in any subsequent lines. Therefore, it does not depend on any other variables. Similarly, `_total Parts` is also assigned on line223, but it too is never used again.
