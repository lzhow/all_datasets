yes

The variable `amount1` in the function `mint` is data dependent on the variable `balance1` in the same function. This is because `amount1` is calculated using the value of `balance1` after it has been adjusted by subtracting `_reserve1`. The relevant line of code is:

```solidity
uint amount1 = balance1.sub(_reserve1);
```

Here, `amount1` is directly derived from `balance1` using the `sub` function from the `SafeMath` library, which subtracts `_reserve1` from `balance1`. Therefore, there is a clear data dependency relationship between `amount1` and `balance1`.
