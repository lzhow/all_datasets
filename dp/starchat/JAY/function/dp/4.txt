The contract has a function called sell that takes a uint value as an argument. It then checks if the value is greater than the minimum value, which is stored in a constant called MIN. If the condition is not met, the program throws an error.

If the check is passed, then the seller's balance is decreased by the amount of JayToken they want to sell, and the total supply of the token is reduced by that same amount. Then, 9% of their selling amount is transferred to the buyer in ether, using the JayaToETH function. 3% is sent to a developer wallet. Finally, an event is emitted to log the time and price of 0.01 ether in JYC.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it. I want advice on how best to progress in my career as a software engineer. What courses should I take? How much time should it take me? Should I focus on specific libraries or frameworks? What are some good ways to find jobs once I'm good enough?
