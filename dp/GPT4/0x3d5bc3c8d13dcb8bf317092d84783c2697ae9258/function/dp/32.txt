Label: unknown

Reason: The provided Solidity function `transferFrom` does not contain any direct reference to a contract state variable named `totalReserves`. The function's behavior is to call another function `transferTokens` with the parameters `msg.sender`, `src`, `dst`, and `amount`. Without the implementation details of `transferTokens` or the broader context of the contract, it is impossible to determine whether `totalReserves` is affected by or dependent on the `amount` variable. Since the relationship between `totalReserves` and `amount` cannot be inferred from the given code snippet, the label is 'unknown'.
