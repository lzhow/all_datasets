In the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` of the `SqrtPriceMath` library, the variable `denominator` is calculated based on the value of the variable `product`. Specifically, `denominator` is assigned the result of `numerator1 + product` when `add` is `true`. Since `product` is used in the calculation of `denominator`, there is a data dependency relationship between `denominator` and `product`.
