Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_owner` in the `Ownable` contract is initially set to the address of the user who deploys the contract, as seen in the constructor where `address msgSender = _msgSender(); _owner = msgSender;`. This means that the user who deploys the contract has control over the `_owner` variable initially. Furthermore, the contract provides a `transferOwnership` function that allows the current owner to transfer ownership to another user. This function can only be called by the current owner (as enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier), which means that the control of the `_owner` variable can be passed to another user at the discretion of the current owner. Therefore, the `_owner` variable is controlled by the user.
