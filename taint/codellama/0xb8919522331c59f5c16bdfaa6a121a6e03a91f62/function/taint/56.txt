In the provided code, the `_authorizedUpgrades` mapping is used to store the addresses of the contracts that are authorized to upgrade the current contract. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the address stored in `_adminSlot` is authorised to perform the upgrade. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the value of `_adminslot ` is user-controlled or not.
