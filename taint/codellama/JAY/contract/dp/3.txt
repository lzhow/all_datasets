  
No, the ` buy Nft Fee Jay ` contract variable is not dependent on ` price ` in ` update Fees ` because it is set directly to the result of ` ETHToJ AY ` function, which is a conversion of the Ether value to J A Y tokens.

The ` Price ` variable in this function is used to calculate the new ` sell NFT FEE E TH ` and ` Buy N F T F E E T H ` values, but it does not affect the value of` buy n ft fee jay `.
