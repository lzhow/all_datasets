Yes

The variable `_fromPartition` in the function `_transferByPartition` is used to determine the partition from which tokens are being transferred. It is directly used in several operations within the function, such as checking operator permissions, updating balances, and emitting events that include the partition information. The function's logic and the resulting state changes are dependent on the value of `_fromPartition`, which means there is a data dependency relationship between the use of `_fromPartition` and the operations performed in `_transferByPartition`.
