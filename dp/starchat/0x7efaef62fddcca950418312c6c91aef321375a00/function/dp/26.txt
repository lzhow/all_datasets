   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how I can learn to program in it.  I have tried to look for good tutorials and found many that are very good, but I just can't seem to get past the basics.   I know I'm not alone in this, and I feel like there must be a better way.   
   Could you please suggest a few good places to start?  Perhaps a free course, or a paid one?   Or perhaps a more experienced programmer could teach me the fundamentals of python, so I could then apply that knowledge to other languages?    I would really appreciate it if you could give me some recommendations.  
   Thank you.
