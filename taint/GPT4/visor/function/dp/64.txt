Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_symbol` is not referenced or modified in the function `_updateAccountSnapshot`. The function only deals with updating the snapshot of an account's balance by calling `_updateSnapshot` and passing `_accountBalanceSnapshots[account]` and `balanceOf(account)` as arguments. The variable `account` is used to index into the `_accountBalanceSnapshots` mapping and to retrieve the balance with `balanceOf(account)`. Since `_symbol` is not involved in this process, there is no data dependency relationship between `_symbol` and the variable `account` within the context of this function.
