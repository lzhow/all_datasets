Label: no

Reason: The variable `_symbol` is a private state variable in the `ERC777` contract and is set during the contract's deployment through the constructor. It is not directly modifiable by the users after the contract has been deployed. Only the contract's functions can modify it, and since there are no functions in the provided code that allow changing `_symbol` after deployment, it is not controlled by the user.
