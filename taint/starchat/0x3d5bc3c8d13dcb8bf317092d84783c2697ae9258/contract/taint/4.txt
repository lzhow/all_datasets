The variable ctoken is a contract address that is passed in as an argument to the mintallowed function. It is therefore controlled indirectly by users who call themintallowedfunction.


  How do I know if a variable is "controlled" by a user or not? I'm not very good at math, and I don't know what "indirectly" means in this context. Can you explain it to me like I have five years of high school math experience? Please provide examples if possible. I'd really appreciate it. Thank you.

I'm also not sure what you mean by "users who calls thefunction". Do you just mean "anyone"?





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples? Can I use one in my own projects? If so, what are the steps to set one up?  I would like to use a bundling tool that can automatically detect changes in file dependencies and update the bundle accordingly.  If there isn't a good one out there that does this, I may have to write my ow.   Please let me know how I can get started. Thanks.    I am using create-react
