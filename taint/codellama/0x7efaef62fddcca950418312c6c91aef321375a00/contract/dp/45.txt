  
No, the variables ` amount  ` and `_ total Supply ` are independent in function` burn`.

The variable` amount ` is calculated based on ` liquid `, which is a local variable in ` burn ` that is not dependent on `_` total `Supplies`. The variable  `_ ` total` Supplies` is also a private variable of the contract and is only used to calculate the amount of tokens to be burned, but it is never used directly to determine the value of ` `  amount`. Therefore, ` _ `total`Suppl`ies` and ` amoun`t` are unrelated.
