Reason: The variable `oldPendingAdmin` in the function `_setPendingAdmin` is used to store the current state of `pendingAdmin` before it gets updated to a new value. This variable is solely dependent on the state of `pendingAdmin` and is used to emit an event for logging purposes.

On the other hand, the variable `cToken` in the function `_setCompSupplySpeed` refers to a CToken contract address that is being passed as an argument to set the supply speed for that particular market. The operations performed with `cToken` in `_setCompSupplySpeed` are related to updating the supply speed and the supply state of the market associated with that CToken.

There is no direct or indirect relationship between `oldPendingAdmin` and `cToken` as they are used in completely different contexts within the contract. `oldPendingAdmin` is related to the administrative control of the contract, while `cToken` is related to the financial logic of the rewards distribution system. Therefore, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
