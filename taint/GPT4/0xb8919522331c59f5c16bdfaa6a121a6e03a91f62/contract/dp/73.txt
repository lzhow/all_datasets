Label: no

Reason: The variable `target` in the function `functionCallWithValue` and the unnamed variable (presumably meant to be `target` as well) in the function `functionDelegateCall` are parameters of their respective functions. In Solidity, function parameters are scoped to their own function and are not shared between functions unless passed explicitly. Since there is no code in the provided snippet that passes the `target` from `functionCallWithValue` to `functionDelegateCall`, there is no data dependency between these two variables. Each function call operates independently with its own set of parameters, and the state of one does not affect the other.
