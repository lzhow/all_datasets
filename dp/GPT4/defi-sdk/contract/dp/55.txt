Reason: The variable `weth` in the constructor is used to initialize the state of the contract by setting the address of the WETH token, which is a wrapped version of Ether to allow it to be traded like an ERC20 token. This address is set once during contract deployment and does not change throughout the contract's lifecycle.

On the other hand, the variable `token` in the function `callBytes` is a local variable that is assigned a value based on the first pair's token0 or token1, depending on the direction of the swap. This value is determined during the execution of the `callBytes` function and is independent of the `weth` variable set in the constructor.

Since the value of `token` is not influenced by the value of `weth` and vice versa, there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables. They are used in different contexts within the contract for different purposes.
