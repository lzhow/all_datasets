Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. For example, Python supports an exception-handling mechanism that is cleaner than that of C++ or Java. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. This feature allows programmers to write code that's more concise and easier to maintain. Additionally, it allows for rapid development, with many available libraries and frameworks that can be used for various purposes. However, this
