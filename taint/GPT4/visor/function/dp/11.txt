Label: yes

Reason: The variable `success` is determined by the outcome of the `target.call{ value: value }(data)` operation. Since `target` is the address on which the call is being performed, the success of this call operation is directly dependent on the `target` variable. If `target` is not a contract or the contract at `target` does not function correctly, or the function called within the contract does not exist or fails for any reason, it will affect the value of `success`. Therefore, `success` is data dependent on `target`.
