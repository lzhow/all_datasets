Reason: The contract state `_nonces` is a mapping that keeps track of the number of times the `permit` function has been used by a particular address. It is incremented in the `permit` function to prevent replay attacks. On the other hand, the variable `amount` in the function `_beforeTokenTransfer` represents the number of tokens being transferred. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `_nonces` and `amount` within the provided code. The `_nonces` mapping is only modified in the context of the `permit` function, and `amount` is not used in that context. Therefore, `_nonces` and `amount` are not data dependent.
