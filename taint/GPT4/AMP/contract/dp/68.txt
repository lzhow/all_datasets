Reason: The variable `_prefix` in the function `setPartitionStrategy` is used to set a partition strategy for a specific partition prefix and is not influenced by or dependent on the state of any particular token holder. It is used to manage the mapping `_isPartitionStrategy`, which is a mapping from a bytes4 prefix to a boolean indicating whether that prefix is a registered partition strategy.

On the other hand, the variable `_tokenHolder` in the function `_isOperator` is used to check if a given address `_operator` is an authorized operator for the specified `_tokenHolder`. This check is performed against the mapping `_authorizedOperator`, which maps token holder addresses to their authorized operators.

Since `_prefix` and `_tokenHolder` operate on different state variables and have no code paths that lead to one affecting the other, there is no data dependency relationship between them.
