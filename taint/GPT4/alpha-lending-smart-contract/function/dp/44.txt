Label: no

Reason: The variable `pool` in the function `repayInternal` is not data dependent on the variable `pending` in the function `calculateAlphaReward`. In the given code, `pool` is a storage pointer to a struct in the `pools` mapping, which is indexed by the address of the `_token`. The variable `pending` in `calculateAlphaReward` is a local variable that calculates a value based on the difference between `pool.alphaMultiplier` and `userData.latestAlphaMultiplier`, multiplied by `userData.borrowShares`, and then divided by a constant. 

The calculation of `pending` does not affect the state of `pool` in any way; it is a read-only operation that does not modify any state variables. The `pool` variable's state is only modified within the `repayInternal` function, where it updates `pool.totalBorrows` and `pool.totalBorrowShares`. Since there is no write dependency from `pending` to `pool`, and `pending`'s value is derived without causing any side effects to `pool`, they are not data dependent.
