  
No, the variables `_amout` and `_poo` are independent.

The variable ` _amont` is assigned the value of the `wanted` token balance of `msg` sender. This value is independent of `_ pool` as it is obtained from a different source.  `_Pool` on other hand is calculated by calling the balance function of want and subtracting the amount of tokens that have been deposited into the strategy contract. Therefore, `_ amount` does not depend on `_ poo`.
