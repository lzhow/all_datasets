  
The label is 'No'.

Explanation:
In the `Address` library, the functions `sendValue`, `call`, and `delegateCall` are used to interact with other contracts. These functions take in a `recipient` address and a value to be transferred. However, in `address.sol`, the variables `sender` and` recipients` do not have any data dependencies.
Therefore, `Value` is not dependent on `Target` because they do no share any common data.
