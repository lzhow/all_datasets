  
No, the `granuarity` variable is a constant and is set to  `1` in this contract. It is therefore not user-controlled.

The `using SaferMath` statement is used to import the SafterMath library, which provides a set of functions for performing safe mathematical operations. These functions are used throughout the contract to prevent integer overflows and underflows. However, they do not affect the value of the granuarlity variable, as it has already been set.
