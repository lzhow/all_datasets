  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getProxyImplentation` function, the expression `address( proxy ).staticCall( hex" 5 c 6 0 da 1 b " )` is evaluated, which calls the static `staticCal`l function on ` proxy` with the argument `hex " 7 8 9 a b c d e f "`. This function call is made using the low-level `call` mechanism, and the return value is stored in a tuple of type `(bool,bytes)`.
Since the call to ` staticCall` does not modify the state of `Proxy`, it is a read-only operation, so the data dependence is not modified.
On the other hand, in ` upgradeandCall`, the proxy is modified by calling the` upgradeToandCalL` method on it with two arguments: the address of the new implementation and a bytes array. This method call modifies the storage of proxy, making it data-dependent on its previous state. Therefore, `yes`
