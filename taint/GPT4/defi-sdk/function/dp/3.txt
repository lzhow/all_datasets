Label: yes

Reason: The variable `amounts` in the function `callBytes` is directly assigned the return value of the function `getAmountsOut` or `getAmountsIn`, which produces the `amountsOut` array. The assignment is based on the condition `swapType == SwapType.FixedInputs`, which determines which function to call, but in both cases, the `amountsOut` array from `getAmountsOut` function is used to initialize `amounts`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `amounts` in `callBytes` and `amountsOut` in `getAmountsOut` because the value of `amounts` is derived from the value of `amountsOut`.
