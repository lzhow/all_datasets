Label: no

Reason: The variable `_from` in the function `_transferByPartition` and the variable `_tokenHolder` in the function `_isOperator` do not have a data dependency relationship. The variable `_from` represents the address from which tokens are being transferred in a particular partition transfer operation. On the other hand, `_tokenHolder` is a parameter in the `_isOperator` function that checks if a given address (`_operator`) is an authorized operator for the `_tokenHolder`. There is no direct assignment, computation, or logical connection in the code that would indicate a data flow from `_tokenHolder` to `_from` or vice versa. Each function operates independently with its own parameters, and the values of these parameters are determined by the caller of the function, not by each other.
