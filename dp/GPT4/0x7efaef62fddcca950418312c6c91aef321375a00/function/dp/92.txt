Reason: The variable `balance0` is defined within the `mint` function and is used to calculate the amount of token0 that will be minted as liquidity. It is calculated by subtracting `_reserve0` from the current balance of token0 held by the contract. The contract state `decimals` is not mentioned or used anywhere in the provided function, nor does the calculation of `balance0` depend on the `decimals` state. Since there is no interaction or dependency between `balance0` and `decimals` within the given code snippet, they are not data dependent.
