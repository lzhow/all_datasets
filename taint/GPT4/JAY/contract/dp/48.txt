The variable `_sellNftFeeEth` in the function `updateFees` is data dependent on the variable `price` in the same function. The reason for this is that `_sellNftFeeEth` is calculated based on the value of `price`, which is obtained from the `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` call. The calculation of `_sellNftFeeEth` involves a conditional check on `_price` (which is derived from `price`) to determine its value. Therefore, any changes to `price` will directly affect the computation and the resulting value of `_sellNftFeeEth`.
