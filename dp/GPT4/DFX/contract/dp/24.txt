Yes, the variable `deposits_` in the function `proportionalDeposit` is data dependent on the variable `_length` in the same function. 

Explanation: The variable `deposits_` is an array of type `uint256[]` with a length of `_length`, which is determined by the variable `_length` in the same function. Therefore, the value of `_length` directly affects the size of the `deposits_` array, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
