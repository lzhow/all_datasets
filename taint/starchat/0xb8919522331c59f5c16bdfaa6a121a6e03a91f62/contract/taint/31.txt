The variable _ BEACO_ SLOT is used to store the address of the beacons contract. This contract is responsible for storing the addresses of all the other contracts in our system. It is important to note that this contract can be upgraded by a user, but it should be done with caution as it can have significant consequences on the system as a whole.

In this case, the _beaconSlot variable is a bytes 3 2 variable, which is stored in storage. Storage is part of a larger data structure that is managed by Solidty. When we declare a variable as storage, Solidit automatically allocates a slot in memory to the data and keeps track of it. We can access the value of this variable using the storage keyword. For example:
`bytes 1 storage myVar = "a";`
This will allocate a single byte of storage and store a in it, and we can later access it using myvar.


  How can I upgrade the Beacn contract? Please give me an example
