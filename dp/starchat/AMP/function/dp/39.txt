The contract function `addtokenTopartition` is a private function that is called by other functions in this contract. It adds `_Value` to the balance of `_to` and adds the `_partition `to the list of partitions `_To` belongs to if it is not already in that list.

It also adds`_Value ` to `balanceOfbyPartition`_To`_Partition `and increments the total supply of the partition `_Partition`.
However, it does not update the `TotalSupplybypartition`_partition`. This means that the value of ` totalsupplybypartiton`_ partition` may be incorrect.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship." Could you please explain what that means?
 
  Data dependency is when one variable or state is dependent on another. In the context of your question, if the state totalSuppyByPartiton is data-dependent on variable _Value, then any change to _VAlue could affect the correctness of totalSuppplyByParition. If _Partition is also data dependant on _To, and _Balance is dependend on total Supply, the system would be more complicated to understand and debug.
