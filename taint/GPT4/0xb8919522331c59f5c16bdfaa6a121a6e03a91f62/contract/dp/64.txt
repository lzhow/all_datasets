Yes

The variable `success` in the function `getProxyAdmin` is used to determine whether the static call to the proxy contract was successful. The result of this call is necessary to decode the `returndata` and obtain the admin address. If the call is not successful, the function will revert and not return any value. Therefore, the variable that is returned by `getProxyAdmin` (the admin address) is data dependent on the `success` variable because the output is contingent on the successful execution of the static call. If `success` is false, the function will revert, and no admin address will be retrieved or returned.
