Label: no

Reason: The variable `exchangeRateMantissa` in the function `getAccountSnapshot` is assigned a value from the function `exchangeRateStoredInternal()`, which is not shown in the provided code snippet. However, based on the given code, there is no direct reference or use of the variable `result` from the function `borrowBalanceStoredInternal` in the calculation or assignment of `exchangeRateMantissa`. The two variables are updated independently within their respective functions, and there is no data flow from `result` to `exchangeRateMantissa` within the provided code. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
