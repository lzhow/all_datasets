  
The variable tamt is a local variable in function `originSwapp` and it's not directly controlled  by user input. It is calculated based on the input parameters of the `getOriginandTarget` function and the output of `Assililatros.OutputNumereire` which is also not user controlled. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In the code, `oAamt` is passed as an argument to `assilitators` `outputNumerire`, which means that the value of oamt will be controlled directly by `curves` state.
