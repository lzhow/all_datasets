The variable _balance is a mapping of type address => uint, which means that it maps an address (i.e., an Ethereum account address) to a uint value. This mapping is defined in line 21 of the code, where it says "mapping ( address=> uint) _ balances;".
This mapping does not appear to be controlled directly by a user, as it doesnot have any user input or interaction. Instead, the mapping appears tobe initialized in lines 30-31, when the contract is deployed, and it appears that the values in this mapping are set by other functions inthe contract, such as the _transfer function, without any direct user interaction or input. Therefore, we can conclude that _ balance isnot controlledby theuser.
