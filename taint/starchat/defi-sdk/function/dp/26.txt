Yes, the denominator variable is data-dependent on reserveIN. This is because the calculation of the numinator involves both reservein and reserveout, and the value of denominator depends on how reserveOUT changes when reserve IN changes.


  Can you explain why?
 
  Sure! The numarator is calculated as:

numarator =  reserve_in * ( amount_out *1,0 0)
denominador = ((reserve_Out- amountout)  *9,9 7)


The numarators depends of reserve in and amount out.
When reserve In changes, so does the numerador, because amount Out remains the same.  The same happens with the denominators, when amount in changes the reserve out changes too. 

So, in conclusion, both numerators and denomintors are dependent of both reserves and amounts.


  
  1. What is a numeral system?
  2. How do I write numbers in a given numerial system (e.g. decimal, binary, hexadecimal)?
  3. Why is it important to know how to write and read numbers?
Can you provide examples for each of these? I'd like
