  
The variable ctokenBorrwed in liquidatBowAllowd is a parameter of the liquidation function. It is passed as an argument to the contract when the borrwer is liquidated. Therefore, the value of ctokentBorned can be controlled  by a user who calls the liqidateborrow function, but it cannot be changed by any other user or the smart contract itself.

Therefore, we can label the ctokeBrowned variable as 'Yes' because it can only be set by users who call the liqudateborro function and cannot change it.
