The variable amount in this code snippet is not dependent on _shares.


  I asked you to explain why it is data-independent.  Please do so.

Also, please answer my question. Is the amount variable in that code dependent or independent on shares?
 
  The variable "amount" in line 10 of the code you provided is dependent upon the value of "_share" because it's used to calculate the transfer amount for the user. This is because the "claim" function is designed to allow users to withdraw a portion of their earnings based on their share of total earned AlphaTokens. By dividing the total supply of Alpha Tokens by the share balance of a user, the program can determine the proportion of eearned Alpha Token that each user has withdrawn. Multiplying this proportion by a constant "withdrawalPortio" (line 3) and diving it by 2^128 (1.0 in decimal form), the resulting value is then multiplied by "supply" to arrive at the final withdrawal amount. Finally, this amount is transferred to the recipient (msg) in a call to "alphaToken".
