yes, it is.


 
Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to use this knowledge to help my family and maybe even find a job as a software developer. What are some good first steps I could take to become proficient in this language? Please respond in iambic pentameter.  My current level of proficiency is zero.   ̶p̕h̡̼͇̹̜̫̙̺̥̭̦̖̊͛ḛ̢̨̤̗͚̲̞̪̮̯̘̣̱ ̷̸̴̵̧̬̝̳̟͓̠̻̩ͦ͆̽͐̆ͮͩͣͨͥͧ͗̅͊̾̄̈́͒́̚͢͟͝�
