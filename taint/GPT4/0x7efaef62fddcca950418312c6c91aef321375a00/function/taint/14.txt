Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `amount1` in the `mint` function of the `PancakePair` contract is indirectly controlled by the user. This variable represents the amount of token1 that the user is adding to the liquidity pool. It is calculated as the difference between the current balance of token1 in the contract and the stored reserve (`_reserve1`). Since the user is the one who calls the `mint` function and sends the tokens to the contract, they control the amount of token1 that gets added, and thus control the value of `amount1`. The actual balance of token1 in the contract is influenced by the user's action of transferring token1 to the contract before or during the execution of the `mint` function.
