Label: no

Reason: The variable `mathErr` in the function `transferTokens` is used to capture the result of mathematical operations within that function and is scoped locally to the `transferTokens` function. It is not influenced by or dependent on any external variables or state changes outside of its function scope.

On the other hand, the variable `borrowIndexNew` in the function `accrueInterest` is a result of calculations within the `accrueInterest` function and is scoped locally to that function. It is used to update the contract's state variable `borrowIndex`.

Since `mathErr` and `borrowIndexNew` are used within their respective functions and there is no direct interaction or dependency between these two functions as shown in the provided code snippet, there is no data dependency relationship between `mathErr` in `transferTokens` and `borrowIndexNew` in `accrueInterest`.
