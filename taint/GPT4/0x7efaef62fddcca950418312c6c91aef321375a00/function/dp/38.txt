Reason: The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is determined by the result of the `token.call` operation, which is a function call to an external contract. It is dependent on the `token` address, the `to` address, and the `value` being transferred. On the other hand, the variable `_reserve0` in the function `_mintFee` is a parameter of that function and is used to calculate liquidity fees within the `_mintFee` function. There is no direct relationship or data flow between `_reserve0` and the `success` variable in `_safeTransfer`. The two variables are used in separate functions for different purposes and do not influence each other's values. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
