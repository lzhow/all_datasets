The variable protocolFeDefault in setProtcolFeeDefualt is a struct that is defined in Structs, which is imported by ProtocolFe. It is then assigned to the protocolFeesDefault variable, and is therefore controlled indirectly by user input.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it has something to do with the ownership of the contract. Can the owner change the fee? If so, how? Can anyone change it? How does the signer work? What is it used for? Why is there a delimiter? And why does it start with a capital letter?
