Label: no

Reason: The contract state `alTokenDeployer` is not referenced or used in the function `giveAlphaToAlToken`. The function `giveAlphaToAlToken` interacts with the `pool` variable, which is a storage pointer to a struct in the `pools` mapping, and it uses the `distributor` to approve the `alphaToken` transfer to `pool.alToken`. However, there is no direct interaction or dependency between `alTokenDeployer` and `pool` within this function. The `alTokenDeployer` is used in the constructor to initialize the base `LendingPool` contract, but it is not involved in the `giveAlphaToAlToken` function logic. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `alTokenDeployer` and `pool` in the context of the `giveAlphaToAlToken` function.
