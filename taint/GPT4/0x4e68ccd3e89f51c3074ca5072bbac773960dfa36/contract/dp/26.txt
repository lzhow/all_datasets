Label: no

Reason: The variable `denominator` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` is not data dependent on the variable `amountOut` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput`. In the `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` function, `denominator` is calculated based on the variables `numerator1` and `product`, which are derived from `liquidity`, `amount`, and `sqrtPX96`. The `amountOut` variable is not used in the calculation of `denominator` within this function.

On the other hand, the `amountOut` variable is used in the `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput` function to determine the `sqrtQX96` value based on whether the trade is for token0 or token1 (indicated by the `zeroForOne` boolean). The `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput` function calls either `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` or `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` depending on the `zeroForOne` flag, but it passes `amountOut` as an argument only if the trade is for token1 (when `zeroForOne` is false). In the case of `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp`, the `amount` argument is not derived from `amountOut` but is used for a different purpose in the function's logic.

Therefore, since `denominator` in `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` does not rely on `amountOut` from `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput`, there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables.
