  
The label is 'No'.

In the ` calculate LinearInteres` function, the `_rate` variable is data-dependent on `_toTimestmap` and `_ fromTimestamp`. However, `_ toTimestamp ` is not dependent on ` total Liquidty` or ` _ from Timestamp` . Therefore, `  _ to Timest map` is independent of `Total Liqidy` , and the data dependence relationship between `_ rate`and ` Total Liqui` does not exist.
