Explanation: The variable `errorMessage` in the function `div` is not controlled by the user. It is a parameter of the function and is passed as an argument when the function is called. The value of `errorMessage` is determined by the caller of the function, not by the user interacting with the contract. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
