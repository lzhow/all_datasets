  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `tickCummulative` variable is calculated using the `_blockTimeStamp()` function. This function returns the current block timestamp, which is a global variable that is updated every time a new block is added to the blockchain. Therefore, `blocktimestamp` is data-dependent on `timestamp`.
Similarly, in function 2, `_feegrowthisGlobal` and `_fegowthisglobal` are calculated based on `_tick` which in turn is dependent on liquidtyDelta.
Therefore, both `timestamps` variables are dependent variables of `liqidtydelta`.
