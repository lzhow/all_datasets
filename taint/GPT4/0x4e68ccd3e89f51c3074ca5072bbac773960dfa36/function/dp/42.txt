Label: yes

Reason: The variable `targetAtOrAfter` in the function `binarySearch` is calculated based on the comparison between `time`, `beforeOrAt.blockTimestamp`, and `target`. The `target` variable within `binarySearch` is derived from the `target` parameter in the `observeSingle` function, where it is calculated as `time - secondsAgo`. Since `targetAtOrAfter` depends on the value of `target` and `target` in `observeSingle` directly influences the value of `target` in `binarySearch`, there is a data dependency relationship between `targetAtOrAfter` in `binarySearch` and `target` in `observeSingle`.
