  What is a merkletree?
 
  A Merkle tree is an efficient data structure used to store and verify the integrity of large data sets. It is composed of a hierarchy of hashes, where each level of the tree hashes the concatenation of its children. This allows for efficient verification of data integrity at each layer of depth in a Merkle tree.

In the context of blockchain technology, Merkel trees are used in many different applications, including:
- Proof of work (PoW) consensus algorithms, such as the Ethereum blockchain. In these algorithms nodes compete to solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the chain. To verify that a block is valid, the nodes must verify its proof ofwork, which is based on hashing the block header and comparing it to a target value. A valid block must also include a valid proof that it is part of an ordered chain of previous blocks, known as a blockchain, and that the proof-of-work is sufficient to meet the network's consensus rules. Merke trees help to ensure that this proof is computationally efficient and can be verified quickly.  Merkl
