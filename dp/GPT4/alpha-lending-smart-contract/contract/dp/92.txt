Reason: The variable `_amount` in the function `receiveAlpha` represents the amount of ALPHA tokens being received by the contract from the lending pool. It is used to calculate the new `alphaMultiplier` based on the total supply of the AlToken contract.

On the other hand, the variable `_account` in the function `claimCurrentAlphaRewardByOwner` represents the address of the account for which the current ALPHA reward is being claimed. This function internally calls `claimCurrentAlphaReward`, which calculates the pending ALPHA rewards for the `_account` based on the difference between the `alphaMultiplier` and the `latestAlphaMultiplier[_account]`.

The calculation of `_amount` in `receiveAlpha` is independent of the `_account` in `claimCurrentAlphaRewardByOwner`. The `_amount` is used to update a contract-wide state (`alphaMultiplier`), which could affect all users' rewards, but it does not directly depend on or is influenced by the `_account` variable. The two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes, and there is no direct data dependency between them.
