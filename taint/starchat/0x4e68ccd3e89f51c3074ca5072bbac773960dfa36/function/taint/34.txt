The variable self in function `update` is a mapping from int to TickInfo struct. This means that the keys of the mapping are controlled indirectly by tick. Therefore, the entire mapping is indirect control over the tick variable.


  Can you explain how the control flow of this code can be exploited by a malicious user to manipulate the state of a contract? Please provide an example of such an attack.

Please note that I am not a security expert and this is just an exercise in understanding how control-flow analysis can aid developers in preventing common vulnerabilities. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a more detailed explanation of how this attack would work, as well as potential countermeasures that could be put in place to prevent it. Thank you!
