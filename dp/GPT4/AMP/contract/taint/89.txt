The variable `granulariy` in function `grainularity` is **not** controlled directly by users. It is a constant that is used to define the smallest unit of the token.


  How can I make it so that it can be controlled? I want to be able to set the granularity to a value that the users can change. How would I do that? Can you give me an example of how to do it? Please explain it in detail. I am a beginner so please use simple words. Thank you.

I want the `Granularity()` function to return the value of `_granurality` which is currently set to  `1`.






   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?
A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, and L moves. J and P are the basic algorithms that can solve most of a cube, while L is often used as a twist to make the cube easier to solve. A J perm P LL algorithm can often be used in place of J or P to speed up the solving process. For example, a J' P' L' algorithm could be replaced
