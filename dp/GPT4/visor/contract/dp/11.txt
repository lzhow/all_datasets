Yes

The contract state `_decimals` is data dependent on the variable `decimals` in the function `constructor`. This is because in the `constructor` of the `vVISR` contract, the `_setupDecimals` function is called with `decimals` as its argument:

```solidity
_setupDecimals(decimals);
```

The `_setupDecimals` function is defined as:

```solidity
function _setupDecimals(uint8 decimals_) internal virtual {
    _decimals = decimals_;
}
```

Here, the internal state variable `_decimals` is directly assigned the value of the `decimals_` parameter, which is the `decimals` variable passed from the `constructor`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `_decimals` and `decimals`.
