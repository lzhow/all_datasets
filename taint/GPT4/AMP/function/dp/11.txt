The variable recipient implementation is not directly data-dependent on partition, but it is indirectly data dependendent via the partition variable.

When the contract calls the _isParitionStrategy function, it will check if the prefix of the provided partition is registered as a partition strategy. If it exists, the address of its corresponding strategy validator will be retrieved and assigned to the strategyImplementation variable, otherwise it defaults to address 0.


  How can I check the data dependencies of my own Solidty code?
 
  You can use a tool like Slither to check data flow in Soliditty. Sliter is a static analysis framework for Solidiity code that can be used to identify potential data vulnerabilities. It can also be use to find data and control dependencies in your code. 

Slither can help you identify data flows in a Solidiy smart contract by analyzing the code for potential vulnerabilites. This can include things like:
- Check if a variable is read before it's written to
 - Check for variables that are assigned a value but never read
This can provide you with a good starting point for further analysis. However, keep in mind that Slithr is still in early development and may not
