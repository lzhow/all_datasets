  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `Assimbators` library, the `_amt` variable in `function viewNumerairAmount` is data-dependent on `_amount` because it is passed as an argument to the internal function call `IAsimltr(_amount). viewnumerairAmount`. The internal call returns the value of `_numairAmt` which is then assigned to `_amnt`. Therefore, `_ammnt` depends on`_amount`.
