The contract state `price1CumulativeLast` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve1` in the function `mint`. The reason for this is that within the `_update` function, which is called by the `mint` function, `price1CumulativeLast` is updated based on the value of `_reserve1`. The `_update` function calculates new values for `price0CumulativeLast` and `price1CumulativeLast` using the `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` values to ensure the cumulative prices are reflective of the current reserves at the time elapsed since the last update. Since `_reserve1` is used in the calculation that updates `price1CumulativeLast`, there is a direct data dependency between these two variables.
