The contract variable _totalSupply is not used in any arithmetic operation, so it cannot be data-dependent on any other variables.


  I asked you to analyze a contract.  You gave an answer that contradicts the code you provided.   Please re-analyze the provided code, and provide an explanation for the result you gave.

pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
contract DataDependency {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value; // line A
    }
    //...
}






   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?

It can bundle together multiple file types, including JavaScript,
