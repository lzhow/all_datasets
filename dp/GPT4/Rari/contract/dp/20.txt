No. The contract state `compSupplyState` is not data dependent on the variable `newAccrued` in the function `updateContributorRewards`. 

Explanation: The function `updateContributorRewards` updates the `compAccrued` state variable based on the `newAccrued` variable, but it does not modify or access the `compSupplyState` variable. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `compSupplyState` and `newAccrued`.
