In the `balanceOf` function, the `_balaces[address]` variable is data-dependent on `address account` because it is used to retrieve the balance of the account.
However, in `trasnferfrom` the spending allowance is calculated using the current balance, which is dependent on both `from`, `to`, and `amount`.
Therefore, `account` is not directly dependent, but it indirectly depends on it.
