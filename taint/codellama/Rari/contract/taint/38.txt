  
No, the ` newpendingimplementation` variable in function `_setpPedingImplemenation` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function is called by another contract, and the parameter is passed to the contract. Therefore, this variable is under the control of the calling contract and not the end-user.
