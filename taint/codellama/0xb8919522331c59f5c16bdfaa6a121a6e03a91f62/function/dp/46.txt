In the ` functionfunctionCallwithValue` function, the` value` variable is passed as an argument to the target contract's `call` method. This means that the value of `value` is determined by the caller of the contract and is not dependent on any other variable in this contract.
On the other hand, in `FunctionDelegatecall`, the argument `data`is passed to `target. delegatecall`. This method does not take any arguments, so the data passed in is independent of any variable within the current contract, including ` success`.
Therefore, ` value ` and ` data ` are independent variables and do not have any data dependencies.
