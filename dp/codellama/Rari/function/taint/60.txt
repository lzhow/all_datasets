In the `mul_` function, the second parameter `a` is of type `Exp` and the third parameter is `uint`. The function returns an `exp` object.
Since the first parameter of the mul function ` a`is of `type Exp`, it means that the value of a is determined by a user input. Therefore, ` b` in this function can be controlled or influenced by user inputs.
