  
No, the ` success` variable in `buJJNoNF` is not dependent on `nfTs` in`getTotal`.

The ` getTotal` function returns the total number of NFT tokens bought and sold, and the` buyNoJN`function uses this function to calculate the amount of JN tokens to mint. However, this calculation is performed before the NF tokens are actually bought or sold. Therefore, ` buyNN` does not depend on` nfTS` for its calculation.
