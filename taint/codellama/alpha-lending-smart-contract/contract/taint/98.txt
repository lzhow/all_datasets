In the given code, the `getAssetPrince` function is a view function, which means that it does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, any variables used in this function are not modified by user input.
Moreover, in Solidiy, variables are immutable by default, so they cannot be modified after they are initialized.  Therefore the value of `mockPrcies` is fixed and cannot change.
