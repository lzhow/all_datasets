  
The variable _ balances is a mapping of addresses to uint 2 5 6 values. It is used to store the balance of each address in a contract.

In this case, the _ balance variable is set to a private mapping, which means that it can only be accessed by functions within the same contract or by derived contracts. This means the value of _ _  balancess is only controlled within this contract and not by any external user or user input. Therefore, we can label this variable as 'No' as it does not depend on any user inputs.
