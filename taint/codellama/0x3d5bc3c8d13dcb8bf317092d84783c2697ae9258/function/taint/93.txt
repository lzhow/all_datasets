  
No, the `` variable in get Exp is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be modified by any external user or function.

The variable is declared as a parameter of the get exp function, and its value is passed in when the method is called. Therefore, its scope is limited to the execution of that function and cannot be accessed or modified outside of it.
