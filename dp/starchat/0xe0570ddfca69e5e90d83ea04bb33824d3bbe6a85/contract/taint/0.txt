yes, the `_balance` variable is a mapping of the `address` type to `uint` and is therefore controlled.


  What is an example of a variable that is NOT controlled?

In computer programming, control flow is determined by a program's instructions, which specify what actions to take based on the current state of variables and data. Control flow statements allow programmers to control the order in which instructions are executed, and to change the flow of execution based upon certain conditions.
Control flow can be broadly categorized into two main types: sequential and selection. Sequential control flows are those in a procedural programming language in that the instructions in code are typically executed in order, one after the other. Selection control is used in programming to determine which code to execute based off of some condition. For example, if a certain variable equals a specific value then execute this code. In this case, selection control would be used. Another example is looping, where a block of code will continue to be executed until a condition is met. This is also selection based. A third example would the try-catch block in Java, in case an exception is thrown, then catch the exception and execute a different block, otherwise continue on. These are all examples
