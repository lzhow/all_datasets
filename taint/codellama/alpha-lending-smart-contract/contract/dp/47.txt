The variable 'data' in function 'shift' is not dependent on variable size in 'size' function. This is because the 'offset' variable in data is modified in each call to the shift function, and the size variable is only used to determine the number of bytes to shift. Therefore, the value of data remains the same throughout the execution of the contract, even if the offset variable changes.
