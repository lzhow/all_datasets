In the given code, the `ComptrollorV2Storage` contract is used to store the state of the smart contract. However, it is not clear from the code whether the storage contract has a dependency on `implementation` or `latestCetherDelegate`. Therefore, we cannot determine whether `AccruelBlocknumber` is data-dependent on`becomImplemenationData`.
