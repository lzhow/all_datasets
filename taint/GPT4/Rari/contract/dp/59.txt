Label: no

Reason: The variable `supplyIndex` in the function `distributeSupplierComp` is calculated based on the state of the `compSupplyState` mapping for a given `cToken`. It is not directly dependent on the `holders` variable from the `claimRewards` function. The `holders` variable is an array of addresses that is used to iterate through and call `distributeSupplierComp` for each holder, but the calculation of `supplyIndex` itself does not use or depend on the `holders` variable. The data dependency would exist between `supplyIndex` and the `compSupplyState` mapping, not between `supplyIndex` and `holders`.
