In the `function` buy Jay, the parameter `address[]` `callddata` erC 7 2 5 6 Token Address is passed to the internal function`buuJaYWithErC`1 9 4 8.
This function uses the`erc 3  _  t  o  k  e  n  A  d  D  R  E  S  s` variable to call the ERC-1958 token contract.  The`amount` parameter is used to transfer the amount of tokens from the caller to this contract using the safeTranserFrom function.   The `safeTranferfrom` function is called with the address of the token, which is `erC3_t_o_k_e_n_A_d_D_R_E_S_s`, the id of token to be transferred, and the number of units to transferred. This means that the value of ` er c  -  T  O  K  N  a  L  I  Z  i  m  P  r  V  M  C  Y  p  l  u  g  c _ t o k e n A d D R E S s ` is dependent on ` amount`.
