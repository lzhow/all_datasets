  
The label is 'No'.

In the `buyJeyNoNT` function, the local variable 'success' is assigned the result of the call to the 'dev' contract's 'call' function. This function call is not dependent on any variable in ` getTotal`s function because it is a separate function invocation.
On the other hand, in get Totals, there are two local variables, `nfTs Bought` and ` nf Ts Sold`, which are assigned values based on external state changes. These variables are dependent variables because they depend on changes to external contract state. However, these variables do not depend directly on ` success` in buy Jay No NFT.
