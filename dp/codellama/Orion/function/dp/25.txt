  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `require` statement checks that ` reserve A` is greater than  `0`.
Then, ` amount B`is calculated as `mul` of ` reserves B ` and `  reserve B`.  The ` require` statements ensure that the calculation is only performed if ` Reserve A ` is not zero.
Therefore,  the value of  amount `B `is dependent on `Reserve A`.
