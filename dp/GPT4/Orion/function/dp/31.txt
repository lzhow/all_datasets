Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `pool` in the function `pairForCurve` is assigned the value returned by the `find_pool_for_coins` function, which takes `tokenA` and `tokenB` as parameters. There is no direct data dependency between `pool` and `from` in the function `getAmountOutUniversal`. However, if `tokenA` or `tokenB` are somehow related to `from`, then there could be an indirect data dependency. Without further information about the relationship between `tokenA`, `tokenB`, and `from`, it is not possible to determine the data dependency between `pool` and `from` with certainty. Hence, the label is unknown.
