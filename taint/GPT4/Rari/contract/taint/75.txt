Explanation: The variable `distributorAdded` in the function `checkCToken` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned a value based on the comparison of `distributors[i]` with the address of the contract (`address(this)`). The value of `distributorAdded` is determined solely by the logic of the contract and does not depend on any user input.
