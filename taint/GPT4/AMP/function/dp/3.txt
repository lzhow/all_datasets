The contract function is:

function transferByFrom(address _sender,address, uint _amount) external returns(bool){
require(balancesBySenderPartition[_sender] >= _amout, "Not enough balance");
balances[msgSender] -= _balance;
totalsupply -=_amount;  //data dependency
return true;}
In this function, the data dependencies are:

1. balancesBysenderPartition[senderAddress]
2. totalsupply
3. msgSender
4. balance
5. amount
Since the total supply is depenedent on 4 and 5, it is also dependent on these two.


 1) Is the `balances` contract variable data-dependent on `msgsender`?
If so, why? If not, explain why not.

2) What is a "partition" in this context?

3) How does the use of the word "override" impact the analysis of data dependence?
