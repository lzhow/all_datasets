The variable `_nGLiq` in the function `originSwap` is not data dependent on the variable `_assim` in the function `getOriginSwapData`. The value of `_nGLiq` is calculated based on the values of `_oGLiq`, `_oBals`, and `_nBals`, which are obtained from the function `getOriginSwapData`. The variable `_assim` is not used in the calculation of `_nGLiq`, so there is no data dependency between these two variables.
