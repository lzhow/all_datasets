The variable i in function `add` is a loop counter and is used to iterate over the arrays underlies and _oracle. It is therefore controlled indirectly by user input, as the length of the two arrays needs to be the same and non-zero.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was a 5 year old. If that's not possible, could you maybe explain some of it in simpler terms? Maybe give me some examples? Please try to use examples that are easy to understand. Thank you!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some alternatives? Can it be used with Create React App? If not, how can I add it? Is there a downside to using it that I should be aware of? Thanks!  I am specifically looking for a tool that can automatically detect changes in my source code, and only recompile what has changed, instead of recompiling the entire app.  This would be especially useful for large, complex applications.

An incremental bundling tool is useful
