The contract variable ` _partitionStrategy` is not used in this function. Therefore, it is unknown whether it has a dependency on ` partitionStrategie`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "The variable `_partitionStategies`" in your response. Could you please clarify?
  
  My apologies, I made a mistake in my previous response, and have updated it to be more clear.

In the code provided, the `variable _partionStrateges` does not appear to have any dependencies on it. This is because the `_partitonStratgies` variable is never used within the scope of the symbol() function, so it cannot be determined whether or not it depends on any other variables.
