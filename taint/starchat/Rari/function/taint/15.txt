The variable jumpMultiplerPeryear is a user controlled parameter in this contract. It is used to determine the interest rate of the Jump Rate Model. If the value of this parameter is set to 1, then the model will have a constant interest. However, if this value is greater than 3, the rate will increase rapidly until it reaches the kinks of 50% utilisation. At this point, there will be a sudden jump in interest rates.

Eventually, this amount of interest, plus the amount you paid, will equal the original amount that
