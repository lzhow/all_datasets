Label: no

Reason: The variable `_factory` in the constructor is used to initialize the state variable `factory` and is independent of the variable `i` in the function `updateFactories`. The variable `i` in `updateFactories` is a loop counter used to iterate over the `factories` array and update the `supportedFactories` mapping. There is no data flow or dependency between `_factory` in the constructor and `i` in `updateFactories`, as they operate in different scopes and are used for different purposes. The value of `_factory` is set once during contract deployment and does not change or influence the loop counter `i`.
