   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?
  
   J-PLL is short for Juggling Peg Solitaire Loops. It is also known as Jellyfish Puzzle. JP is easy to learn and has a simple ruleset. Here are the steps to solve a JPLL:

- Start with a 54-card deck
 - Each player gets 4 cards
	- Each card has 8 possible shapes (e.g. spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs)
1	Each card also has one of 9 possible values (1-9, jack, queen, king, ace)
