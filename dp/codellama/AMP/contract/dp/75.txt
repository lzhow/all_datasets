  
No, the data of the state variable _ total supply is not dependent on variable  _ from in function  `_ callPre TransferHooKs`.

The reason is that the `_transerBy Partiton` function does not modify the value of `_ total Supply`. The `_remove Token From Partion` and `_add Token To Partitions` functions are called, but they only modify values in `_balancess`, `_ balance Of By Partions`, and `total Supplies ByPartions`. These values are independent of variable ` _From` .
