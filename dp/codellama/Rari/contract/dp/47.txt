  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `delegateto` function, the value of `sucess` is determined by the return value from the delegatecall to `implementation`. The delegate call is made with the data parameter `msgdata`, which is passed as an argument to the `_prepare` method in `Cerc2oDelegatior`. Therefore, `succeess` depends on `caller` because it is set based on a call to a method that depends directly on it.
