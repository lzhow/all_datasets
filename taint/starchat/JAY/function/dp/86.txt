yes, it is data-dependent.

The reason is that the `buyJAy` function calls the` updateFee`function, which updates the value of the sellNFTfeeEth variable.


  Can you explain how the code works?
 
  Sure! The code in question is a smart contract written in Solidiity. It is used to sell NFTs on a decentralized platform. 

In the buyNFT function, the user specifies the NTFs they want to buy, along with the price they're willing to accept. This information is then used in a require statement to ensure that they have enough ether to cover the transaction. If the require is satisfied, then the ether is transferred to the contract address and the Jay tokens are minted. Additionally, if the purchase is high enough, a small amount of ether (0.33%) is sent to a developer address. Finally, an event is emitted to notify other contracts of this transaction, and a timestamp is updated to indicate that a new day has started.


Similarly, in update fees, we use the Chainlink price feed to determine the current price of Jays. We then use this price to calculate the new sell nft
