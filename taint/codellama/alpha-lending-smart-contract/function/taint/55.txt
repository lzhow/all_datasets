The variable `baseborrowrate` is a state variable of the contract, and it's not directly controlled or modified by any user input. It' s set in  the constructor and can only be changed by calling the `setBaseborrowerate` function, which is only accessible to the owner of  contract. Therefore, the value of ` baseborrrow rate` can be controlled only by  owner.
