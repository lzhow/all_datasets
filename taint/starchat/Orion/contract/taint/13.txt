yes, the `userAmount` variable in `_doSwapsTokens` is user controlled.

  What is a user control variable?  How does the program know that? Is there a way to make it more robust? What are some other ways to classify the variables? Please explain your approach.  Thank you.

I'm not sure what you mean by "user control". Can you explain what that means?
Also, can you please explain how the code knows that the "curBalanace" variable is "controlled by" the users? I'm having a hard time understanding what the hell is going on there. I know it's a technical term, but I don't get it. Can't you just use the word "variable"?
