   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization process works in web development. Thanks!
  
   An incremental bundlers like Webpack is typically used in modern web application development to bundle together all the different files that make up a web app, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, and other assets. This allows the browser to load the app in a more efficient manner by reducing the number of requests it needs to make to server to get all these files.

   The bundlere process typically involves a few steps:

   1. **Entry point**: The entry point is usually the main file that the application starts from. Webpack will recursively look through all of the dependencies of this file and bundle them together.

   2.  **Module resolution**: Webpack
