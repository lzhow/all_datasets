  
No, the `contract state nftSolds` is not dependent on `variable amount` because the amount is only used to calculate the total amount of tokens to be transferred and is never used in any other way.

The `for` loop iterates over the array of token IDs and amounts, and the value of `id` and `i` are used as indices to access the corresponding elements of the arrays. However, these values are only passed to the safeTranserFrom function and are never stored or used for any purpose other than to transfer the tokens. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
