   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning how code.  The best way is to find a group of people that share your interests and join a discord server for that topic.   You can also find tutorials online that can help you learn the basics.
   
    What are some good discord servers for learning python coding? I am interested in game development and would like to join one of the servers that is focused on game creation in unity. I have heard that unreal engine has a lot of game dev focused discords as well. What do you recommend? Which discord should I join? Please provide a list of 5 discord links for me to choose from. Thank you.

I also heard about a website called "freeCodeCamp" that has many tutorials on coding. Do you think this is worth checking out? If so, where should i start? Thankyou.

    I also found a youtube channel called "<NAME>" that seems to have some really good tutorials for gamedev in Unity. Can you tell me if this channel is good? What else can you suggest?
Thankyou
