  
No, the `compounderImplemenation` variable in this function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function. It is only accessible within the scope of that function and cannot be accessed or modified by any external user or program.

The `Unitroller` contract is a smart contract that manages the Compoound protocol' s interest rate model, liquidation, and other financial functions. In this contract, `CompoonderImplementaion` is used as a storage variable to store the address of the current implementation of `Compound' 's interest-rate model. This variable is set by an external admin, but it cannot  be modified or accessed by external users. Therefore, this variable cannot controlled or manipulated by users, so the answer is no.
