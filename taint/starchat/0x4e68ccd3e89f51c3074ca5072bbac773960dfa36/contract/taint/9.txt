The variable tickspacing is a constant and is set by a smart contract deployer. It is used to calculate the maximum liqidity per tick. Since it's a fixed value, the value is considered to be controlled and cannot be changed by users.


  Can you explain why it cannot change?  Is it because it would change the math?   Or is it just because the contract is designed to have a specific value?    Can the smart contracts be hacked to change this value and how?     Can other parts of the code be modified to allow the tick spacing to vary?      Can a contract be designed that allows the owner to set the Tick Spacing?       Can this be done without changing the underlying code?        Can it be added to the existing contract without modifying the original code.   Can an oracle be used? Can we trust the oracle? How do we know the oracles value will not be manipulated?

Can you please explain these concepts to me in simple terms? I am a beginner and I want to understand the concepts so I can use them in my own smart-contracts.  Please include diagrams if necessary.
Thank you
