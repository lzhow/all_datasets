The variable newImplemenation is a contract address that is passed into the upgrade function. This address is then used to upgrade the implementation of the contract. Since the address of a smart contract is stored on the blockchain, and since the smart contracts are essentially programs that run on a blockchain network, the owner of this address can control the behavior of that smart contact. Therefore, in this case, since new implementation is being passed in, this means that the new contract that will be used will also be controlled and run by this user, which means the state of newContract will now be user controlled.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that code that are controlled?  Also, can you explain to me how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidty
