  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getReleaseAmout` function, the value of `toWeek` is calculated using the result of the call to the external function  ` findweekByblockNumber`. The value returned by `fineWeekbyBlocknumber` depends on `startblock`, which is a state variable of  the contract. Therefore, ` nextweekblock` in ` getreleaseAmount`is data-dependent on`start block`in `findeekByBockNumber`
