  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `Saferc2O` library, the  ` safeincreaselowance` function calls the `_calloptionalreturn` internal function, which in turn calls `address.functioncall` to call the ERc 2  token's `approval` method. This method takes three arguments: the spending address, an amount to increase the allowances by, and the current allowable amount.
Since the amount of the token to be increased is passed as an argument to the` safe increase allow`function, it is data-dependent on it. Therefore, ` token` is dependent on ` value` .
