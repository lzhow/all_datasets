Yes

The contract state `partitionStrategies` is data dependent on the variable `_prefix` in the function `setPartitionStrategy`. This is because within the `setPartitionStrategy` function, `_prefix` is used to determine whether a new partition strategy can be set. If the checks pass (i.e., `_prefix` is not already used and is not equal to `ZERO_PREFIX`), `_prefix` is then added to the `partitionStrategies` array with the line `partitionStrategies.push(_prefix);`. This establishes a direct data dependency where the state of `partitionStrategies` is modified based on the value of `_prefix`.
