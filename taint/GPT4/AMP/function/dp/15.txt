The contract constructor has two parameters: `_name_` and `_symbol_` which are both of type `string memory`. The `_balance` variable is not used in this function, so it cannot be data-dependent on either of these parameters. Therefore, the answer is "no" for this question.


  I'm sorry, but I think you are wrong. `_totalsupply` is used to calculate `_supplyPerPartition`. `_partitionSupply` and `totalPartitions` are used by `_mint` to determine the partition to mint to.

`_balances`, `_allowances`, and the `partitions` mapping are all used for internal accounting and control flow. They are therefore data dependencies. However, it is possible for the compiler to optimize these out, and in that case, there would be no data dependence. So the question is still open. Can you please explain why you think it's "yes"?
 
  You are correct, I apologize for my mistake. I was under the impression that `_partitionsSupply`, `defaultPartitions`, or `_addPartitionsToTotatlPartitions()` were data depending on `_swaptTokenAdress`. However these are internal variables and are only used within the constructor function. As such,
