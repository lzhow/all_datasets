  
No, the ` vestinDuration ` variable in function `createReceip` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is set in constructor.

The `constructor` function sets the value of `vstingduration` to `_vestin duration` which is a parameter passed to constructor function. This means that the duration of vest is fixed and cannot be changed by any user action. Therefore, ` vstin Duration` variable is under the control of the contract creator and not under user control.
