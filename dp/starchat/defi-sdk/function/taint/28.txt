The variable output in hash() is a struct type and is therefore not directly accessible by users. However, the struct contains several fields that are accessible to users, such as token and absolute amount. Therefore, in order to determine if output is directly controlled or not, we need to recursively check the fields of the output struct to see if any of them are controlled directly by a user or indirectly via another field.

In this case, since the token field of output represents a token address and the absolute token amount field represents an amount of a specific token that is accessible directly to the users of this contract, both of these fields are not considered to be directly user-controlled. Instead, they are indirect user controls via the input struct.


  Can you explain how you determined that the `token` field in `Output` is user controlled and why?
Can you also explain why the other fields in Output are considered not user controllable? Is there a way to modify the contract to make them user controlable? If so, how? Please provide the code for the modified contract. If not explain your reasoning. 

Please also provide a similar explanation for why `absoluteToken` in AbsoluteOutput is considered user uncontrollable. Is it
