  
No, the `contract state` ` autoImplementaion` is not dependent on `variable` err in function` _ deployMarkets`.

The reason is that the state variable is defined outside the scope of the `_ deploy Markets` function, and it is only modified within the context of another function called `_set CollateraFacor`. Therefore, it cannot be directly affected by the value of ` err` within `_deplyMarkers`.
