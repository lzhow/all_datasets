In the `_do_swapTokes` function, the `curBalances` variable is assigned the balance of the token at index `i` of `amount` array.
Then, in `_add_liquidty` the amount of token A is calculated using the formula ` amount = amount * (1 - (cur_balances[index] / amount))`.
This means that the value of amount is dependent on ` cur_Balnces[ index ]` and ` amounts [ index ].
Therefore, ` input` is data-dependent on  ` path` .
