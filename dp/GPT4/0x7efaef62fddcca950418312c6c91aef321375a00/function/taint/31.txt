Reason: The variable `_token1` in the `initialize` function of the `PancakePair` contract is not directly controlled by the user. This function is designed to be called only once by the factory contract at the time of pair creation. The `require(msg.sender == factory, 'Pancake: FORBIDDEN');` line ensures that only the factory contract, which is typically a trusted and immutable contract deployed by the developers of the PancakeSwap protocol, can call the `initialize` function. Therefore, the assignment of `_token1` is controlled by the factory contract logic and not by an arbitrary user.
