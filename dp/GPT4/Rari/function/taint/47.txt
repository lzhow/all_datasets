The variable `borrowerAmount` in the function `distributeBorrowerComp` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `borrowerAmount` is derived from the function `CToken(cToken).borrowBalanceStored(borrower)`, which retrieves the borrow balance of the `borrower` from the `CToken` contract. The value of `borrower` is passed as an argument to the function `distributeBorrowerComp`. Since the value of `borrower` is not controlled by the user within the `RewardsDistributorDelegate` contract, the variable `borrowerAmount` is not controlled by the user.
