The variable fromblock is data-dependent on toblock in getreleaseamount. This is because the loop in this function iterates over each week, and the from and to blocks of each iteration depend on each other.


  Can you explain why this is so?
 
  Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of why the `while` loop iterating over weeks in `AlphaContract.sol` is dependent on `block` and `lastBlock`:

1. `startblock`: The startblock variable is set to 200903010 (March 3, 4:06:41 AM UTC on January 9,221) in line 50 of the contract.

2. `_fromblock > _tblock || to_block <=start_Block|| last_blok <=_from_blo`: This condition is checked in lines 60-61 of `alphacontract. sol`. If this condition evaluates to true, the while loop will not run.

- `_toblock <last_bloc`: If the `_t_ block` variable in `_getreleaseAmount` function is less than the last block, then the
