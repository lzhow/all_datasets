There is no direct data dependence between the two functions. However, there is an indirect data flow between them.
In the `transfer` function, the argument `amount` is passed to the internal function`transfertTokes`. This function is defined in another contract, and its implementation is not provided in this code snippet. Therefore, it is unclear whether the data in `msg` and `dst` are directly or indirectly dependent on ` mintamount`.
However, we can assume that the implementation of ` transfertToks` does not modify the value of` mint amount`. Therefore the indirect dependence is limited to ` msg`and ` dst`.
