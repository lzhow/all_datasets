Reason: The variable `len` in the function `enterMarkets` is not directly dependent on the variable `mintTokens` in the function `mintVerify`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `mintTokens` in the code snippet provided. However, there might be a potential data dependency between `len` and `mintTokens` if there is some other code or logic that connects these two variables outside of the given code snippet. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship between `len` and `mintTokens`.
