  
No, the variables ` comp Accru_ ` and ` supplerIndex ` are independent.

The variable  `  comp  Accrue_  '  is defined in  the  function  update  Comp  Supply  Index  and  it  represents  a  temporary  variable that  stores  an  intermediate  result  of  calculating  interest  accrual  for  supplying  tokens  to  c  Token  contract.  The  value  stored  by  this  varaible  depends  on  several  factors  such  as  current  block  number,  supply  speed  ,  total  token  amount  supplied  etc.   The variable is only used within the scope of the update Comp Suppy Index function and is never used outside of that function. Therefore, it is independent of any other variable. On the other hand, `Suppler Index` is a state variable of `RedeemDistribution` contract and it stores the index of comp accrural for a suppplier. It is updated in `updateComp Supplier Index ` function, which is called in` distrubuteSupppilerComp` function to calculate the interest accural of suppllier for c Token contract . Therefore , the ` Suppler  index` and` comp Acru _` are dependent on each other.
