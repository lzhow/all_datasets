Label: no

Reason: The variable `errorMessage` in the function `functionCall` and the unnamed variable (empty backticks ``) in the function `functionDelegateCall` do not have a data dependency relationship. Each function in the Solidity code operates independently with its own set of parameters. The `errorMessage` variable in `functionCall` is a parameter that is passed to the function and used within its scope. Similarly, the `functionDelegateCall` has its own set of parameters, and the unnamed variable mentioned does not exist in the context of this function. There is no direct interaction or data flow between these two variables across the two functions, hence they are not data dependent.
