  
The variable _`optimaUtilizatioRate ` in function contructor is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the constructor function is called by a user, and the value of _ `optimumUtilizaionRate is passed as an argument. Therefore, the contract can be controlled or manipulated by users.

In the same way, other variables such as _ `_baseborrowRate`, _ _colaterlPercent`, and _  `liquidaionBounsPercent` are also controlled  by user because they are passed to the contructer function as arguments.
