Label: no

Reason: The variable `_operator` in the function `revokeOperator` and the variable `_prefix` in the function `setPartitionStrategy` do not have a data dependency relationship. The variable `_operator` is used to manage operator permissions for the contract, specifically to revoke an operator's status. On the other hand, `_prefix` is used to manage partition strategies within the contract. These two variables operate in different contexts and are used for different purposes within the contract. There is no code in the provided Solidity contract that indicates a direct or indirect relationship where the value of one would affect or be derived from the value of the other. Each function manipulates different state variables and serves different functionalities.
