Label: yes

Reason: The contract state `pools` is data dependent on the variable `liquidateShares` in the function `liquidateInternal`. This is because `liquidateShares` is used to calculate `liquidateAmount` through the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount`, which is then used to update `pool.totalBorrows` and `pool.totalBorrowShares` by subtracting `liquidateAmount` and `liquidateShares` respectively. Since `pool` is a storage reference to an element in the `pools` mapping, this means that the state of `pools` is being modified based on the value of `liquidateShares`.
