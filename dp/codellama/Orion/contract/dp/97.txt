  
No, the `variable value` is not dependent on `the variable token`in the  function  ` safe Decreased Allowance`.

The reason is that the value of ` value ` is calculated using the method `sub` from the library `SaferMath`, which takes two arguments: `a` and `b`. The value returned by ` sub`is not directly dependent  on  the` token ` variable.
