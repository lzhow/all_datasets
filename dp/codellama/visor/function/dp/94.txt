In the `function decreaseallowance`, the `_approval` function is called, which takes three arguments: `_msgsender()`, `spende`, and `_ allowances[msg.sender][sender]. sub( subtractValue)`. The third argument is a function call, and the first argument of the called function, `_ msgSender()`, is equal to the value of `msg sender`. Therefore, the state of `_allownances`, which is an array of addresses and their corresponding allowable amounts, is dependent on `sender`.
