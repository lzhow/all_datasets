  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `while` loop of the first function, the value of `low` is updated based on `array` and `element`. The value ` mid`is calculated based ` low`and ` high`. Therefore, `middle` depends on both ` array` ` element` , and` low`.
Similarly, in `function` findupperbound,` high` also depends ` middle` because it is calculated using `Math. average` which depends` mid`.
