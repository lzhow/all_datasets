  
No, the `total_supply` variable in function ` total_Suppy` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a public variable that is defined in a contract and it can be accessed by anyone.

The `public` keyword in Solidiy means that the state variable is accessible from outside the contract, and can only be modified by calling the functions of the same contract. In this case, `balanaceOf` function can modify the value of ` _ total Supply`, but it cannot be directly accessed or modified from the outside.
