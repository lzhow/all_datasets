The variable proxy in getproxyImplementation() is a user-controlled input. It is passed into the method as an argument, and the calling contract has the ability to modify the value of the proxy variable before calling the getImplementation method. This could result in unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.


  Can you give me an example of how to exploit this? I'm trying to write a smart contract that uses a proxy contract to upgrade itself. I want to make sure that the owner of my contract can't change the implementation of that proxy to point to a malicious contract. How can I do that? Can I just not use a variable called "proxy" in my smart contracts? How do I know that I won't accidentally overwrite the address of a critical contract with a simple variable name? What if I wanted to call a function on the critical proxy? For example, I have a contract named "CriticalContract" that has a payble fallback function. If I call the fallback on a CriticalContract that is proxied by my own contract, how can my owner prevent the call from being forwarded to the mallicious implementation? Is there a way to use modifiers or other solidity features to prevent this from happening?
