yes, the `_defaultOperator` variable is a mapping of address => address, which is user controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding how it works. I think it's important to understand how code like this works so that I can use it in my own contracts. Can explain it to me like I know how to speak English. If you need help with a specific part of the contract, please let me know. Thanks!
 
  Sure, here's a brief explanation of how this contract works:

The contract inherits from two base contracts: `ERC-223` and `I-ERC 721`. The `2` in `ECR-752-3`, `7` is `R` for `Receiving` which means that the token can be sent to an address. `5` means `five` so it can hold 5 tokens.
