  
No, the variables ` lower` and ` fee Grow th Above  ` are independent.

The variable  lower is defined as a storage variable in a mapping, which means it is a reference to a value stored in memory. It is not directly dependent on any other variable.  The variable fee  G row th  A above  is also defined in this function as an internal variable, and it has the same scope as the lower variable . Therefore, it cannot be considered as data-dependent on lower .
