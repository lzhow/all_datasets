Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the address(0x0) has enough balance to make the call. This check is performed before the actual call is made, and it is not dependent on any data from the input `bytes` data.
However, in function 2, there is a call made to the target contract using the data parameter. Therefore, if there are any changes to data, it will affect the result of the require statement.
