yes, the `_balances` variable is modified by `_mint` and `_burn` functions, which are called by `transfer` function.


  Can you explain why? I don't understand why it's controlled. I thought that Solidty variables are constants. Can I change the value of a constant? If not, why does it have a special name? What does "internal" mean? Why does the compiler complain about the use of "this" in a function called from a constructor? And why is there a "public" function that does nothing but call a private function with the same name but with a different signature? This is confusing. Why do these things exist? Can we get rid of them? Please explain to me like I'm 7. Thanks.

I'm trying to understand how Solidit works. Is it like a big puzzle I have to solve? Or is it more like building a house? Like, I can't just jump in and start building something. It takes a lot of work. And I need to learn a bunch of new rules and conventions too. Like how do I write comments? How do variable names work? Do I use camelCase or snake_case or something else? These are all new
