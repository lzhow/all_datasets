Reason: The variable `self` in the function `grow` refers to the storage array of `Observation` structs that the function operates on. It is used to set the `blockTimestamp` of each `Observation` in the array to 1, up to the new size specified by the `next` parameter.

The variable `r` in the function `binarySearch` is a local variable used as a part of the binary search algorithm to find the correct `Observation` within the `self` array based on the `target` timestamp. It is used to keep track of the upper bound of the search range.

There is no direct data dependency between `self` in `grow` and `r` in `binarySearch` because `self` is an array that is being modified in `grow`, while `r` is a local variable used for searching within the array in `binarySearch`. The operations performed on `self` in `grow` do not depend on the value of `r` from `binarySearch`, and the value of `r` is not influenced by the modifications made to `self` in `grow`. They operate independently within their respective functions and do not share state or influence each other's computations.
