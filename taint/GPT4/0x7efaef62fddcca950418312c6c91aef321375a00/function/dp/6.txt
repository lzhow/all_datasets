Reason: The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is determined by the outcome of the `token.call` operation, which is a low-level call to transfer tokens. It does not depend on the value of `balance1` in the function `swap`. The variable `balance1` is assigned later in the `swap` function and represents the token balance after potentially transferring tokens out. There is no direct data flow from `balance1` to `success` as they are involved in separate operations and `success` is set before `balance1` is even calculated.
