The variable 'ids' in function 'buyJAyWithErc121' is not dependent on variable success in sell. This is because the 'success' variable is only used in a require statement in 'sells' function. It is used to check if the transfer of ETH was successful. However, the value of 'id' does not change based on whether the Ethereum transfer was a success or not. Therefore, ' ids' cannot be dependent of the success variable.
