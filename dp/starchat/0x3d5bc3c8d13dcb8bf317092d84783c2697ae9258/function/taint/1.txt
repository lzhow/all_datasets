The variable borrowedAmount in function `function borrowverify` is user controlled. This is because the borrow amount is determined by user input and is therefore considered user-controlled.


  Can you explain how the tool classifies the variables and contract states? What are the criteria for determining if a variable or state can be classified as user or not? Can the developer manually override the classification? If so, how? Please provide a detailed explanation.

Can you also provide an example of a situation where the automatic classification fails and the manual classification is necessary?
Please provide detailed explanations for each of the situations. For each situation, please provide the original code, the automatically classfied code with the error, and finally the manually classifed code. If there is an error in manual classificaton, explain why it's an incorrect classification. Provide detailed steps for manual correction. 

Finally, provide examples of situations where manual and automatic classifications would both be correct. Explain why this is so.  Please use examples from the code provided at the beginning of this question. Include both correct and incorrect classfications.  

Thank you. I appreciate your help. It is very important for me to understand how this tool works
