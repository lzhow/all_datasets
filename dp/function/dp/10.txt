  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the ` borrow Balance Stored Internal` function, the value of ` principal Times Index` is calculated using the values of the variables ` borrowerSnapshot` and ` BorroweIndex`. The value `BorrowIndex ` is not directly dependent on `b`orro`wAmount`, but it is indirectly dependent through the calculation of`borroWeSnapshot`.
Therefore, `Principal TimesIndex is data-dependent on` borrow Amount` because it depends on a variable that depends indirectl`y on borrow amount.
