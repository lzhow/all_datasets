The contract function 'change_admin' has a 'data dependency' relationship between the two contract variables: 'admin', and the new value of 'new_Admin'.

In the body of the 'chage_admi' function, the value assigned to the local variable 'old_Admi', is dependent on both the existing value stored in 'admn', as well as the newly assigned value 'ne_adm'.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependent relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
  
  Data dependent relationships are relationships between two or more variables that are determined by the values of those variables. In the case of Solidty, this means that the relationship is determined at runtime by how the variables are used in a contract.
For example, in Solidit, if a variable is assigned a value that is later used to access a storage location, then the storage variable and variable are said to have an "indirect data dependence" relationship, because the depend on each other's values.
