Reason: In the provided Solidity function `decreaseAllowance`, the contract state `_allowances` is directly accessed and modified based on the `subtractedValue` parameter. The function retrieves the current allowance for the `_msgSender()` and `spender` from the `_allowances` mapping, then subtracts the `subtractedValue` from it using the `.sub` method (which is likely a SafeMath subtraction to prevent underflow). This modified value is then used in the `_approve` function to update the `_allowances` mapping. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the contract state `_allowances` and the variable `subtractedValue` because the value of `_allowances` for a specific sender and spender is being updated based on the value of `subtractedValue`.
