Reason: The variable `deltaBlocks` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is calculated as the difference between the current block number and the block number stored in `supplyState.block`. It is used to determine the number of blocks that have passed since the last supply index update for a given market.

On the other hand, the variable `compSpeed` in the function `updateContributorRewards` represents the speed at which rewards are accrued to a contributor. It is used to calculate the new accrued amount for a contributor based on the number of blocks that have passed since the last contributor reward update.

These two variables operate within different contexts and are used for different purposes. The calculation of `deltaBlocks` does not rely on the value of `compSpeed`, nor does the calculation of the new accrued amount for a contributor depend on the value of `deltaBlocks`. They are independent of each other and there is no direct data dependency relationship between them.
