  
The label is 'No'.

In this case, the `divCeiling` function is an internal function, which means that it can only be called from within the same contract. Therefore, `a` and `b` are not user-controlled variables.
Furthermore, since the division is performed using the `/` operator, and the result is rounded up using `ceil`, the resulting value of ` c` is also not a user input.  Therefore the value `C` in this function cannot be controlled directly by a malicious user, as it depends on the values of the input variables ` a`and ` b`.
