  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `function` ` getAmoutOut`, the local variable  ` amountinWithfee` is calculated by multiplying `amoutIn ` by 0.9. This value is then used in a calculation to determine the value of `numerator`. The `denominator` variable is also calculated using the same value. Therefore, the calculation of the two local variables ` numeratior` and ` denominatir` are dependent on ` amoutinwithfees`.
On the other hand, in ` function` getreserves, there is no direct relationship between the variables.
