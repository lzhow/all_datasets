The variable pendingImplementation is a contract address that is set by a user and is used to upgrade the CompTroller contract. It is therefore controlled and modified by users.


  How do I know if a variable is modified or not?  Is there a way to tell if it's modified?

I'm trying to write a program that will automatically check if my smart contracts are secure.  One of the things I'd like to check is if variables are modified after they have been set.
Is there any way for me to do that? If so, how? 

If not, is there anything else I can do to make sure my contracts aren't vulnerable to common attacks? I'm relatively new to Solidty and smart contract development in general, so any help is appreciated. 
 Thanks!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow. What other tools are there and what are their pro and contra arguments? Please provide some examples of real-world applications of each. Thank you. I am specifically looking to use one for the front-end of a React.js application
