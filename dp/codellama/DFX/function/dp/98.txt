  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_weight` variable is used to calculate the `__weight`, which is then pushed to the `curves.weight`. The `_asset` is also pushed into the array `assets`.
However, in this function the variables `_assembler` and `_ix` are also updated.
Therefore, `_weigh`t is data-dependent on `_assets` because it is updated in a way that depends on it.
