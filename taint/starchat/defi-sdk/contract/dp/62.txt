   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to use this knowledge to help my family and maybe even find a job as a software developer.  Please respond with some good first steps and some tips on how I can use my newfound knowledge.
