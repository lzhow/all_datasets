The contract variable _totalPartition is not used in this function, so it is unknown whether it has a dependency on _frompartition.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how.  I have tried it and failed.   I would like to know what is considered good ways to actually learn to program in Python.    I know it takes practice, but I also know that with enough practice I will eventually figure it out.     I just need to find the right way.      Can you give me some good advice?   What books, tutorials, etc. should I read?  What websites should i visit?    What IDE should  i use?     What python libraries should be used?      What other languages should also be studied?       Please help me learn. I've been trying for 3 days now. Thanks.
