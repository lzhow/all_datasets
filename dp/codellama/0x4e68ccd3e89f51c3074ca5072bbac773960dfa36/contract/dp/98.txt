  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `tickSpacinToMxLiuqidtyPerick` function, the local variable  `minTic` is calculated as `(TikMath .MIN-TIK / tikSpcing)  * ticSpcng`. The local  variable`max Tic ` is also calculated in a similar way.
Then, in ` getfeegrowtheInsid`e, ` fee GrowtBelw0x1x2` and ` feegrothBelo1 x1  x2 ` are calculated.  The `if` statement checks if ` tickcurrent `is greater than or equal to ` ticklower `. If it is, then `  fee growtheBelwo0 x  is set to the value of ` lower .feegaGroweOutsde0 X  `. Otherwise , it sets ` f ee grow theBel wo0  X ` to  the difference between `f eeg rowthGloba l0`and `lower . feega G rowtheOut sde  .`
Similarly, if the condition is not met, it calculates `F eega growth Above  o x  1 X  2`.
Therefore,  both ` F e e grow thBel w0   X`   and  Fee growtAbo ve  O x   1   x    2  are dependent on ` Feeg ro wth Glob a l  l  0`.
