  
No, the ` er c7 31 Ids` variable in function `buynft` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` buynFT` function is called by a user, but the value of the parameter `er c 73 51 ids` comes from the contract itself, not from a direct user input. Therefore, this variable is considered not to be controlled directly by users.
