The variable `amount1` in the function `burn` is data dependent on the variable `_totalSupply` because `amount1` is calculated using `_totalSupply` in the following line of code:

```solidity
amount1 = liquidity.mul(balance1) / _totalSupply;
```

Here, `amount1` is directly computed by dividing the product of `liquidity` and `balance1` by `_totalSupply`. Therefore, any changes to the value of `_totalSupply` will affect the computed value of `amount1`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
