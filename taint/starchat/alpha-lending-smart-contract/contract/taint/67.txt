The variable raw in function `decodeBytes` is a reference to a memory location that contains the raw bytes of the input data stream. Since the data is stored in a byte array, the value of raw can be modified by any function that has access to the memory address of that array. Therefore, in general, we cannot determine whether the `bytes` variable is user-controlled or not.


  Can you explain why you can't determine if it's user controlled?  What are some examples of things that could modify the contents of a `byte` array?

I'm trying to understand how I can use your tool to help me write secure smart contracts.  I'm particularly interested in how to prevent common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflow, and reentrancy attacks.
Can you help explain how your analysis can help with these types of vulnerabilites? How can I use the information you provide to write safer smart contract? Please provide examples if possible. 

Thank you for your help!
