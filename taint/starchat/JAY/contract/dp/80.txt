yes, it is.

The reason is that the `for` loop in `function buyerc2235` iterates over the elements of the arrays `ids` and `ammounts`, and the value of `id` is used to index into both arrays. If the values of these arrays are stored in memory locations `x`and `y`, respectively, then the data dependence can be expressed as:
`x[i] -> y[j]` for all `i` such that `0 <= i < length(ids)` and all j such than `  j < lengths(ammonts)`.
In this case, the array `er1c2d5tAddress` contains pointers to NFT contracts, and so the pointer in location `k` of this array can point to an NTF contract that is stored at memory location` er1cd5Addressk`. Similarly, ` er7cB51tIds`contains the identifiers of Nfts in each contract pointed to by the pointers in er52cD5TAddress`. The array erC1d45AmmountS contains the amounts of each Nft that will be bought.
