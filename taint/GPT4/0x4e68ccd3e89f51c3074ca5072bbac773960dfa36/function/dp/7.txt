The variable `l` is directly initialized with the value of `index` plus one, modulo `cardinality`. This means that the initial value of `l` is dependent on the value of `index`. Furthermore, within the while loop, `l` may be updated based on its own previous value and other conditions, but its initial dependency on `index` establishes a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
