  
The variable 'from Partitions Validator Implementation' in function '_call PreTransfersHooKs' is labeled as 'No'.

This is because the value of 'From Partitons Validation Implementaion' comes from the interface address of the contract, which is a constant value that is set at the time of deployment. It is therefore not possible for the end user to control the implementation of this interface.
