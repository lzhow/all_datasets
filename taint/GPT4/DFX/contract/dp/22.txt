The variable `_amt` in the function `viewTargetSwapData` is not dependent on the variable `_o` in the function `viewTargetSwap`. The variable `_amt` is assigned a value within the `viewTargetSwapData` function and is not influenced by the value of `_o` in any way. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
