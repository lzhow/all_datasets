Explanation:
In the given code, the `accruteInterst()` function is called before the redemption process. This function updates the account's interest rate and returns an error code if there is an issue. If the error is not `Error::NO-ERROR`, the transaction is reverted.
If the interest is updated successfully, then the remaining code in `reddemInternal` function will be executed. In this function, `msgSender` is used to get the address of the caller, and `0` as the value of `borrowIndex` to recalculate the borrow balance.  The `error` variable is then returned. Therefore, if the data in accountTokes is changed by the accrued interest, it will affect the calculation of reedem tokens. Hence, account tokens is data-dependent on reedeemtokens.
