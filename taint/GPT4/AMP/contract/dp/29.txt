Yes

The variable `amount` in the function `swap` is data dependent on the variable `_from` because `amount` is assigned the return value of `swapToken.allowance(_from, address(this))`, which is a function call that queries the allowance of the `_from` address. The allowance is a mapping that specifies how much the contract is allowed to use on behalf of the `_from` address. Since the value of `amount` directly depends on the value of `_from`, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
