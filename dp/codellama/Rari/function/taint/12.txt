  
The variable borrwer in function `flywheePreborrwoerAction` is a parameter of the method, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user of a smart contract. Therefore, the answer is yes.

In this function, `distributeborowerComp` function is called, and the borower parameter is passed to it. This means the `compborowserIndex` mapping is updated with the current borowwer index. Since the index is derived from the borrow balance of an account, this means a malicious user can manipulate the value of `comborwserindex` for a particular account by manipulating the balance.
