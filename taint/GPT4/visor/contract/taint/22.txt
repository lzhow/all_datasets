Label: yes

Reason: The variable `newOwner` in the function `transferOwnership` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called. Since this function is public and does not have any restrictions on who can call it other than the `onlyOwner` modifier, any user who is the current owner of the contract can call this function and specify the value for `newOwner`. Therefore, the value of `newOwner` is controlled by the user, specifically the user who is the current owner of the contract at the time the function is called.
