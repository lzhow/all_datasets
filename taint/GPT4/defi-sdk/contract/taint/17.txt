The variable `inputToken` in the function `callBytes` is controlled by the user because it is passed as part of the `callerCallData` argument to the function. This data is decoded from the calldata, which is provided by the user when they call the function. Since the user constructs the calldata, they have control over the contents of `inputToken`.
