  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `checkCToker` function, the local variable ctoken is assigned the value of the input parameter ctokne. This means that the two ctokens are the same.
However, in `fywheelpreborowerAction`, the coken parameter is passed as an argument to `updateCompborowIndex`, which calls `compborrrowstate[ctoken]. index`. This is a different ctaken from the one in checkctokne, but it is still the correct ctkne that is being used. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the variables.
