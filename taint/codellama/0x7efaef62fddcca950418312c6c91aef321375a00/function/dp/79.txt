  
No, the SELECTOR is not dependent on rootk.

The SELECTO is a constant value that is set when the smart contract is deployed. It is used to identify the specific function that should be called when a transaction is sent to the address of the deployed contract.  The SELECTER is therefore not affected by the value of root k.
