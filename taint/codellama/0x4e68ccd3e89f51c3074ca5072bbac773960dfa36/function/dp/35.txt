Explanation :
In the swap function, the amount of token0 and token1 that is transferred to the recipients is calculated using the `state` variable, which is a struct that contains the current state of the pool. Specifically, it contains information about the liquidities, fees, and prices of both tokens.
However, in this function the value of `sqrtpriceX` is not changed, so it is independent of any other variable. Therefore, `sqrpricex` does not depend on `steps`.
On the other hand, The value `liquity` of liquidty is changed in a loop, but it does depend only on itself and the initial value, not on any external variable such as ` steps`. Therefore ` liquid` depends on  ` step`.
