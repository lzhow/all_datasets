The variable `offset` in `Data` struct is user controlled.


  What is a struct? What does it mean to be "user controlled"?
  
  A struct in Solidty is like a custom data type that you can define yourself. It is used to group together related data and functions that work on that data into a single unit. In the case of the `Obis` library, the struct `data` is defined as a user-controlled variable. This means that the value of `offest` can be modified by calling functions like `decodeBytes` and `shift`.

 
   What are the benefits of using structs? Why do you think they are used so often in solidity? Are there any other ways to achieve the same functionality without using a `struct`?
