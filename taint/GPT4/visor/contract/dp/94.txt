Label: yes

Reason: In the Solidity code provided, the `functionCall` function internally calls the `functionCallWithValue` function, passing the `target` variable as an argument. The `functionCallWithValue` function then uses the `target` variable to perform a low-level call with a potential value transfer. Since the `target` variable is passed from `functionCall` to `functionCallWithValue` and is used in a critical operation within `functionCallWithValue`, there is a direct data dependency between the `target` variable in `functionCall` and the `target` variable in `functionCallWithValue`. The behavior of `functionCallWithValue` is directly influenced by the value of `target` received from `functionCall`.
