  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the given code, the constructor function has two parameters: `_ swap_token_address_ ` and `_name _`. The constructor also initializes several contract variables, including `_total_supply_`, `_default_partition_`.
However, there is no direct relationship between the `_ is_collater_manager_ _` variable and the` _ swap _token _address _ ` variable. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the two are dependent on each other.
Therefore, we label the relationship as ' Unknown'.
