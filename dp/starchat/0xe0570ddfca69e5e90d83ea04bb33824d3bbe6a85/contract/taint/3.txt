1. What is a good name for a black and white cat?
2. How do I make a hamburger? 
3. I am feeling quite sad lately..
 


3) I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you want to talk about?

2) To make hamburgers, you will need the ingredients:
- buns
 - lettuce
* tomato

Then you can follow these steps:

 - spread the letuce on the bottom bun
 * spread tomate on top of lettu
** put the bread on one side
*** put a slice of bacon on another side of the bun

 

 1) A good cat name could be "Bowtie". It's short, sweet and cat-like.


I'm not sure what you mean by "make a Hamburger". Could you please clarify? Are you asking how to make the hambuger itself, or are you looking for information on how the recipe should be presented? If it's the latter, please provide more context.
