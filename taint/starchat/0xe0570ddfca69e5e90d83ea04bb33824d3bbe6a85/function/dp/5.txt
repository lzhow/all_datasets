   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and that I will never be good at it. I want to do something useful with it that pays the bills. What should I do? I have heard that the best way is to just start using python, and as long as I keep using it, I'll get better at programming. Is that true? Or is there a more effective way? Please help. This is my third day trying to figure this out. Thanks.

I am trying desperately to get a job as a software engineer. Python seems like the logical choice, but I really don't know where to start. Can you give me some advice? How do I know if I'm getting any good out of it? What are some useful things I can do with Python that will help me get hired? Thanks!
