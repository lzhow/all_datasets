  
No, the variables ` c TokenAddress ` and ` old Collateralfactor Mantissa ` are independent.

The reason is that the `exit Market` function is called with the address of the c token as an argument, and the `_ setCollteral Factor` method is used to set the collteralfactormantissamantis of a specific ctoken. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
