Reason: The contract state `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT` is a constant string defined at the beginning of the contract and is used to represent an interface name for the ERC1820 registry. It is not modified anywhere in the contract and serves as a key for looking up the address of the token recipient contract that implements the `IAmpTokensRecipient` interface.

The variable `toPartitionPrefix` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` is a local variable that is derived from the `_toPartition` parameter of the function. It is used to determine if there is a partition strategy associated with the partition prefix and to perform validation if such a strategy exists.

Since `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT` is a constant and not modified by any function, and `toPartitionPrefix` is a local variable whose value is determined independently of `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT`, there is no data dependency relationship between them. The value of `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT` does not depend on the value of `toPartitionPrefix`, nor does the value of `toPartitionPrefix` depend on `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT`.
