  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if `b` is less than or equal to ` a`. If this condition is not met, an error is thrown with the message `errorMessage`. The `return` expression is only executed if the condition passes, which means that ` b` must be less or equals to  `  a` for the expression to be executed. Therefore, ` ` is data-dependent on ` `.
Similarly, in function 2,  the  variable  is also data -dependent  on  because the require statement  checks  if  b  less  than  or  equal  to a.
