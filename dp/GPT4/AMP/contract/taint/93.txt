The variable _`authorizedOperatoByPartiton`_ is a mapping of type `mapping(addres =>mapping (address=>mapping))`. It is used to track the authorized operators for each partition.

In Solidty, mappings are not accessible directly from the contract. Instead, they are accessed through functions that are defined in a contract and can be called from other contracts. In this case, the functions are `authorizeOperator` and `revokeOperator`.
Therefore, we cannot determine if `_authorizdOperatorbyPartition ` is controled by a user or not.


  How can I determine that?  Is there a way to determine the source code of the smart contract? If so, can you provide it to me?
If not, is there another way I can determine this? I am a software engineer and I have experience with static code analysis. I would like to use that experience to help me determine what is and isnt controlled. Can you help provide me with a list of steps I could take to do this analysis? Please provide detailed step-by-step instructions. If you need any more information, please ask. Thank you.
