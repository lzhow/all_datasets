In the first code snippet in the mutated file, both lines marked with a `+` sign indicate a semantic change. However, in both of the other two example code snippets, there is only a change in one line that is clearly a bug fix. Therefore it can be said that both the original and mutants are bug-free, but the mutation itself can lead to different output code, as demonstrated by the second mutating example.
