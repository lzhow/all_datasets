  
The answer is 'Yes'.

In the `multiProofverifyCalData` function, the value of `leaf` is used to compute the return value. Specifically, it is passed as an argument to the `_hashpair` method, which is called within the loop in `procesMultiproofCaldata`. This means that the values of the elements of`leave` are used in computing the hash values stored in`hashes`. Therefore, `Leaves `is data-dependent on` hashpos`.
