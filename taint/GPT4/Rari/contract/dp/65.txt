Reason: The variable `borrowState` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is used to track the state of the borrowing market for a specific cToken, including the index and the last block number when the index was updated. On the other hand, the variable `supplierAccrued` in the function `distributeSupplierComp` is used to track the accumulated rewards for a supplier address based on their supply balance and the supply index.

These two variables operate in different contexts within the contract: `borrowState` is related to the borrowing side of the market, while `supplierAccrued` is related to the supply side. The calculations and updates of these variables are independent of each other, and there is no direct data flow or dependency between them within the given functions or the contract as a whole. The `updateCompBorrowIndex` function updates the borrow index based on the borrow speed and the time elapsed, while the `distributeSupplierComp` function calculates and updates the rewards for suppliers based on the supply index and the supplier's balance. There is no shared state or computation that would create a data dependency between `borrowState` and `supplierAccrued`.
