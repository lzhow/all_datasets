The variable _ logic is a contract address that is set by a user, so it can be considered controlled.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract and label them as either "controlled" or "not controlled"?
 
  Yes, here is an updated list with the labels "yes", "no", and "unknown" for each variable:

- `_data`: yes
 - `_implementation`: unknown
`_logic`: controlled
`Proxy`: no
