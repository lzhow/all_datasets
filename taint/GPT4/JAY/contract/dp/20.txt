The contract state `nftsSold` is data dependent on the variable `total` in the function `buyJay`. In the `buyJay` function, `total` is calculated based on the length of the `erc721TokenAddress` array and potentially increased by the return value of `buyJayWithERC1155`. This `total` variable is then used to calculate the amount of ETH required for the transaction and the amount of JAY tokens to mint. At the end of the `buyJay` function, `nftsSold` is incremented by the value of `total`, which establishes a direct data dependency between `nftsSold` and `total`.
