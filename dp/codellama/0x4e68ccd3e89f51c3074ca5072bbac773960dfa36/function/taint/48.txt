  
No, the ` quotinent_ scope_ 1` variable in get NextSQRTPrice FromAmount  is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined within the scope of the getnextSquareRootPricefromAmount function.

The variable is assigned a value based on the input parameters of `sqrtPrice`, `liquity`, and `amount`, but it does not depend on any user input. Therefore, this variable cannot be controlled directly by a user, and its value is determined by internal logic within this function only.
