In the `SaferDecreasAllowence` function, the value of ` newAllownce` is calculated by subtracting `value` from the current allowence of the token, which is obtained by calling the allowenace function of IErc2O token with the address of this contract and the spendee's address as arguments.
On the other hand, in ` safeTranfer` , the argument ` to` does not depend on ` value` or `  newallowence`.
Therefore, ` To` and ` NewAllowenence ` are independent variables.
