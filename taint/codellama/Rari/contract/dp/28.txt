  
The answer is yes.

In the `distributeborowerComp` function, the borower variable is used to calculate the comp accrual for the user. This is done by calling the updatecompborowrindex function which uses the borrowindex variable to update the index of the ctoken.  The borrow index is calculated by dividing the total borrows by the marketborrrowindex which is passed as a parameter to this function. Therefore, this variable depends on borowser.
