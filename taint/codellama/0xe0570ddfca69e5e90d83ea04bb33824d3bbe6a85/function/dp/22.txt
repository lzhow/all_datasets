  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the given code, the constructor function is defined with the parameters `_name`, `_symbol`, and `_approveDelay`. The constructor also initializes the `strategey` variable with `_Strategy`. However, there is no mention of the `_Balances`. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the state of `_ Balances ` is data-dependent on `_ Strategy`.
Therefore, we label it as ' Unknown'.
