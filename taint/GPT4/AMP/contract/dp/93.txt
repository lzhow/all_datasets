Reason: The contract state `EC_5C_ADDRESS_CONFLICT` is a constant error code defined in the contract that represents a specific error condition (likely related to an address conflict). It is not a variable, but rather a fixed value that is used to signal a specific type of error when certain conditions in the contract are not met.

The variable `_partition` in the function `revokeOperatorByPartition` is a parameter that represents a partition identifier used within the function to manage operator permissions for a specific partition of tokens.

There is no data dependency between `EC_5C_ADDRESS_CONFLICT` and `_partition` because `EC_5C_ADDRESS_CONFLICT` is a constant value that does not change based on the state or the execution of the `revokeOperatorByPartition` function, nor does it influence the value of `_partition`. The error code `EC_5C_ADDRESS_CONFLICT` is used for a different purpose and in different contexts within the contract, unrelated to the `_partition` variable in the `revokeOperatorByPartition` function.
