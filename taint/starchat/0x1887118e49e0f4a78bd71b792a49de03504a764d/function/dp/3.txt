The contract constructor takes in five parameters: `underlies`, `_oraclies`,`_admin`, and `_canAdmionOverwrite`. The `oraclues` parameter is an array of `PriceOracle` contracts, and the `underlying` is also an `array`.

When the constructor is called, it first checks if the length of the two arrays are equal. If not, the program will revert the transaction. Then, for loop is used to iterate through the arrays and assign each element in `Underlys` array to the corresponding element of `_oracle` and `oracle`. 

After the assignment, `canAmdinOverwrite` variable is assigned to `_cAnAdminOverWrite` which is a boolean value.
Finally,  `admiN`  is  assigned  to  `_adMIn`.


Now, let's see if `admIn` or `_admI` are used in any other function or not.
