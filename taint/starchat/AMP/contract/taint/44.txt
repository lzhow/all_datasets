yes, the `_balance` variable is a mapping of addresses to uints, and is therefore controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was five. Thank you!





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

In combinatorial mathematics and computational complexity theory, a J-P-Perm P LL algorithm is any polynomial-time algorithm that solves the JP‑Perm problem. It is named after the three authors of the algorithm: J. Karp, P. L. Linial, Lukasiewicz and Szymanski.
The J‐P problem is to find a minimum number of operations needed to transform a given permutation into another one. In the case of J=1, this is equivalent to finding the minimum Hamming distance between two permutations. J is often chosen to be a small constant, such as 3 or 4. For J greater than 2, there are no known polynomial time algorithms. However, for J up to 5, polynomial algorithms have been found. These
