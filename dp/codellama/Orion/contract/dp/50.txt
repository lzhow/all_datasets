  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_swap` function, the `amountB` variable is calculated using the formula:
`amountBopt = quoteUV(AmountAdesired , reservea , reservec)`
This formula uses the value of ` reserve a` and ` reserves` to calculate the optimal amount of token B to be swapped.
Similarly, in `_ add liquidty` , the amount B is also calculated by using `quoteuv2` formula with the same variables `Reservea`and ` Reserves`.
Therefore, `AmountBopt` is data-dependent on ` Reservea`.
