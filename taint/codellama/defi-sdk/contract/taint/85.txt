  
No, the `isUHashed` variable in function `IsHashused` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a private variable and it can only be accessed by internal functions.

The `markHashUse` function can set the value of `hasUhashed_` to true, but it cannot be set by any external function. Therefore, `HasUshed _` cannot  be controlled directly by a user, and the analysis is 'No'.
