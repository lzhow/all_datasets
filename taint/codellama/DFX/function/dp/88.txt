  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `Curves` contract is called to transfer funds from the current contract to the recipient. This transfer is done using the `_recipent` and `_amount` parameters passed to this function.
Since the transfer function is not dependent on any other state of the original contract, it is safe to say that the state is independent of `sucess_`.
Therefore, we label the relationship between the two as 'NO'.
