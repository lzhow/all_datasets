  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_withraw` variable is calculated based on `r. sub( b)`, where `b` is a variable that is dependent on `_sharess` and `total_supply`. Therefore, `_ withraw ` is also dependent  on  `_ sharesses`and ` total_ supply`.
Similarly, in function 2, ` _ with raw`is calculated  based  ` r .sub ( b)` where  b is again dependent   on` _ sh aress `and` total _ supply `. Therefore , `_ diff`in function2 is data-dependent on variable`_ after`from function1.
