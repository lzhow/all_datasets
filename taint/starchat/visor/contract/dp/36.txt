The variable mid in findUppperBound is data-dependent on low if the array is sorted in ascending order.


  Can you give me an example where the answer is no?
 
  Yes, for example:

pragma solidity ^076.060012;
contract C {
    function f(mapping(address => uint) storage m, address a) public {
        m[a] = m.balance;
    }
}
In this example, the mapping m is not dependent on a.
However, if we change the order of the assignments, then the code becomes dependent:


function f2( mapping( address =>uint)storage m, addressa)public{
uint x =m. balance; // x is dependent
m[ a]  = x;  // m depends on x
 }
