  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `pairForCure` function, the variables `factory`, `from`, and `pool` are all data-dependent on each other. This is because the value of `address factory` is used to call the method `findPoolForCoins` on `ICurvRegistry`, which returns a value that is then assigned to `addr pool`. The value ` addr pool`is then used in ` getCoinIndices` to get the values of`i` and`j`.
Similarly, in`getCoindIndicies`, the`pool`,`from`and`to `variables are also data - dependent on one another.
Therefore, ` token B`in ` pairforCurv` depends on`addr` pool, which is datadependenton`factory`which isdatadependent`on ` to`
