  
No. These two code snippets are NOT sematically equal because of the difference in the line `if ( first < ( upper-1 ) )`. In the original code, it checks if `first` less than `upper-  `1``, while in mutated code it is checking if first less then `(upper--)-1`. This difference will affect how the code behaves.
