Label: no

Reason: The variable `numerator` in the function `_mintFee` is calculated within its own function scope and depends on the variables `totalSupply`, `rootK`, and `rootKLast`, which are derived from `_reserve0`, `_reserve1`, and `kLast`. The variable `to` in the function `swap` is a parameter that specifies the recipient address for the output amounts of a token swap operation. There is no direct relationship or data flow between the `numerator` variable in `_mintFee` and the `to` variable in `swap`. The `numerator` calculation is independent of the swap operation and the `to` variable, as it is concerned with fee calculation and not with the transfer of tokens. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `numerator` and `to`.
