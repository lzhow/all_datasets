Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_owner` is not explicitly referenced in the function `withdrawReserve`. The function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier, which implies that there is a check to ensure that the caller of the function is the owner of the contract. However, this check does not create a data dependency between `_owner` and `_token` because `_owner` is likely a state variable that holds the address of the owner, and it is used to control access rather than to influence the computation or the logic that depends on the `_token` variable. The `_token` variable is used to interact with the ERC20 token contract and to manage the pool reserves, which are separate concerns from the ownership check. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between `_owner` and `_token` within the `withdrawReserve` function.
