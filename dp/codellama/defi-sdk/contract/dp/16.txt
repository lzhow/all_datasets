  
No, the variables `input` and `output` are passed as arguments to the `handleETCInput` function, but they do not have any data dependencies with the local variable amount.

The `execute` method calls the`handleInput `method, which takes the input token and amount as parameters. However, these parameters are only used to determine the amount of tokens to transfer from the caller to this contract. They are then passed to `SaferC.2C` to perform the actual transfer. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two methods.
