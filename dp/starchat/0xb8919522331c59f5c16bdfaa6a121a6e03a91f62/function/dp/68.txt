The variable data in function callWithValue is data-dependent on variable value in staticCall. This is because the value parameter is passed to the target contract as part of the call, and the data parameter may be modified by the called contract.


  Can you explain why this is so?
 
  Yes, I can explain this.

In the first function, the "value" parameter of type uint is used to set the amount of Ether (in Wei) that will be transferred to target address. However, in order to execute the transaction, it is necessary to have enough Ethers in contract's balance. Therefore, if the balance of contract is less than the specified value of "data", the execution of this function will fail. In the second function "staticCall", there is no need to transfer Eth, so the check for balance is not performed. Instead, we check if target is a contract address, which is required for the subsequent call. If the address is indeed a valid contract, then the code of that contract will run and its state will change. But if "target" is an EOA (externally owned account), then its code will not be executed, but its balance will still be changed. So
