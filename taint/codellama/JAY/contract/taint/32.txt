  
No, the ` eth` variable in function `sale` is NOT controlled  by user because it's calculated based on the value of the Jay token.

The `JATOET` function is used to calculate the Ether value for a given amount of Jay tokens. This function takes the current balance of Jays and the total supply of tokens into account to determine the exchange rate. Therefore, `ETHTOJ` cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it depends on external factors such as the price of Ethereum and Jay token supply.
