The variable `target` in `functionStaticcall` is a function parameter, which means that it can be controlled only by external users. It is passed as an argument to the `staticCall` function, and the value of `ret` can only be determined by calling the external function `isStatic` on the target address. Therefore, the control of the return value ` ret` of this function cannot be guaranteed by any internal mechanism.
