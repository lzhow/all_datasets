The variable `liquidity` in the function `burn` is data dependent on the variable `balance0` in the same function. This is because `liquidity` is used to calculate `amount0`, which is then used to determine the new value of `balance0` after the burning process. The calculation of `amount0` is directly influenced by the value of `liquidity`, as shown in the following line of code within the `burn` function:

```solidity
amount0 = liquidity.mul(balance0) / _totalSupply;
```

Here, `amount0` is calculated by multiplying `liquidity` by `balance0` and then dividing by `_totalSupply`. Since `amount0` represents the amount of token0 that will be sent to the address `to`, it affects the subsequent calculation of the new `balance0` after the transfer:

```solidity
_safeTransfer(_token0, to, amount0);
balance0 = IERC20(_token0).balanceOf(address(this));
```

After the `_safeTransfer` call, `balance0` is updated to reflect the new balance of token0 in the contract, which has been decreased by the amount `amount0`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `liquidity` and `balance0` within the `burn` function.
