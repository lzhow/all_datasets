  
No, the `_ amount` variable in accumulatedAlphaUser function in EscroAlpha contract is NOT controlled  by user because it comes from a trusted source, which is alpha token contract.

The function `accumulatealphaTouser` in `Escrowalpha` contract takes in two parameters, `_user`, and `_amout`. The `_ amout` parameter is passed from `alpha token`contarct, and it's not possible for the `user to control the amount of alpha tokens that are transferred to `escrow alpha` contrat. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled from an external source.
