yes

The variable `length` is directly assigned the value of `pairs.length`, which means that `length` is dependent on the size of the array `pairs`. The relationship is established by the line `uint256 length = pairs.length;` within the function `callBytes`. Therefore, any changes to the `pairs` array will affect the value of `length`, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
