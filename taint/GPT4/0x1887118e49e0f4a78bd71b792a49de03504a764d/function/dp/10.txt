Reason: The variable `underlyings` in the constructor is used to initialize the `oracles` mapping with the corresponding `PriceOracle` instances from the `_oracles` array. The variable `newAdmin` in the function `changeAdmin` is used to update the `admin` state variable of the contract. There is no code indicating that `underlyings` has any influence on `newAdmin` or vice versa. They are used in completely separate contexts within the contract: `underlyings` is used for setting up the `oracles` mapping during contract initialization, while `newAdmin` is used for changing the contract's administrator at a later point. There is no data flow or dependency between these two variables.
