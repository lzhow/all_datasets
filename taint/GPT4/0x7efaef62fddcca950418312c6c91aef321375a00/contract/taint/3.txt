The variable `to` in the function `swap` is an argument provided by the caller of the function. Since the function `swap` is an external function, it can be called by anyone on the blockchain, including users. Therefore, the value of `to` is controlled by the user who invokes the `swap` function, as they can specify any address they wish as the destination for the tokens being swapped.
