The above provided codes in both Java and C are syntactically correct and can be compiled and executed successfully. However, semantic analysis of these codes must be done to determine if there is any change in the code's behavior, output, or efficiency, given changes to the original code.

In this example, the semantic difference between the provided Java code and its mutant counterpart is the additional "++" operation on the line containing "%6s" in "Mutated Code" block. This is an invalid increment operation in Java, and will result in a compilation error. Therefore, "yes" must always be answered for this code example.
