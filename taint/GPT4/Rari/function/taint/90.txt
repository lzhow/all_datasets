The variable `a` in the function `sub_` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `a` is a parameter of the function `sub_`, which means its value is passed as an argument when the function is called. The value of `a` is determined by the caller of the function, not the user. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
