Label: no

Reason: In the function `functionStaticCall`, the variable `data` is used as an argument to the `staticcall` function, which is a low-level call to the address specified by the variable `target`. The `data` variable contains the calldata that is sent to the `target` address. The `target` variable represents the address of the contract being called, and it does not influence the content of the `data` variable. The `data` is passed through to the `staticcall` function without being modified by the `target`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `data` and `target` within the `functionStaticCall` function; they are independent parameters used in the call to another contract.
