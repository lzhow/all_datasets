The two provided codes do not have semantic equivalence. The first code adds the value of `number` to the last position of the array `a` if ` number` is greater than or equal to ` end`. The second code does the exact same thing, except it increments ` a`s last element by 1. Although these two snippets of code achieve the desired result, the added complexity in the second snippet means the meaning of each line of logic is now dependent on the previous lines of execution, making it difficult to determine if two programs are truly equivalent.

In short, while the code snippets are syntactically and semanticall equal, they do have different meanings and outputs, and are therefore not semantic equivalent in this case.
