The variable `marketplaceFeeAmount` in the function `emitExecuted` is data dependent on the variable `output` in the same function. The reason for this is that `marketplaceFeeAmount` is calculated in the `execute` function, which is called before `emitExecuted`. The calculation of `marketplaceFeeAmount` involves the `output` variable, specifically `output.absoluteAmount` and `output.token`, as part of the calculation in the `getReturnedAmounts` function. This function uses `output.absoluteAmount` to determine the `returnedAmount`, which in turn is used to calculate the `marketplaceFeeAmount`. Since `marketplaceFeeAmount` is derived from calculations that include `output`, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
