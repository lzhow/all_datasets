Reason: In the function `functionDelegateCall`, the variable `success` is set as a result of the `delegatecall` operation, which takes the variable `data` as an input parameter. The `delegatecall` is a low-level call that executes the code at the target address with the provided input data (`data`) in the context of the calling contract's state. The success of this call, and thus the value of the `success` variable, is directly dependent on the input data provided. If the input data (`data`) leads to a successful execution of the code at the target address, `success` will be `true`; otherwise, it will be `false`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `success` and `data` within the `functionDelegateCall` function.
