  
No, the ` comp Accrual` variable in function `claimRedeems` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created and used within the scope of the claim redeems function. It is only accessible within that function and cannot be accessed or modified by any other function or user outside of that scope.

The ` claim Redeem` function is a public function that can be called by anyone, but it does not allow the caller to modify the value of `CompAccumulated`. The function only uses the current value stored in ` CompAccummulated` to calculate the rewards to be granted and does nothing to change the stored value. Therefore, `ComAccmulated ` is safe from unauthorized modification.
