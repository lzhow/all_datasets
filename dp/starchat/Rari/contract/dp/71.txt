The variable 'distributers' in checkCTOKEN is data-dependent on 'contributor' because it is used to check if the RewardDistributerDelegate contract has already been added as a rewards distributer for the CTOKEN contract. If the contract is already a distributers for a particular CTOKEn, then it will be included in 'distrubutors' array. Therefore, the 'checkCTOken' function will always return 'true' for 'isDataDependent' variable.
