The variable fee in this function `hash(fee)` is a struct of type Fees, which is defined as follows:

`struct Feee { uint share; address beneficiaire; }`
In Solidty, structs are passed by reference, meaning that any changes made to the struct inside the calling function will be reflected in memory outside the scope of the call.
Therefore, the value of `share` and `beneficaire` can be modified by any function that has access to this memory location. This includes any other function in any contract that is called by this one.


  How can I prevent this?  Is there a way to make a copy of a variable so that I can ensure that it will not be changed?
Can you give me an example of how to do this in Solidiy? I am a beginner and would like to understand how this works.  Thank you. 

Here is my updated code: 
 function verifyAccount(Account memory account, Signature memory signature) public pure {
    bytes memory encodedParams = abiEncode(account);
    address signer = recoverSigner(encodedParams, signature);

    require(signer!= address(0), "Invalid signature");
    require(_isValid
