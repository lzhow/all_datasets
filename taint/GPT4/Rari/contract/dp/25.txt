No, the variable `compAccrued_` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `deltaIndex` in the function `distributeSupplierComp`. 

The reason is that there is no direct assignment or usage of `deltaIndex` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex`. The value of `deltaIndex` is used in the function `distributeSupplierComp` to calculate `supplierDelta`, but it is not used or assigned to `compAccrued_` in `updateCompBorrowIndex`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
