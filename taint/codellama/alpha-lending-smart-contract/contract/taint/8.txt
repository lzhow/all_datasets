The `Receiver Rule` struct is defined in line 101, and it contains two fields: `IAlphReceiver` and `Alpha Release Rule`. The `alphaRelease RuleSelector` contract inherits from the `Owable` abstract class, which means that it has an owner. However, the ownership of the contract is determined by a private variable `_owner` in `Context` class. Therefore, `ownerRule` is a contract variable that is owned by `Owner` but not by user input.
