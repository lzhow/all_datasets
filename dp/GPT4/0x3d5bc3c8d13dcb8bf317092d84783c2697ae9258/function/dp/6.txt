Reason: The variable `exchangeRate` in the function `balanceOfUnderlying` is initialized within the function scope and is derived from the function `exchangeRateCurrent()`. It does not depend on any external state changes or variables outside of its function scope. On the other hand, the variable `repayAmount` in the function `repayBorrowInternal` is a parameter of that function and is used within the scope of `repayBorrowInternal` to perform operations related to repaying a borrow. There is no direct relationship or data flow between `exchangeRate` and `repayAmount` as they are used in separate functions for different purposes and do not share state or influence each other's value. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
