Reason: The variable `_totalSupply` in the `mint` function is used to calculate the amount of liquidity that will be minted based on the current total supply of the liquidity tokens. It is assigned from the `totalSupply` state variable, which represents the total supply of the liquidity tokens at the time the `mint` function is called.

On the other hand, the variable `balance1` in the `burn` function represents the balance of `token1` held by the contract at the time the `burn` function is called. It is used to calculate the amount of `token1` that will be returned to the user when they burn their liquidity tokens.

The two variables, `_totalSupply` in `mint` and `balance1` in `burn`, operate independently in their respective functions. The value of `_totalSupply` does not depend on the value of `balance1`, nor does the calculation of `balance1` in the `burn` function have any impact on `_totalSupply` in the `mint` function. They are related to different operations (minting and burning of liquidity tokens) and do not share a direct data dependency relationship.
