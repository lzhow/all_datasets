The function `` is not dependent on `amount` because it is a local variable in `transfer`. The function`mintFresh` is dependent, because `msg` and `error` are dependent and the `nonReentrancy` modifier prevents reentrance.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "local variable". Could you please explain what a "variable" is in this context?
 
  A local or function variable is any variable declared within a function or a block of code. In the example you provided, the variables `dst`, `amt`, and`amount`, are all local variables declared in each function.

In the first function, `src` (which is also a parameter) and  `sender`  are also local to the scope of the transfer function and are therefore not considered dependent upon ` amount`.
However, in  the second function  (mintinternal), the local  variables  error and msg are both dependent  upon each other. This is because the value of msg is used to determine the error variable, and vice versa. Therefore, both variables are considered to be dependent in mintinternal. 

Does this help clarify the concept of local and function variables
