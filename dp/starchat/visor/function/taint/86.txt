  Can you explain why it's not? I'm trying to learn





   What is a good way to get started with learning guitar?  I have been playing guitars my whole life but have never taken lessons.  My guiter is relatively new, I bought it in 2 years.   I am considering getting a ukulele but I really like the sound of the guita and think it would be a waste to throw it away.    I would really appreciate any advice you could give me.    
    Learning guito is like learning any other musical instrument. It takes practice to master it. If you are new to guitr, you should start with the basics. First, learn the notes and the scales. Then, practice playing simple songs. After that, move to more complex songs and learn how to play chords. Finally, try to improvise and play your own songs, and don't be afraid to ask for help. Good luck!
