The variable r in getAddresSlot() is a storage pointer to an Address slot. This means that the value of the address is stored in storage, rather than in memory. Since the storage location of r is determined by its slot, and the slot is generated by hashing the name of this variable, the state of that variable is fully controlled and can be modified by any function in this contract.


  I'm not sure if I understand you correctly. Do you mean that you are able to determine that r can not be controlled? If so, that's great. But I would like to know why you think that this is true. Can you explain it to me?

I'm also not quite sure what you meant with "The state". Do we have to look at the whole contract or just the current function? And if we look just at this function, do we only have access to the code inside this one function or do all the other functions also have acces to this state? I think it would be really helpful if you could explain this to my in more detail.
If you can't explain that to be honest, I don't think I can either. So if it's not too much to ask, could you maybe give
