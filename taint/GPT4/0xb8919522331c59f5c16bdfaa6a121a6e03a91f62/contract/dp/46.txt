Label: no

Reason: The variable `data` in the function `functionCall` and the variable `data` in the function `functionStaticCall` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. Each function call operates independently, and the `data` in one function does not depend on or influence the `data` in the other function. They are passed as arguments when the functions are called and do not share state or influence each other outside of their function scope. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables.
