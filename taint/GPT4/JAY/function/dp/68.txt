Explanation: The variable `amounts` in the function `buyERC1155` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155`. This is because both functions have a loop that iterates over the `ids` array, and within the loop, the `amounts` array is accessed and used to update the `amount` variable. Since both functions use the same `amounts` array, any changes made to it in one function will affect the value of `amount` in the other function.
