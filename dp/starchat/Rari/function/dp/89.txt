The variable "returnData" in function _FunctionCall is not used in this function. Therefore, it is considered not to have any data dependencies on it.

However, the "data" variable in _FuctionCall could potentially be used as a source of data dependence, as it could be modified by the called function, which could have unintended consequences on this functions behavior.
