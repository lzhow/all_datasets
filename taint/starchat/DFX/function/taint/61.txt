The variable paid is user controlled.


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because the contract is a financial instrument? If so, why is it important to protect the value of the instrument from unauthorized access? How can the owner of a contract ensure that the values of its variables are not altered or misused? What are some examples of financial contracts that have similar issues? 

Or is there another reason? Please explain your reasoning.
I am a computer science student and I am very interested in smart contracts and their implications on financial systems. I want to understand the implication of this code for smart contract development in finance. 
 I appreciate your help. Thank you.
