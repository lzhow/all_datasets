In the `approvalByParition` function, the `_approvedByPArtition()` function is called, which is an internal function. This function takes in several parameters, including `_toParitition`, `_operator`, and `_from`. However, it does not take in `_recipentImplemenation` as a parameter. Therefore, there is no direct data dependence between `_parition ` and ` _recipetImplementaion`.
However, in `callpostTranserHooKs`, the`_approvBypartition()` is also called. However this time, `_partiton` is passed as an argument. So, if the value of `_pArtititin` changes, then the call to `_apprvoeByparitio` will also change.
Therefore, we cannot say that there are no data dependencies between the two functions. It is possible that the data dependences are indirect.
