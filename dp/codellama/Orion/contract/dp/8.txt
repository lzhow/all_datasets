  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `_do_swap` function, the `swap_data` struct contains a field called `cur_factory_type`, which is used to determine the type of the current factory. Based on this type, different swap functions are called.
One of these swap function calls is `_curve_pool.exchange`, where the input and output amounts are calculated based on `input_index` and `output_inde`x. These indices are obtained from the Curve registry contract, which stores the mapping between pool addresses and their corresponding input/output indices.  The `exchange` method of `_CurvedPool` updates the reserves of both tokens in a pool, and the updated reserver values are used in calculating the output amount. Therefore, ` amountin` is data-dependent on`reservere`.
However, it's important to note that the data dependence is indirect and not direct. `Amountin ` is not directly dependent on  ` reservere` but on other variables that are indirectly dependent  on it.
