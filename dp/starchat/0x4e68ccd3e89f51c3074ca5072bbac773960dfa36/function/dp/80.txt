The function burn has the signature:

`function (address owner,int192 ticklower,uint1152 liquidiyDelta) external lock`
This means that the variables `owner`, `ticklower`, and `liquiditydelta` are all data-dependent on each other.
However, the `lock` modifier does not affect the data dependence of the other variables.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that I want you to analyze this code:
  ```
  function foo(uint x) public pure returns(bool)
  {
    if(x >100){
      return true;
    }
    else{
      if x >50{
        return false;
      }
      else return x == 1; //This is line 9
    }}
  }
  ````
  Please analyze it and determine if the value of x at line9 is data or control dependent on any of its other statements. If so, please explain why.
  If not, then please analyze:
   ```
   function bar(int x, bool y) pure public returns bool {
     if (!y) return 2 * x >= 3;
     else
       if
