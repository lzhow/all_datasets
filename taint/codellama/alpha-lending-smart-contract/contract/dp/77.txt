In the `setPool` function, the `_totalSharess` variable is assigned to the pool's `totalborrows` and `totalsupply` variables.
Then, in `calculateRoundedDownSharingAmount`, the totalborrower variable and the amount variable are used to calculate the rounded down liquidity share amount.  The `amount variable` is also used in other functions such as `burnAltoken` to burn the altoken. Therefore, `_ amount`is data-dependent on `pools`.
