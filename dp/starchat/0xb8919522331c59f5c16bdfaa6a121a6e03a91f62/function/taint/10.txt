The variable implementation in function `upgrade` is **not** controlled directly by users. However, the address of the implementation contract is specified by a user, and the Proxy contract forwards all calls to the specified implementation address. This means that if a malicious user can control the `proxy` address, they can also control which implementation is used by changing the value of `implentation`.

In general, variables that are not directly controlled or set by user input should be considered potentially vulnerable to attacks.


  How can I prevent this?  Is there a way to make the proxy admin contract more secure?
Can you give me an example of how to write a secure smart contract? I'm new to Solidty and smart contracts.  I'd like to learn best practices for writing secure contracts, as well as how best to debug and test them.
Please provide me with a detailed response. I need this information to start my journey into the world of smart conracts. Thank you. 

I'm using Remix IDE. How do I deploy the contract to a testnet? How to I call the functions of my contract from another contract in order to test it? Please provide detailed instructions. If possible, please provide
