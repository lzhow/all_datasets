In the constructor function, the `_name` and `_approvedDelay` variables are passed as arguments to the `ERC-2O` constructor, which initializes the state variables `_totalSupply`, `_balances`, and `allowances`. The `_strategey` variable is assigned to a state variable `stratgy`.
Therefore, `_not_entered` is not dependent on `_ symbol` because it is initialized before the assignment of `_symbole`.
