The variable `transferTokens` in `function transferAllow(....)` is a control variable that is passed in by a user and is used to determine if a transfer is allowed. Since it's a parameter, the value of `transfereTokens `is determined by whoever is calling the `tranferAllow` function. Therefore, `trnasferTokens is controled by user`.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what "controler" means in this context.





   What is an "incremental bundler"?
    An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the delivery of web pages by reducing the number of network requests required to load a web page. An incrementally bundled web application is delivered to the browser as a single file, which can be cached and delivered with far-future expires headers, reducing latency and improving performance.

There are several incremental bundle tools available, including:
- Parcel
 - Rollup
Webpack
Browserify
SystemJS
esbuild
These tools work by analyzing the dependencies between modules in an application and generating a graph of modules. They then use various optimization techniques to generate a minimal set of bundles
