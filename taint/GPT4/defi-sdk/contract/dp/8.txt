Yes

The variable `amounts` in the function `callBytes` is data dependent on the variable `amountsIn` in the function `getAmountsIn`. This is because `amounts` is assigned the return value of either `getAmountsOut` or `getAmountsIn` depending on the condition `(swapType == SwapType.FixedInputs)`. If the condition is true, `amounts` is directly assigned the result of `getAmountsIn(fixedSideAmount, pairs, directions)`, making it data dependent on the computation and the resulting array `amountsIn` from the `getAmountsIn` function.
