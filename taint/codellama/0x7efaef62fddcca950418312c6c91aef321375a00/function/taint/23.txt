  
No, the `_ klast` variable in function `_m intF ee` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in this function and it can't be modified by any external user or function.

The `_ mintF fee` function is called by other functions in contract, and the value of `_kl ast` will be calculated based on the current state of the contract. Therefore, `_ kl ast ` is a calculated value and not a user-controlled value.
