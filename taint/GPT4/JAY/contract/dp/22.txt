Yes

The contract state `nftsSold` is data dependent on the variable `erc721TokenAddress` in the function `buyJay`. The reason for this is that within the `buyJay` function, the length of the `erc721TokenAddress` array is used to determine the `total` number of NFTs being processed for the purchase. This `total` is then used in the calculation of the `msg.value` required for the transaction and subsequently affects the `_mint` function call, which mints new tokens based on the ETH value sent to the contract.

Furthermore, the `total` variable, which includes the count of ERC721 tokens from `erc721TokenAddress`, is added to the `nftsSold` state variable towards the end of the `buyJay` function:

```solidity
nftsSold += total;
```

This line directly updates the `nftsSold` state variable based on the `total`, which includes the count of ERC721 tokens derived from `erc721TokenAddress`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `nftsSold` and `erc721TokenAddress` within the `buyJay` function.
