The variable `_newShells` in the function `viewProportionalDeposit` is data dependent on the variable `balances_` in the function `getGrossLiquidityAndBalancesForDeposit`.

Explanation: The variable `_newShells` is assigned the value of the variable `_deposit` in the `viewProportionalDeposit` function. The value of `_deposit` is then used to calculate `_newShells` by performing mathematical operations involving the variable `_totalShells`, which is obtained from the `getGrossLiquidityAndBalancesForDeposit` function. Since the value of `_newShells` depends on the value of `balances_`, there is a data dependency between these two variables. Therefore, the label for their data dependency relationship is 'yes'.
