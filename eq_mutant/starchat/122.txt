No. While the original code and mutant code are both functions that take in a double as input, and return a new double, they do not have exactly the *same* behavior. There are multiple errors in the mutated code that can be detected through static analysis. For example:
1. In the last if statement, there is a bug that will increase the bonus amount by 4% per year, regardless of what value is passed in. This is because Java increments the value after the condition check, rather than before. Therefore if I pass in 99 887 766 as the input value, it will actually evaluate to 50 693 E+649 for the if condition, which would cause the calculation to be wrong. 
2. Furthermore, because I can only input doubles, but not ints, this could also result in infinite loops because int values are able to become double types after a certain value. If I input  -1e18 as a value (which I am assuming would result an an int), it is still a negative value in Java, so it would then continue to calculate, resulting in an infinite loop. Although this is technically a different bug than the
