In the constructor function, the `ERC-2O` contract is initialized with the name and symbol parameters. This initialization sets the contract's name, which is a state variable.
Then, in `_setupDecimal`, the decimation parameter is used to set the number of decisions.  This function is called after the ER-C 2 O contract has been initialized. Therefore, ` decims` is data-dependent on ` name` because it is set after `  name ` is.
