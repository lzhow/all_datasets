This is the source code for Quicksort in both C and Java, which are both object-oriented programming languages. While the syntax and basic structure of these programs are similar, they differ in several key ways:

- The function definitions are slightly different between C (without parameter types) and C++. C++ includes type information for functions, while C does not
C++
```c++:quicksort.cpp:
    // This function uses the partition scheme described above to sort an
    /* arr[] : Array to be sorted,
    low  : Starting index, 
    high : Ending index */
    void Quick_Sort(int arr[], int low,int high)
    {
        if(low < high){
            int pi = partition(arr,low,high);
            Quick( arr, low, pi-1);  // Recursively sort elements before partition
            Quic( ar, pi+1, high); // recursively sort after partition
        }
    }
Java
public void Sort(String[] arr){
    QuickSrt(ar,0 ar.Length-2);
}
static void Quciksort2(Comparable[] a, in r, fin l){ // 4-way quick sort
