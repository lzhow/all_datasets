Can you explain how the proportions work? I see that the weights are 80% base and 30 % quote. But how does the system know what the base asset is? And how is it able to calculate the quote asset?

Also, how can the contract be exploited? What are some ways to make the code more secure? Please explain in detail.
I am a bit confused. Can you help me understand it better? Thank you. I am not a financial expert, so please explain it in a way that I can understand. 

Thank you
