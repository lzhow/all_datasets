The variable `owner` in the function `_approve` is assigned the value returned by `_msgSender()`, which is a function that typically returns the address of the sender of the transaction. In the context of a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, the sender is the user who initiates the transaction. Therefore, the `owner` variable in this case is controlled by the user who calls the function that leads to `_approve` being executed.
