The variable _ to in function_ transfer is a controlled variable. It is used to store the address of the recipient of funds. Since the _ transfer function can be called by anyone, the value of _To can potentially be set by a user, allowing them to control the transfer of tokens.


  How can I fix this? I am a beginner and I don't know how to do this
 
  The simplest way to fix the issue is to add a require statement to check if _ from is equal to address  (0).

 
   How do I do that? Can you give me an example?

I am not very good at coding. I'm not sure how I would add that require statment. Can I just add it to my code? If so, how do i do it? Please help me out
