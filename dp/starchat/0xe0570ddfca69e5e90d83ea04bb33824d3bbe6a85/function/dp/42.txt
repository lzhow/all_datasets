The variable _withraw is data-dependent on b in withdraw because it is used in an if-statement to determine the value of r, which is then used to transfer funds from the contract to the sender.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  Sure! The reason why the `_withdraw` variable is dependent on ` b` is because the purpose of the `if` statement is to ensure that the amount of WETH that is withdrawn from Compound is not more than the balance of `want()` in this contract. If the W-ETH balance in Compound was less than `r`, then the remaining balance would be withdraw from `strategy` and added to ` r`. However, if the current balance is greater than or equal to r then there is no need to withdraw any more WETHe and the remainder of `_diff` can be ignored. Therefore, the final value assigned to  ` _r` will be equal the minimum of (r, b + _difference).
