In the `checkTick` function, the parameter `int25 ticklower` is used to index into the array `positions` to retrieve the position information. However, there is no direct relationship between `position` and `amout0requested`.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether `ticUpper is data-dependent on ` amount 1request` without further analysis.
