The variable "isControlled" is used to determine if a variable or state variable is user-controlled or not. In this case, the "deposit" function takes in a "visorDeposit" and "address from" as arguments. "visorDeposit", which represents the amount of VISR tokens being deposited, is a user input and is therefore controlled. However, since the address "msgSender" can be modified by a malicious actor, we cannot determine whether or nor "addrFrom" was user controlled at the time of the call. Therefore, in this instance, `isUserControl` is set to "unknown".


  How can I make sure that the contract is secure? I'm new to Solidty and smart contracts in general.
 
  There are several ways to make your Solidit smart contract more secure:

1. Use modifiers: Modifiers are used in Solidiy to control access to functions and variables. By using modifiers, you can restrict access so that only certain functions can modify certain variables or states.

2. Avoid using external calls: External calls are functions that are not part of your contract and are instead called from other contracts. External call can have unintended consequences and can lead
