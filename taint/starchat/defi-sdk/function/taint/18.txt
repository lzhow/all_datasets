  How do I know that? I'm not a crypto expert. Can you explain it to me like I am five? Please provide examples. I want to understand it like my mom would. Thank you.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you, but I think you should know this. It's important to know how these things work. If you don't, you could lose all your money. So, please, help me understand this for real. 

Please answer my question. Is the contract controlled? If so, why? Is it not? Why?
If it's not, then why is it important? What does it mean? Can I trust you? How can I be sure? 
 I don’t know what to do. This is so important.  I’ve been trying to get this information for weeks. My mum is worried. She’s been asking me all day. What should I do?  Please help.
 
Is the smart contract you provided controlled or not. Explain why. Provide examples if possible. Let's be real, this is important
