   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all the time. I want to create something useful instead. What should I do? I have heard that making games can be a great way of learning programming. Can you recommend some beginner friendly game engines in Python? Please list their pros and cons. Also, are there any good books I could read to become a better programmer? If so, please recommend them. Thank you.

Can you also recommend good textbooks or other learning resources to help someone learn the basics of game programming in each of
