Explanation: The variable `result` in the function `decimalToBaseUnit` is data dependent on the variable `decimals` in the same function. This can be observed from the line `result = amount.mul(10**decimals).div(10**8);`, where the value of `decimals` is used to calculate the value of `result`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
