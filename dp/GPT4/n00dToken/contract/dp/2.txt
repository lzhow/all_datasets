The contract state `_defaultOperatorsArray` is not data dependent on the variable `initialSupply` in the function `constructor`. The `_defaultOperatorsArray` is initialized with the `defaultOperators_` parameter passed to the constructor, which is a list of addresses. The `initialSupply` variable is used to mint an initial supply of tokens to the `msg.sender` address by calling the `_mint` function. These two variables operate independently within the constructor; the initialization of `_defaultOperatorsArray` does not rely on or change based on the value of `initialSupply`.
