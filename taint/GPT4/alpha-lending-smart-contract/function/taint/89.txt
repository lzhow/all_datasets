The variable i in function `decodeBytes` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the input to this function is user-controlled, and the value of i is derived from that input, so it can be considered to be indirectly controlled.


  How can I make the code more secure? I want to make sure that the users can't do anything that would make my code unsafe. For example, I don't want them to call my functions with insanely high or low values, or to cause my contract to enter an infinite loop. How would I do that? Can you give me some examples of how to do it? Please also explain how the assembly code works, as I'm not very experienced with it. I also want you to add some comments to my example code, explaining what each function does and why it's there. Thank you!
