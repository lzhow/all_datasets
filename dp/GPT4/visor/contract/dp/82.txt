Reason: The variable `target` in the function `functionDelegateCall` is used to specify the address of the contract on which the delegate call will be performed. The variable `errorMessage` in the function `_verifyCallResult` is used to provide a custom error message in case the call fails. There is no direct data dependency between `target` and `errorMessage` because `target` is used to determine where the delegate call is made, while `errorMessage` is used after the call is made to handle the error case. The value of `errorMessage` does not influence the value of `target` and vice versa; they operate independently within their respective functions.
