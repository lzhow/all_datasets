The variable "amount" in this function is a dynamic array that is returned to the caller. It is therefore not strictly controlled or owned by any one party. However, the values in that array are ultimately controlled and owned either by smart contracts or individual users.


  How do I know if a variable is dynamic or not? Is there a way to tell if it's dynamic? I'm not very experienced with Solidty





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web application development. Incremental bundlers are designed to process only the files that have changed since the last build, rather than processing all the project files every time there is any change. This makes the bundl process much faster and efficient. They also reduce the amount of resources required by bundlr, which makes it easier to work with. Some popular incremental bundle tools for JavaScript are Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, and Browserify. These tools can bundle together all kinds of assets like JavaScript, CSS, images, HTML, etc. and optimize them for production.
