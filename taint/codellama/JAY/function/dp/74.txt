In the `function` buy Jay, the local variable success is defined as a parameter of the call function. This means that the value of success in this function is determined by the return value from the external call.
On the other hand, in `the function` ` buy J`ay `No` NFT, success does not have any external dependencies. It is a local function variable that is assigned a value based on a comparison between the message value and the minimum value. Therefore, ` success` is not dependent on `Success` from `Buy Jay`.
