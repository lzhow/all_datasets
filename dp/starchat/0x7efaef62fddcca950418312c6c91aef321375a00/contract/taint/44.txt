yes, time elapsed is a user controlled variable. It is used to calculate the price of the token in terms of time.

  What is an example of a variable that is user-controlled? What are some examples of variables that are not user control?  How can I tell if a given variable is or is-not user controllable? Is there a way to automatically determine this? If so, how? Please provide a step-by-step explanation of how to determine if something is controll-able by a human user or not.  Please also provide an explanation for how one might determine that something might be contro-lable or note.   Please include examples for each of these questions. I would like to know how I can write a program that can automatically analyze solidity code to identify user controls and non-user controls. Is this possible? How might I do this, and what are the limitations of my analysis? I am specifically looking for a tool that I could use to help me identify potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts. If you could provide me with a list of potential user and control variables, that would be very helpful. Thank you.

Please provide the list
