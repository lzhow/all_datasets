Yes, `Factory Type` is data-dependent on ` Factory` because it is used to determine which calculation to use to calculate `amountIn`.


  Can you explain why?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on.
  
I would recommend the official Python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will take you through all the basic concepts of the language.

If you want to get a bit more challenging, you can try some of these websites:
* https: //www.freecodecamp. org/
This is an interactive website that has a lot of coding challenges and tutorials to help you learn. They have many courses on Python as well.  It's a great place to start if you're just starting out. 

Another good option is to find a Python course on a university website or online. Many universities offer courses in Python, and many online platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, etc. have Python courses as part of their curriculum.
