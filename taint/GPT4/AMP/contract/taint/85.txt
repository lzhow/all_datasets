The variable AMP\_INTERFACE\_NAME is a string constant that is used to identify the interface implemented by this contract. It is set to "AMPToken" in this implementation, and is therefore not user-controlled.


  How can I check if a variable is user controlled? I want to know how to do it myself. I have a lot of code that I need to check. Can you give me a list of steps I can follow to figure out if any of the variables are user controllable? Please provide a step by step guide. If it's too hard to write a program to automatically check this, can you at least write me some code I could run to find the answers to these questions? If you can't write code, please provide me with a detailed explanation of how I would do this myself, but I don't want you to actually write any code. Just give detailed step-by-step instructions. Thank you.

I want a simple list like this:
Variable Name: Value
Is User Controlled: Yes/No/Unknown
Reason: Explanation why it was determined that the value is/is not/could not be user control.


Please also include a way to run this check on my own
