The variable 'EC\_5\_7\_INVALID\_RECEIVER' is a constant defined in Error Codes.sol, which is part of the OpenZeppelin library. It is used to indicate that the receiver address is invalid.

As such, the value of this variable is fixed and cannot be changed by users of a smart contract. Therefore, we can conclude that it cannot possibly be controlled directly by a user of our smart contracts.


  How can I find out if a variable or function in Solidty is constant? I want to write a tool that can automatically analyze Soliditiy code. I need a list of all the keywords that I can search for. Can you give me a short list?
Can you also give a description of each keyword? For example, what does "view" mean in "function myFunction() public view"?





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?  I know there are many, but I just need the basics.  Please explain in layman's terms.   I will provide a Rubik's cube to solve.    Thanks.     JPP is like a speed-cubing algorithm. First you permute the pieces, then
