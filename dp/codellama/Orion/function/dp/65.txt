  
The label is 'No'.

In the `sub` function, the first argument `a` is not dependent on any other variable in that function. It is only used as an input to the subtraction operation.
Similarly, in `function` div, `b`is not dependant on ` a` or anyother variable. ` b`  is used only as input for the division operation in this function .
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
