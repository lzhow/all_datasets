  
No, the `Equilibrium` variable in function `False` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is defined in a library.

The `ER2C` library defines the constant `EQULIBIRIM` as `100`. This constant is used to represent the equilibrium point in liquidity pooled assets. It is a fixed value and cannot be changed by any user input. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled internally by a third-party library and not by an external user, and the answer is "no".
