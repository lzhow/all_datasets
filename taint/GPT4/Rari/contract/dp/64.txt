Reason: The variable `cToken` in the function `setCompBorrowSpeedInternal` represents a CToken contract address that is being used to set the borrowing speed of a particular market within the RewardsDistributor contract. This variable is used to access and update the borrowing state and speed for that specific CToken market.

On the other hand, the variable `comp` in the function `grantCompInternal` represents the ERC-20 token (in this case, the rewards token) that is being transferred to users as a reward. This variable is used to interact with the token contract to transfer the specified amount of tokens to a user.

There is no direct data dependency between `cToken` and `comp` as they are used in different contexts and for different purposes within the contract. `cToken` is related to the state and operations of a specific market, while `comp` is related to the rewards token balance and transfer operations. They operate independently of each other within the contract's logic.
