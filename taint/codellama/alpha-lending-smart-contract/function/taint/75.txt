  
The variable `baseborrowrate` in function `getBaseborrate()` is a public variable, which means that it can be accessed and modified by anyone. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.

In Solidiy, public variables are variables that are declared outside of a function and can therefore be read and written to by any function or external contract. They are not private, meaning that they are accessible from outside the contract, and they can also be modified from the outside.
Public variables can have a significant impact on the security of the smart contract and should be used with caution. It is important to ensure that publicly accessible variables do not contain sensitive information or are properly secured.
