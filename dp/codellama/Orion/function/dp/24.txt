The `function swap` has a local variable called `pair` that is defined as `IOrinPoolv 3Pair (OrinoMultiPooLibrary .pairfor (cur Factory, Input, Output))`. The `address cur factory` variable is passed as an argument to the `_ swap function`.
However, `The amount Out variable` does not depend on`cur factory`. It is calculated using the`amounts` and `path` variables, which are also passed to`_swap` as arguments.
