  
No, the `_ blockTimestamplast` variable in function `getReserve` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and is only accessible within that function. It is initialized with the current block timestamp when the contract is deployed and it does not change after that. Therefore, any changes made to the value of `_BlockTimstamLast ` by a user will not affect the behavior of the smart contract.

The reason for this is that the `blockTimelast ` variable is a private variable, which means that it can only be accessed within the scope of its function, and cannot be modified by any external function or user interaction. Additionally, since the block timestamps are generated by Ethereum' s blockchain, they are not subject to user manipulation.
