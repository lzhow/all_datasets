  
No, the ` amount` variable in `buyerc 75` is not dependent on ` from` the in function` onerc 51` .

The ` buyerc` function is called with the parameters `erc23Tokenaddress`, ` erC 31ids`, and `erC5 6amount`. The ` oner`c`function is a pure function that returns the selector for the`onerc5 `received` event.
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
