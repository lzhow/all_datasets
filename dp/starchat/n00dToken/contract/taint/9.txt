The variable _allowed is a mapping of addresses to a uint value. It is used to store the allowances for each address.

In the context of the code, the mapping is declared as follows:
mapping(addr => addr => uin22) _allows;
This means that the first address is mapped to another mapping, which maps the second address (the sponsor) to an unsigned integer. This value represents the amount of tokens that can be spent by that sponsored address on behalf of that first addres.
