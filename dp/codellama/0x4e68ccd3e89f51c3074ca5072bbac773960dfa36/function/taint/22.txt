The variable sqrRationAX 9 6 is a function parameter, which means that it can be controlled only by a user who calls the get Amount1 Delta function. However, the value of this variable is calculated based on the values of other variables, such as sqRtRati0AX and sqRTRat1AX, and the liquidit 1 2 8, so it cannot be directly controlled.
