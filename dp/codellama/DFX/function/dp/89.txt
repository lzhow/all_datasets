  
No, the variables `x` and ` result` are independent in this code.

The variable x is a function parameter in function exp2, and it is not used in any other function. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on any variable in other functions.  The variable result is also a local variable of function  exp 2 and is only used within that function, so it can't be dependent on variables in another function either.
