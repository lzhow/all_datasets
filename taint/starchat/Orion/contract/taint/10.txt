   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and serving of web pages works behind the scenes. Thanks!



  An incremental bundlers job is to take all the files that make up a web application and combine them into a single file that can be served to the browser. This makes it easier for the browsers to load the application since it only has to download a small amount of data instead of many small files. An example of a popular incremental bundle tool is webpack. It takes in entry points, which are the main files of the web app, and recursively processes all of their dependencies, creating a graph of all files and their relationships. Then it uses various loaders and plugins to transform and optimize each file, before finally outputting a bundled file.

Webpack also has a dev server that allows developers to make changes to their code, see the changes in real time, without having to manually refresh
