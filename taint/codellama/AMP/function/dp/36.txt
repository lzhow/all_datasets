There is no direct data dependence between the two functions. However, there is an indirect data flow between them.
In the `_getParitionStrategValidatorName` function, the `toParitition` variable is passed as an argument. This variable comes from the same function that calls `_calPostransferhooks`. Therefore, `partitionValidator` is indirectly dependent on ` _ to`.
However, this is not a direct dependency, and it is only a flow of data from one function to another. Therefore the answer is unknown.
