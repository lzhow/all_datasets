   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
   
    An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web application by combining multiple files into a single file. This reduces the number of requests made to server and improves the overall performance. Some popular examples of incremental bundle tools are Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, Browserify and esbuild.

These tools work by analyzing the dependencies between the files in your project and generating a graph of how they all relate to each other. Then they use this graph to generate the final bundle file that contains all the code from your application. By doing this, the tool can optimize your code by bunding together the most frequently used code into one file, and only loading the rest of the application when it's actually needed. Additionally, tools like Webpack can automatically optimize and compress your assets, which can further improve performance and reduce the size of your bundle.

    Incremental bundlers are particularly useful for applications that are built using a modular architecture, where each module is responsible for a specific set of functionality. With
