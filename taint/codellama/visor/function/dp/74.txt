In the constructor function, the `ERC-2O` contract is initialized with the name and symbol parameters. These parameters are passed to the `_setupDecimal` function.
`_setupdecimal` is a private function that sets the decmials of the token. It takes the decimal parameter as an argument. Therefore, `decmial` and `symbo` are dependent on each other.
