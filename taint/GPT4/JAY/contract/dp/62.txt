The variable `amount` in the function `buyERC1155` is not data dependent on the variable `from` in the function `onERC1155Received`. 

Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `buyERC1155` is only used to accumulate the sum of `amounts[id]` in the for loop. It is not influenced or affected by the variable `from` in the function `onERC1155Received`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
