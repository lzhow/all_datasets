  
No, the variables `_inputix` and `_ouputix_` are independent of the `_lenght_`.

The reason is that the value of `_outpuix _` is determined by the input parameter `_targetI_`, which is not dependent on `_len_gth_ `. The value `_inpu_ix ` is also determined directly by `_origin_ ` and is independent from `_ length_ `_.
