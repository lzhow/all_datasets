  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `Math.max` function, the variables `a` and `b` are used to calculate the return value. Therefore, `max(a, b)` is data-dependent on `min(b, a)`.
Similarly, in `Arrays.findLowerBound`, the local variable mid is used in a conditional statement to determine the value of the returned variable. This means that the data flow of `low` is dependent on mid.
Therefore, we can conclude that ` mid` data depends on variable array in function  ` findLowerbound`.
