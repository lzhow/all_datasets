  
The variable `proxy` in function `getProxyImplentation` is a parameter of the `TransparantUpgradableproxy.Sol` type. It is passed as an argument to the contract when it calls the method. Therefore, the value of ` proxy` cannot be controlled directly by a user, and it can only be changed by calling the upgrade method of a proxy contract.

Therefore, we can label the answer as 'No'.
