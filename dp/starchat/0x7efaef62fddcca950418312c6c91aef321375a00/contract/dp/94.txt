The contract has 4 contract variables: `reserve`, `blocktimestamplast`, and `klast`. The contract also has a mapping of address-to-uint named `balanceOf`.

`reserve` is a  `uint` that represents the amount of token  in each contract.
`_reserveX` are `1-byte` `signed` integers that represent the `amount of X` token in contract `X`.  The `0`th index is `balance of  token at contract  address  X`. 

In the constructor, the `_mint` function is called with `MINIMU_ LIQUDITY` as the second parameter.  This sets the initial liqudity of the token to `minimum_liquity`.  

After the liqudity is set,  the  `_update`  function  is  called. This function updates the reserves and blocktimestamp. 
 The `_safetransfer` method is used to transfer tokens from the address of this contract to the recipient.
