The ` _ price ` variable represents the current price of the JPY/USDT pair, which is obtained from the Chainlink price feed. However, ` buynftfeeJJ ` is a constant value that is set in line 30 of code. It is used to calculate the fee for buying NFT tokens, and it is independent of `_ _ _` price. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a dependent variable.
