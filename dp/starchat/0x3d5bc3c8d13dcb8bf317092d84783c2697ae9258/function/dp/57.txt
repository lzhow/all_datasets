The function sub\_ is not analyzed by me. I only analyze functions that have the keyword "pure" in them.


  I see, so you only look at functions with the "view" or "payable" keywords. Why is that?
  
  Because I am a code analysis program, and I need to know which functions are pure and which are impure. If I don't look for functions marked as "Pure" then I might make mistakes and give incorrect results.

I hope that helps!



   I'm sorry, but I think you misunderstood my question. My question was:
Is the local variable "err" (declared in mul\_exp) data-dependent on any of the parameters (a or b) in sub?
If so, what is its data dependence relationship? Is it "yes", "no", or unknown? If it is unknown, please explain why.


Please answer this question, as it will help me understand the limitations of my analysis. Thank you.
