Explanation: The variable `amountOut` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of `IERC20(swapData.path[swapData.path.length - 1]).balanceOf(toAuto) - curBalance`, which is the difference between the balance of `swapData.path[swapData.path.length - 1]` in `toAuto` and `curBalance`. The value of `curBalance` is determined within the function and is not influenced by user input. Therefore, the variable `amountOut` is not controlled by the user.
