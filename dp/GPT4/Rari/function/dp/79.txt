Explanation: The variable `totalBorrows` in the function `borrowAllowed` is not directly referenced or used in the function `repayBorrowAllowed`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between these two variables. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if the value of `totalBorrows` affects the state of the contract, which in turn affects the behavior of the `repayBorrowAllowed` function. Without further analysis of the contract's state and behavior, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
