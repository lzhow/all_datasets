Label: yes

Reason: The variable `to` in the `withdraw` function is an argument provided by the caller of the function. Since any user can call the `withdraw` function and specify the `to` address, it is controlled by the user. The function does not impose any restrictions on what the `to` address can be, other than it must not be the zero address (as checked by `require(to != address(0), "to");`). Therefore, the `to` variable is indeed controlled by the user who invokes the function.
