Label: no

Reason: The variable `_reserve1` in the function `_mintFee` and the variable `to` in the function `skim` do not have a data dependency relationship. Data dependency implies that the value of one variable is influenced by the value of another. In this case, `_reserve1` is an input parameter to the `_mintFee` function and is used to calculate local variables within that function. On the other hand, `to` is an input parameter to the `skim` function and is used as a destination address for token transfers. There is no code in the provided snippet that suggests any transfer of data or dependency between `_reserve1` and `to`. They are used in separate functions for different purposes without any direct interaction or shared state that would couple their values.
