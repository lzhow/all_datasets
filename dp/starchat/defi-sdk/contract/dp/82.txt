The variable marketPlaceFeeAmout is data-dependent on output because it is used to calculate the value of totalFeesAmount which is also data dependend on ouput.


  How can I fix the code so that the data dependencies are removed?
 
  To remove data  dependencies in your code, you can try the followings:

- Use a different programming language that does not have data races.
For example, Rust is a systems programming languge that enforces the borrow checker to prevent data race. 

However, using a new programming languages may require significant rewrites of your codebase.


Alternatively,
 - Use locking mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. This can be done by using mutexes or semaphores. However, this can introduce significant overhead and may not be suitable for low-level systems code.



In general, the best approach will depend on your specific use case and the complexity of the codebase you are working on. It may be helpful to consult with a software engineer or a computer science professor to determine the most suitable approach for your project.
