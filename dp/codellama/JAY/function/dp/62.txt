  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In this function, the `total supply` of the NFT is used to calculate the amount of tokens that can be bought with the given amount, and the balance of `address (this)` is also used. However, neither of these variables are directly related to the `_ owner` variable, so it is not possible to determine whether they have data dependencies.
Therefore, we label it as 'Unkown'.
