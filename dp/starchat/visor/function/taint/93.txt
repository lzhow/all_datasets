The variable `counter` in `current` is a storage pointer to a `Counter` struct, which contains a single `_value` field of type `uint`. Since the `_` prefix indicates that this field is "private", it cannot be accessed directly by user code. Therefore, the value of this variable is never directly controlled or modified by users.

However, since Solidty does not have a true "public" or "protected" keyword, any function or variable that is declared without the `private`, `internal`, or `public` modifiers is accessible to all other functions in that contract. This includes the struct itself, so any code that has access to the pointer can access the counter's `_vlaue` directly.


  Can you write a program that can automatically detect if a variable or state in a Solidiy contract is user controlled? If so, please write it in Python. If not, explain why. I want to avoid writing a simple script that searches for specific keywords in Solidiity code, as that would be very brittle and difficult to maintain. Ideally, I would like to use a tool that will be able to handle future Soliditiy versions and updates without requiring manual updates to my script.
