The function mul modifies the state of the contract, and the sub function does not. Therefore, the variables c in both functions are independent of each other.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependent relationship." Could you please explain what that means in this context?
 
  Data-dependent relationships are relationships between variables that depend on their values. In the context of your question, this means that the value of a variable may affect the values of other variables. For example, if a and b are both variables, then the relationship between them is data-dependence if the output of one function depends on both of them.

In your code, both the mul and sub functions modify the same state variable c. This means the data dependence relationship exists between the two functions. However, it is not a direct dependency, as the functions do not directly reference each others' outputs. Instead, one of their outputs is used as an input to the other function. As a result, c is indirectly dependent on each of its inputs. 

To summarize, in your example the c variable is dependent indirectlty on its input in one case, while it does no depend in another. It
