  
No, the `_ name` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is set at the time of deployment. It is a part of the contract' s code, and it cannot be changed by any user interaction.

The constructor function in Solidiy is used to initialize the state of a contract when it  is deployed. In this case, `_ _ name ` is assigned the value "Alpha Token" and `_ symbol`is assigned " ALPHA". These values are set when the  contract is created and cannot  be modified by users. Therefore, they are not considered controlled variables.
