The codes above are **not** semanticlly equal, meaning that the first code will output a different result when run with the exact same inputs than the second code. This difference is due to the different behaviour of the recursive `quicksort` function: the code in the mutated version of `QuickSort` uses the prefix operator `--` in its while-loop conditional, which decrements the variable `lower` **before** checking its value, instead of incrementing it **after**. This change has the effect of shifting the position of every element smaller than `bound` to their correct positions, but it also shifts every negative index down, since `--lower = upper` becomes `upper = lower +1`, which makes `while ( lower < bound)` evaluate to true for every index where `data [lower] == bound`. As a result, the call to `swap(data, bound, i)` will not have any effect, because there are no elements smaller that `bounds` at positions lesser than or equal to it. The resulting sorting of arrays using this implementation of quick sort will be incorrect.
