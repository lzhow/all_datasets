  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `function trymul( uint 2 5 6 , uint  2  5  6 ) internal  pure  returns  ( bool ,  uint   2   5   6  )` function, the  variable  ` c` is defined as `a *b`. The variable a is passed as an argument to the try mul function. Therefore, `C` depends on `A` and `B`.
