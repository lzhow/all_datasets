  
No, the `AMTP_TKNS_RCPNT` variable is a constant string that is defined in line 22 of the code. It is set to the string "AMPT_TRCPNTS" and is used as a label for the interface that the contract implements. This interface is called `IAmp_Token_Recipiets` and it allows the recipients of tokens to receive notifications when tokens are transferred to them.

The variable itself is therefore not user-controlled, but the data that it represents (the address of a recipien) is user controlled. In other words, if a user wants to be notified when a token is transferred, they can implement the IAmpt_Toke_nRecipeints interface and set their address as the value of this variable. However, this is an optional feature and the default value is simply the empty string.
