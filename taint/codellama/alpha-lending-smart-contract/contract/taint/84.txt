  
No, the ` offset` variable in function `decodeBytes` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can only be modified by other functions in this contract.

The `shift` modifer is used to modify the value of `data` and ` data` can be only modified in other function in contract, so the offset variable is also not modified.
