In the function `_setPendingAdmin`, the contract state `pendingAdmin` is directly assigned the value of the variable `newPendingAdmin`. This creates a data dependency relationship between `pendingAdmin` and `newPendingAdmin`, as the state of `pendingAdmin` is now dependent on the value passed to `newPendingAdmin` when the function is called. Here is the relevant line of code:

```solidity
pendingAdmin = newPendingAdmin;
```

This line shows that the value of `newPendingAdmin` is used to update the state variable `pendingAdmin`, hence there is a data dependency.
