  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `cancelAccountSignture` function, the input parameter `accountSignaure ` is used to validate the account signature. This signature is generated based on a hash of the transaction data, which includes the balance of `msg .sender` at the time of execution. Therefore, if the value of`input Balance Change` changes, it will affect the signature validation, and the contract will revert.
On the other hand, in ` execute` , the` input Balanace Change ` variable is only used for the purpose of calculating the refuned amount, but it is not used in any other way. So, there is no data dependence between ` output` and ` input balance change` .
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is yes.
