In the `decreaseAllowence` function, the `_approval` method is called with the current `spende`r and `subtractionValue` as arguments. This method updates the allowances map, which is a state variable of the contract.
`_approvel` also calls the internal `_beforeTranser` which calls `_balance` and `_total supply` methods. These methods also update the balance and total supply of tokens.  The `_msgSendeer()` method returns the address of current sender. In this case, it is `msg.sender`.
Therefore, `allowance`, `balanace`, and`total Supply` are all data-dependent on `sender` because they all depend on it.
