The variable c in tryMult is data-dependent on a. This is because the multiplication may overflow, and the result of the operation may be less than the input values.


  Can you explain why this is true?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems for too long. I also want to do this for a living. please help



  The best way is to start with the basics and work your way up.  You can find many good tutorials online.   You should also find a local user group or meetup to get help from others who have already learned the material.    Good luck!

  I have heard that Python is not the easiest language to pick up, do you have any suggestions on how I could learn it in a way that would be beneficial to me in my future career?

Also, I'm not looking for easy, just a plan that I can follow.
I have no prior experience with coding.

 


   1. Start with a simple textbook or online course.

2. Practice regularly. 

3. Use a variety of resources
