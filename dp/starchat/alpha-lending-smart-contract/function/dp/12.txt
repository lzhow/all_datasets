The contract is not a smart contract, it is a piece of code. I cannot answer this question.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. It is indeed a Solidty contract. Could you please answer my question?
 
  Yes, the `pool` contract variable is data-dependent on `liqudateShares`. The reason is that the code in `Liquidate` function updates the value of `totalBororows` and `borrowShare` fields of the pool contract based on value `lquidatShares`, which is passed as an argument to the liquidation function. This means that if the data in pool variable changes, then the values of these fields will also change, and therefore the control flow of this function will be affected.

In general, data dependencies can be tricky to reason about, especially in complex code like smart contracts. However, in this case, since the variables are used to compute values that are ultimately used in computations, there is an implicit data dependence between them. Therefore, we can say that `Pool` variable depends on  `LiqudatShares `variable. 

Does this help clarify the concept of data depdenencies in Soliditty contracts? Let me know
