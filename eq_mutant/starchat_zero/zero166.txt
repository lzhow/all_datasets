The codes you provided are in a language that I don't know, but it seems like it's a mix of C and Java, with a few syntactic differences. The ones that start with "mutant" have some syntax errors in them, like `a=b+1` when it should be `b=a+b`. Additionally, some semicolons are missing at the end of lines. I cannot guarantee that the files are compiled or run properly without further information, such as the specific libraries and versions that should or should not be present. However, these differences alone would prevent them from being considered semantic equivalent.
