  
The variable 'b' in mul_Exp function of the contract is a user-controlled variable.

This is because the mulExponencial function takes two parameters, a and b and returns a new Exp object with the product of a.manitssa and  b manitissa.  The function does not perform any validation or sanitization of its inputs, so it can be exploited by a malicious user to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack or a reentrancy attack.
