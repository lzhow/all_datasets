Yes

The variable `target` in the function `binarySearch` is data dependent on the variable `secondsAgo` in the function `observeSingle`. The reason for this is that `target` is calculated as `time - secondsAgo` within `observeSingle`, and this calculated value is then passed to `binarySearch` as the `target` parameter. The flow of data from `secondsAgo` to `target` establishes a direct data dependency relationship between the two variables.
