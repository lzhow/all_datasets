Yes, `totalLiqudityBalance`, `collateraBalancebase`, and `borrowBalanceBace` are all data-dependent on `compoundLiquiditybalance`.


 
Can you explain why?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems and want to move on to more complex projects.
  
Python is an interpreted language, which means that code written in it is executed line-by-line by an interpreter. This makes it easy to experiment with code, as you can see the results of each line of code as soon as it's typed. Additionally, Python has a large and active community of developers, meaning that there are many resources available to help you learn.

To get started with Python, you should first install Python on your computer. If you're on a Mac or Linux machine, this should already be installed. On a Windows machine you will need to download and install it. Once you have Python installed, there is no additional setup required. All you need is access to the internet, and a text editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code, but any text edior will do.
