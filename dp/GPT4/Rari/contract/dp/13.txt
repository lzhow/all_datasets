yes, the variable `borrowSpeed` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is data dependent on the variable `borrowSpeeds` in the function `_setCompSpeeds`. 

Explanation: The function `_setCompSpeeds` sets the `borrowSpeeds` for multiple `cTokens`. Then, in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex`, the `borrowSpeed` for a specific `cToken` is retrieved using `compBorrowSpeeds[cToken]`, which is set in the `_setCompSpeeds` function. Therefore, there is a data dependency between the two variables.
