In the given code, the `_mints` and `_burns` functions are the only functions that modify the value of `_totalsupply`. These functions can only be called by external accounts, which means that the total supply of the token is only controlled indirectly by users.
Therefore, `_ totalsuply ` is indirect control by user, and the answer is no.
