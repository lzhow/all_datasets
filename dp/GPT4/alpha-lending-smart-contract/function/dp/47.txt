Label: no

Reason: The variable `compoundedBorrowBalance` in the function `getUserPoolData` is assigned a value from the function call `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance(_user, _token)`. There is no direct reference to the variable `_amount` from the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmount` within the `getUserPoolData` function or the `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance` function call. The variable `_amount` is a parameter of the `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmount` function and is used locally within that function to calculate a return value. There is no code provided that shows a connection or data flow between `_amount` and `compoundedBorrowBalance`, hence there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables based on the given code snippet.
