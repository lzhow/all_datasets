Reason: The contract state `_totalSupply` is data dependent on the variable `_amount` in the function `_approveByPartition` due to the following reasons:

1. The `_approveByPartition` function is used to set the allowance of a spender for a specific partition of tokens owned by a token holder. The `_amount` variable represents the new allowance value to be set.

2. The `_totalSupply` represents the total number of tokens in existence for the contract.

3. The `_mint` function, which is called within the contract, increases `_totalSupply` by a certain value when new tokens are created.

4. The `_mint` function is indirectly related to `_approveByPartition` because the allowance set by `_approveByPartition` could be used by a spender to transfer tokens, which could involve minting new tokens if the implementation allows for such behavior (e.g., in a scenario where tokens are minted upon transfer).

5. The `_amount` in `_approveByPartition` could potentially be used to mint new tokens if the spender is allowed to mint tokens, which would affect `_totalSupply`.

6. Although the direct relationship between `_totalSupply` and `_amount` is not evident in the `_approveByPartition` function itself, the allowance set by this function could lead to a change in `_totalSupply` through other functions that mint tokens based on the allowance.

Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_totalSupply` and `_amount` because changes to the allowance set by `_approveByPartition` could indirectly lead to changes in `_totalSupply` through the minting process.
