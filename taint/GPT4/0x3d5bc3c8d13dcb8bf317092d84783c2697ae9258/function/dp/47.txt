Reason: The variable `mathErr` in the function `accrueInterest` is a local variable that is used to store the result of mathematical operations within the `accrueInterest` function. It is assigned values based on the outcomes of these operations and is not influenced by any external variables outside of the `accrueInterest` function.

On the other hand, the variable `error` in the function `redeemInternal` is also a local variable that is assigned the result of the `accrueInterest` function call. The `error` variable is used to check if the `accrueInterest` function executed successfully and does not feed any value back into the `accrueInterest` function or affect the `mathErr` variable within it.

Since there is no flow of data from `error` to `mathErr` and they operate independently within their respective functions, there is no data dependency relationship between `mathErr` in `accrueInterest` and `error` in `redeemInternal`.
