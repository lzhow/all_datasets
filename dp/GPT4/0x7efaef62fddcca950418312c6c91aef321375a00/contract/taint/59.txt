Reason: The variable `_token1` in the function `skim` is assigned the value of the state variable `token1`, which is set during the initialization of the contract and represents one of the tokens in the pair managed by the contract. The initialization function `initialize` can only be called once by the factory contract, and not by an arbitrary user. Therefore, `_token1` is not controlled by the user but by the contract's initialization logic.
