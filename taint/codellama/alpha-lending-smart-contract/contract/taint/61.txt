  
The variable 'pool' in function 'burnAltoken' is 'Unknown'.

This is because the 'Pool' variable is defined in a different contract, 'LedingPool', and it's not clear if it can be controlled directly by a user or not.
It'd be helpful to analyze other parts of the code to determine if 'pools' can potentially be modified by users.
