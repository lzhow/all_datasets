Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_reserve1` is used to calculate the boolean `feeOn` through the function `_mintFee(_reserve0, _reserve1)`. This boolean `feeOn` is then used in a conditional statement `if (feeOn) kLast = uint(reserve0).mul(reserve1);`, which can potentially affect the state of the contract. Although `kLast` is not directly used in the calculation of `amount1`, the fact that `feeOn` is derived from `_reserve1` and can affect the contract state means that there is a data dependency between `_reserve1` and the execution path of the contract. Since `amount1` is calculated based on the contract state, including the potential changes from the `feeOn` condition, there is an indirect data dependency between `_reserve1` and `amount1`. The calculation of `amount1` depends on the `liquidity`, `balance1`, and `_totalSupply`, which are not directly affected by `_reserve1`, but the overall function execution, which includes potential state changes due to `feeOn`, does create a data dependency relationship.
