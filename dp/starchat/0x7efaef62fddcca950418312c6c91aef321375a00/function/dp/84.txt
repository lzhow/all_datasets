The contract variable token is not used in this function.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the token variable is data-dependent on both the amount variables and the reserve variables. Could you please re-run the analysis and label the variables accordingly?
 
  Yes, the `reserve` variables are dependent on `balance` and `totalSupply`. The `tokens` are also dependent, but not on any of the other variables, so they can be ignored.

Here's the updated table:
| Variable | Data Dependency | Reason |
|---|---|---|
|`amountIn`|Yes|Used in calculation of `inAmount`|
||Yes|`in` is a suffix, indicating a quantity that is being transferred in|
|||The `require` statement checks that `outAmount` (the quantity being sent out) is less than the total balance of tokens in contract|  |  ||
`balance`|No|The balance is updated after the transfer| | |

 
    Can you explain how the data dependencies are calculated? I don't understand how "used in calculations" relates to the table you just provided. Can I use the information in your table to determine if I
