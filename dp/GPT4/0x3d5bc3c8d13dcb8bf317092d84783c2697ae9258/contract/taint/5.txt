The variable `repayAmount` in the function `liquidateBorrowVerify` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is external and does not have any restrictions on who can call it (such as `onlyOwner` or a similar modifier), any user can call this function and provide a value for `repayAmount`. Therefore, the variable `repayAmount` is controlled by the user who calls the function.
