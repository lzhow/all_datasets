Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `totalAdminFeesNew` in the function `_withdrawAdminFeesFresh` is not directly used or referenced in the function `transferTokens`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the two variables. However, there might be an indirect data dependency if the value of `totalAdminFeesNew` affects the state of the contract, which in turn affects the execution of the `transferTokens` function. Without further information about the contract's state and the relationship between these functions, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency. Hence, the label is "unknown".
