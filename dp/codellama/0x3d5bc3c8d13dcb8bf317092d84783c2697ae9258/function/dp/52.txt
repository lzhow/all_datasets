  
No, the variables `totalBorrrows` and ` seizesTokes` are independent.

The reason is that the ` totalborrows ` variable is defined in a different function, `  total Borrows Current `, and the` seiseToks `variable is only defined within the scope of the  ` liquidationBrowFres ` function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
