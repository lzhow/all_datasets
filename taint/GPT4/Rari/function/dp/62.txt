Label: unknown

Explanation: Based on the given code snippet, it is not possible to determine whether the contract state `borrowRateMaxMantissa` is data dependent on the variable `blockDelta` in the function `finishInterestAccrual`. The code does not provide any direct assignment or usage of `borrowRateMaxMantissa` in relation to `blockDelta`. Therefore, the data dependency between these two variables is unknown.
