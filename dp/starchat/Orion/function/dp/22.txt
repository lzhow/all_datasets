The function is not complete, and I cannot tell if the variables are dependent or not. However, I can give you a general answer:

In general, if a variable is used in a calculation that is then stored in another variable, then the two are likely data-dependent.
However, it's important to note that this is a conservative estimate, as the code may actually have no data dependencies at all.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data dependence is when one variable depends on another. For example, in your code, the result variable in decimaltobaseunit depends both on assetaddress and amount variables. If the value of asset address changes, so will the values of result. This is because the calculation of the decimal value depends not only on amount but also on how many decimals the asset has. So, when the address of an asset changes the number of decimals also changes. Therefore, result will also change. 

This is an example of data dependance. In your case, you are using the same variable twice, once to calculate the decimals and once again to do the actual calculation.
