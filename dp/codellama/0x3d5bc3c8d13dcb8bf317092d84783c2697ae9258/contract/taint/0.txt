  
The variable 'redemptionTokes' in function 'reddemVerifty' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the ' redemptioToks' variable is passed as an argument to the reedem function, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user who calls the reddem function.

In general, any variable that is directly passed to a function as a parameter can potentially be influenced by an external user, and therefore should be considered as controlled. This is because the value of the parameter is determined by whoever calls that function and can therefore be manipulated by them.
