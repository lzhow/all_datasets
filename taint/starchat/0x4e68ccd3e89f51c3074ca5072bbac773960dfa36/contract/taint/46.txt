The variable tickLowers is a user input and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a tool I can use to help me identify user-controlled variables?

I'm writing a smart contract and I want to make sure that the variables I use in my contract are user inputs.  How can I do that? Is it possible to use static analysis tools to do this? If so, which tools can help with this task? Please let me know how I could do it.
If it's not possible or too complicated to write a static analyzer for this, is there any other way to find user control in Solidty? I'm not very experienced with Solidit, so I don't know all the features. Can you give me some tips on how to identify if something is controllable by a human user or not? Can I rely on the type of the thing to know for sure? For example, if it has a type like address or string, can you be sure it can't be controlled, or is it still possible that it could be? What about if I have a mapping where the key is something like an address, and the value is an int, for example?
