  
The variable _`optimaUtilizatioRate ` in function contructor is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the constructor function is called by a user, and the value of `_` optimal Utilization Rate` is passed as an argument to the contruct function. Therefore, the contract can be controlled or modified by users.

In addition, this variable is also used in other functions such as `calculateInteresRate`, `getOptimaLUtilizaionRate`. Therefore it can also be modified or controlled through these functions.
