Reason: The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is determined by the result of the `token.call` operation, which is a low-level call to transfer tokens. It is dependent on the parameters `token`, `to`, and `value` that are passed to it. The variable `amount1Out` in the function `swap` is used to determine how much of token1 should be transferred out and to check against the reserves, but it does not directly influence the `token.call` operation within `_safeTransfer`. The `success` variable would capture the success status of the token transfer, which is a separate action from the logic that uses `amount1Out` in `swap`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between `success` and `amount1Out`.
