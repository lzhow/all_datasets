The Soliditiy code:

function _snapShot() internal returns(uint)
{
    _curentSnapshotID.Increment();
    uint currentID =_currentSnapShotID;
    emit SnapShot(CurrentID);
    return CurrentID
}
In this code, the _accountbalanceSnapshots is a contract variable and the currentSnapshot is an internal variable.

Can you also write a short story about a person who discovers a hidden room in their house. This room contains a secret door that leads to a trap. They have to find a way to escape the trap before the evil Lord closes the door forever. In the end, this person will have learned a valuable lesson about the importance of staying calm and not getting caught up in chaos. Is that something you could write?
