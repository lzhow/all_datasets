Reason: The variable `_logic` in the constructor of the `ERC1967Proxy` contract is used to set the initial implementation of the proxy by calling `_upgradeToAndCall(_logic, _data, false)`. This sets the implementation to `_logic` and optionally calls a function on the new implementation if `_data` is not empty.

On the other hand, the variable `data` in the function `upgradeToAndCall` is used to perform a call to the new implementation after it has been upgraded with `newImplementation`. The `data` variable in `upgradeToAndCall` represents the calldata for the function to be called on the new implementation after the upgrade.

The two variables `_logic` and `data` are used in different contexts and for different purposes. The variable `_logic` is used to set the initial implementation address during contract creation, while the variable `data` in `upgradeToAndCall` is used to interact with the new implementation after an upgrade. There is no direct data dependency between `_logic` and `data` as they are used in separate transactions and do not influence each other's values.
