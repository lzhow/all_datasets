The variable in this function is "controlled by" the caller, as they are the only ones who can set the value of the mapping.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract that are controlled?  Also, can you explain how the contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks?

I'm trying to write a test for the re-entracy attack, but I can't seem to find the right variable to manipulate.  Can I just set it to a high value, or does it have to be a specific value?   I'm using the remix solidity IDE.
Can you also explain to me how to use the debug() function? I've tried to follow the instructions, and I keep getting an error that I don't understand.   Can we do a zoom meeting to go over this? 

Thank you!
