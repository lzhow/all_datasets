  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `Receiver` struct, the field `rule` is of type `IalphaRelease Rule`, which is a reference to an instance of the contract `Alpha Release Rule`. The `alpha ReleaseRule ` contract has a function called `get ReleaseAmount` that takes two parameters, `_from Block` and `_to Block`, and returns a `uint 2 5 6` value.
When the`set AlphareleaseRule function`is called, it creates a new instance `of ReceiveRule`, passing in `_ receiver` as the first parameter and ` _ rule`as the second parameter. This means that the value of ` receiver Rule. rule ` is dependent on `_ rule`, since it is set to the address of `_rule`.
Therefore, ` ReceiversRule `.rule is data-dependent on` _ receiver `, since the latter is used to set the former.
