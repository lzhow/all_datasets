The variable CLOSET_FATOR is a constant in this contract and is defined as follows:
`uint public constant CAPITAL_REQUIREMENT_MULTIPLIER = 1.05;`
This means that it cannot be changed by any user input and its value is fixed. Therefore, the value of CALT_CAP_RQMT_MLTPLER is determined at compile time and cannot vary at runtime.
