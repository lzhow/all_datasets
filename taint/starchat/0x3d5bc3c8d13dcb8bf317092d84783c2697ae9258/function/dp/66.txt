The variable err in mulExponent3 is not a state variable, so it is neither data-dependent nor data independent.

However, the scalar variable in ` mulscalarTruncate` is a function argument, and it can be influenced by the state variables in that function. Specifically, it could be modified by a call to `safeAdd` or `sub`, which could change the value of ` err`.
So, in this case, we can say that the data dependence relationship between ` scalar` and `  err`in `   mulscalartuncate`is unknown.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependences relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  Data dependenices relationship is when one variable depends on another variable. In the example you gave, `variable err depends variable scalar`.
