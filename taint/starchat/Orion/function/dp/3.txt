Yes, `i` is a loop variable and is incremented in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the value of `amount[j]` at the end of each loop iteration depends on its previous value.


 
Can you explain why this is true?






   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples? Can you name a few popular ones? I'm specifically looking for tools that can bundle together only the changes made to a web application since the last time it was bundled. I know there are tools like Webpack and Rollup that are capable of this, but I want to know about them from a user's perspective, so I can decide if they're suitable for my use case. Thanks!




An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle web assets into a single file that is served to the user. This reduces the number of requests made by the browser to load the web page, which improves the performance of your application.

The incremental part of incremental bundle means that only changed files are re-bundled. For example, if you make a change to your JavaScript code, only that file will be recompiled and included
