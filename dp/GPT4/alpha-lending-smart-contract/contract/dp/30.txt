Label: no

Reason: The variable `data` in the function `decodeU16` and the variable `data` in the function `decodeU256` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. Each function has its own separate context, and the `data` parameter in one function is not related to the `data` parameter in another function. When the functions are called, they will receive their own arguments, and changes to the `data` parameter within one function will not affect the `data` parameter in the other function. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between the `data` variable in `decodeU16` and the `data` variable in `decodeU256`.
