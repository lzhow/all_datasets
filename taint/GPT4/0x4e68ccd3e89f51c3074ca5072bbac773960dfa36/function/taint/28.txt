Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `tick` in the function `getSurroundingObservations` is an input parameter to the function. In Solidity, input parameters to functions can be supplied by the user when they call the function. Since `getSurroundingObservations` is a private view function, it cannot be called directly from outside the contract. However, it can be called by other functions within the contract that are exposed to the user, and these functions may pass user-supplied data as arguments. Therefore, without additional context on how `getSurroundingObservations` is used within the contract, we must assume that the `tick` parameter could be influenced by the user, hence the label "yes".
