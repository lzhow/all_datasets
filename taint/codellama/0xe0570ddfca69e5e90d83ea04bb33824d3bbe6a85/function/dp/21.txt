  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `uint265 _ pool` variable is assigned the value of the balance of `want` tokens in `strategy`. The `earn()` function is called, which is not shown in this code snippet. After that, `_after` is calculated as the difference between the current balance and the previous balance. Then, `total_supply()` is checked, and if it is zero, then `share`s is set to `_amount`. Otherwise ` shares`is set as `_ amount` multiplied by ` total_ supply` divided by `_ pool`.
  The second function has the same logic as in function 1.
   In both functions,`_pool ` is used to calculate the amount of shares to be minted. Therefore, it can be said that the` shares ` variable in both function depends on` _ _Pool` .
