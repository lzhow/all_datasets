The variable 'fuseadmin' is a contract address that is set by a user and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? Is there a tool that can help me with that? I am not very experienced with solidity. Can you give me some tips on how to find out if something is controllable by an user in solidity?

I also have a function that takes a struct as an input. How can I check if each field in that struct is under the control of the caller? Can I use something like require() for that or do i have to write my own function? How would I do that if I don't know the type of each variable in advance? 

Can you also give some examples of how I could use require()?
