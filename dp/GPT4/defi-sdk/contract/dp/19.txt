Label: yes

Reason: The variable `reserveIn` in the function `getAmountOut` is data dependent on the variable `reserveOut` in the function `getReserves` because `getAmountOut` calls `getReserves` to obtain the reserve values, which are then used to calculate the output amount. The line `(uint256 reserveIn, uint256 reserveOut) = getReserves(pair, direction);` within `getAmountOut` shows this direct dependency, as both `reserveIn` and `reserveOut` are assigned values returned from `getReserves`. The calculation of `amountOut` in `getAmountOut` is based on the values of `reserveIn` and `reserveOut`, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
