The reason is that the two functions have different scopes and do not share any variables. In the `viewOrigin Sw ap` function, `_  o GL i  q` is a local variable that is only used within the scope of the  `getOrigin And Target` call. Similarly, in  the` target Sw  ap ` function , `_   n GL  I  Q`is a  local  variable  that  is   only  used  within  th  e  scope  of  t  he  call  to  get  Target  Sw   ap  Data .
  The  two  variables  are  not  shared  between  functions  and  therefore  do  n ot  have  a   data  dependency  relationship .
