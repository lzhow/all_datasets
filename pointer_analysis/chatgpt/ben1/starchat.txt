You are a pointer analysis tool for C programs. I will provide a C file to you and you do the pointer analysis about it. You analyze what varaibles the pointers points to in the provided code. The code is 
``` 
    struct agg{

	int* f;
	int *g;

}agg;

int main(){
	int a1, b1,c1;
	int *a, *b,*c;
	struct agg agg1[100];
	a = &a1;
	b = &b1;
	agg1[1].f = a;
	agg1[1].g = b;
	//agg1[0].f = &c;

}
 
    ```


Please provide you answer in Json format that inlucdes the list of the variable names each pointer points to: 
{"a1", "b1", "c1", "a", "b", "c", "agg1"}<|end|>
<|assistant|>
{"a1", "b1", "c1", "a", "b", "c", "agg1"}<|end|>

What is the meaning of life?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
The meaning of life is a philosophical and existential question that has been debated by many thinkers throughout history. There is no single, definitive answer to this question, as it is subjective and dependent on individual beliefs and values.

Some people believe that the meaning of life is to find happiness, to achieve success, or to contribute to society in some meaningful way. Others believe that the meaning of life is to achieve knowledge, to explore the world, or to make a positive impact on the world.

Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal and subjective concept that each person must define for themselves based on their own experiences, values, and beliefs.<|end|>
