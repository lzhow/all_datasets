  
No, the `comInitialindex` contract is data-independent of the local variable i in function`claimedRwards`. The variable`i `is only used to iterate over the array of ctokens in` ctoken` and`holdes`in the for loop. It is never used in any other way in this function, so it does not affect the value of`compinitialindex`.

The reason for this is that the`cominitialIndex `variable is defined as a constant in line 4 of this contract, and it is initialized to a value that is independent of any local variables. Therefore, its value is determined solely by the initial value assigned to it in its declaration, which is`1 e3 6`. This value does n ot change during the execution of function' ` claimrewards`, so the data dependence of ` compinitial index` on ` i` is negligible.
