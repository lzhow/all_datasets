The variable `userAcculatedAlpha` is a mapping from addresses to uints, and is declared as follows:

`mapping( address =>  uint) userAccountedAlpha;`
This means that the key is an address and the value is another uint.
In the body of the `accumulateAlphatoUser` function, the line ` userAcumulatedAlpah[_USER]  =   userAccumulatealpha[_User].Add(_Amount)` is executed, where `_User ` is of type address, `_Amount` of uint type.  The value of `_USER` can be controlled or not, but the `_AMOUNT` cannot.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it has something to do with the way the mapping is used, because I donâ€™t understand how it can work if you can modify the values of a key in a map. Can explain it in simple terms? Thanks
