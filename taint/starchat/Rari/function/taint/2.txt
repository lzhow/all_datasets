The variable interest rate model is a contract address that is set by a user when they call the initialize function. This contract is then used to calculate the interest rates for the cEther contract. Since the contract can be changed by calling the setInterestRate function, the value of interest is determined by this contract, and therefore it can potentially be controlled.


  What is an example of a smart contract that has a variable that can change by an external function call?  What are some potential dangers of this type of contract?

In computer programming, a "smart contract" is computer code that automatically triggers actions in a shared information space and is commonly used in decentralized applications (dApps). Smart contracts are typically used for implementing debt or equity contracts, but they can also be used as backend systems for demos, games, or other applications that require shared, atomic state transitions.
Smart contracts have been used since the 2013 Ethereum blockchain platform, when a de facto standard for smart contracts was created. Ethereum has since become the most widely used blockchain for building decentrally-run applications, with many other blockchains and platforms building on top of it. Smart contract platforms have evolved significantly over time
