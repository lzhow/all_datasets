The `MasterPrice` contract has a state called `admin` and a `bool` variable called`can AdminOverWrite`. The `add` function allows the `Admin` to overwrite the existing assignment of `Price Oracle`s to `Underlyng` tokens. This means that the value of` can Admin Overwrite `is not dependent on` underlying`.
