Yes, the variable `new_path` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is data dependent on the variable `tokenIndex` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of `tokenIndex` is used as the starting index for the loop in the `for` statement that constructs the `new_path` array. The loop iterates from `tokenIndex` to the length of `swapData.path`, and at each iteration, the value of `swapData.path[i]` is assigned to `new_path[j]`. Therefore, the value of `tokenIndex` directly affects the elements that are assigned to `new_path`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
