The contract state `receipts` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `createReceipt`. In the `createReceipt` function, the variable `amount` is assigned the value of `userAccumulatedAlpha[msg.sender]`, which represents the accumulated Alpha tokens for the user calling the function. This `amount` is then used to create a new `Receipt` struct that is pushed onto the `receipts` array. The `Receipt` struct includes the `amount` as one of its properties, directly linking the value of the `amount` variable to the state of the `receipts` array. Therefore, any changes to the `amount` variable will affect the contents of the `receipts` array, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
