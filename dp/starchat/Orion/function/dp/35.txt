   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems for too long. I also don't want to use a bloated IDE with a lot of unnecessary features. A good code editor with syntax highlighting and a simple debugger would be ideal. Something that is also easy to pick up and use, so that I can start coding and procrastinating won't stop me. Could you recommend a few such tools? And could you maybe recommend some simple games or programs that have simple coding requirements so I could get a feel for it? Thank you very much!
