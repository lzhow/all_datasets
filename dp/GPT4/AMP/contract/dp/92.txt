Label: yes

Reason: In the Solidity contract code provided, within the `_mint` function, the variable `_operator` is used alongside the variable `_to` in the call to `_callPostTransferHooks` and in the `emit` statements for the `Minted`, `Transfer`, and `TransferByPartition` events. The `_operator` variable represents the entity performing the mint operation, and `_to` is the address that will receive the minted tokens. The relationship between `_operator` and `_to` is established by the fact that the `_operator` is the one who initiates the minting process for the benefit of `_to`. The data dependency here is due to the logical relationship in the contract's operation where the `_operator` is acting on behalf of `_to` to increase `_to`'s balance by `_value`. The use of both variables in the same function call and event emissions indicates that there is a data dependency relationship between them within the context of the `_mint` function.
