Label: no

Reason: The variable `_account` in the function `mint` is not directly controlled by the user because the function `mint` is modified by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that only the owner of the contract can call the `mint` function and pass the `_account` parameter. Since the owner is typically a specific address set during contract deployment or transferred to another address through a controlled process, it is not a variable that any user can control at will. Only the owner has the privilege to determine the value of `_account` when invoking the `mint` function.
