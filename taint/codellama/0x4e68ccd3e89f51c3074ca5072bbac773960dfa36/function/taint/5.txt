  
No, the ` ticklower` variable in function `getFfeGrothinside` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` getfeegrowthiside` function takes in `ticlower`, ` ticupper`, and `feegrwothglobal0x108` as parameters. These parameters are not user-controlled, so the value of `tiicLower ` is also not under user control.
