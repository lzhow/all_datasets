Explanation: The variable `erc1155TokenAddress` in the function `buyNFTs` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155`. This is because the `buyNFTs` function calls the `buyERC1155` function, passing `erc1155TokenAddress`, `erc1155Ids`, and `erc1155Amounts` as arguments. The `buyERC1155` function then calls the `buyJayWithERC1155` function, passing `erc1155TokenAddress` and `erc1155Amounts` as arguments. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between these two variables.
