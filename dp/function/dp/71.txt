  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_setpendingimplementation` function, the `pengingComtrollerimplementation ` variable is assigned a new value, which is ` newpEngingImplemenation`. This assignment creates a dependency between the two functions.
When the` _accepImplementaion`function is called, it checks the value of the pending implementation variable, ` pendingcomptrollImplmentation`, which was set by the previous function. If the current function is not authorized to make this change, an error is returned. Therefore, in this case, there is a clear data dependence between ` _ setPenginImpelementation` and `_acceImpplementaition`.
