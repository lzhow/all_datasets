In the `balaceOfUndelrying` function, the expression `mulScalerTrunctate` is used to calculate the balance of the account. This expression takes two arguments: `exp` and `accountTokes[ownder]`. The `Exp` type is defined in a separate library, and it is not clear how it relates to the other variables in this function. However, it appears that the value of `exchageRate`, which is a variable in `ExchangRateStoreInternal`, is passed as an argument to `MulScalrTruncatte`. This means that `BalanceOfUnnderlying` depends on ` exchangeRatestoredinternal`.
