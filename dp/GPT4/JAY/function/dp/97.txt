Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `total` in the function `buyNFTs` is not directly dependent on the variable `data` in the function `onERC1155Received`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `data` in the calculation of `total`. However, it is possible that the `onERC1155Received` function could indirectly affect the value of `total` through some other code execution path that is not visible in the provided code snippet. Without further information about the implementation of `onERC1155Received` and its potential impact on `total`, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship between these variables. Hence, the label is unknown.
