  
No, the `compInitialScaleExp` variable in this function is NOT controlled  by user input. It is a constant value that is set in line 4 of the code.

The `setExpScale()` function sets the value of `exponentScale`, which is used to calculate the interest rate for the ctoken. This function should only be called by an admin or a trusted party, as it can be used maliciously to manipulate the supply and borrow rates of a coken, potentially causing financial losses for users. Therefore, `comInitialExpale` is considered to be controlled internally by a system administrator or trust party.
