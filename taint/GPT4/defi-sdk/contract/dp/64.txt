Yes

The variable `pairs` in the function `getAmountsOut` is data dependent on the variable `length` in the same function. The reason for this is that `length` is used to determine the size of the `amountsOut` array and to control the loop that iterates over the `pairs` array. The loop uses `length` to determine how many times it should iterate, and during each iteration, it accesses an element of the `pairs` array based on the loop index `i`. Therefore, the processing of the `pairs` array elements is directly dependent on the value of `length`.
