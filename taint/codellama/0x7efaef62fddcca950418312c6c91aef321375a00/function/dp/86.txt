  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `safeTranfer` function is calling the `_transfer()` function of the token contract. This function takes three arguments: `to`, `from`, and `amount`. The `token` variable is passed as the first argument, which is a reference to the current contract's address.
Since the value of `val` is being passed to `transer()` as an argument and the balance of this contract is also being checked in `require()` statement, it can be inferred that the state of balanceOf is dependent on `valu`e. Therefore, we can conclude that `Balanceof` and`value `are data-dependent.
