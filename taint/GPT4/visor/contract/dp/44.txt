Label: no

Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` and the variable `target` in the function `functionCallWithValue` are function parameters of two separate functions. There is no direct relationship or dependency between them within the scope of the provided code. Each function operates independently, and the parameters are passed in by the caller of the function. There is no code within these functions that creates a data dependency between `account` and `target`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
