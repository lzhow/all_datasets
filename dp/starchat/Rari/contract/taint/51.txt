  Can you explain how you came to this conclusion?  What mathematical or logical techniques did you apply?

I'm trying to better understand how your tool works and what it's limitations are.  I'm particularly interested in how it determines whether a variable is user-controlled or not.
Can you provide some insight into how this is done? I'd love to know how the tool determines that a particular variable or function parameter is "controlled" or "uncontrolled".





   How do I make a table in MathJax? The following is an example of the table that I want to create:
$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
x & f(x) \\
 \hline
-2 & 4 \\
  -1 &  2 \\
    0 &   0 \\
     1  &    2\\
     2  &= 8
	\end{ array}  $$   You can create a
