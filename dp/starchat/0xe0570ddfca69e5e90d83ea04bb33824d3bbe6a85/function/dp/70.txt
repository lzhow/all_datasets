The contract variable `_shares` is not used in this function, so it is safe to assume that it does not affect the value of `balance()` or `totalSuppy()`.

However, the `want()` contract call could potentially modify the state of the smart contract, and thus affect its behavior. Therefore, it could be considered a "data dependency".
In this case, we cannot be certain that the `_SHARES` variable is data-dependent on `R`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "The `WANT()` Contract Call Could Potentially Modify the State of The SmartContract". Could you please explain further?
 
  In the code you provided, there is a call to the "want()" contract. This is an external contract that is potentially able to modify state in some way. If the call is made in a way that could modify its state, then it may be possible for the data flow analysis to be incorrect.
