Label: no

Reason: The variable `tickSpacing` in the function `tickSpacingToMaxLiquidityPerTick` is an input parameter to the function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. However, the context of this function is "internal" which means it can only be called from within the contract itself or from derived contracts, not directly by an external user. Since external users cannot call this function directly, they do not have control over the `tickSpacing` variable within this function. The value of `tickSpacing` is likely determined by the contract's logic or by other functions within the contract that are not directly influenced by user input.
