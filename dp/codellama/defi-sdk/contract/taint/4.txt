  
The variable 'wet' in function 'constructor' is labeled as 'Yes' because it takes an argument from the constructor. Therefore, the value of 'Wet is set by a user and is therefore controlled.

In the code, 'address' ' wet ' is defined as a parameter in constructor 'UniswanCall' as shown below:
constructor( address ' wet ' ) Wet( ' 'et ') {
}
This means that the ' WET ' variable is initialized with the address of the Wrapped Ether (Wrappped Ethereum) contract. This address is passed as an input to the contract constructor, which means the caller can control the initialization of this variable. As a result, this is considered a controlled variable and labled as "Yes".
