  
No, the `_ lendPool ` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a private variable and it can only be accessed by owner of the contract.

The constructor function sets the value of `_ _ l _ _` to `_ __ l __ _`, which is a reference to an instance of `IL _ __ __` that is passed as an argument to `Alpha __ Stake __ Pool`. The ` _ ` function can be called by anyone, but it does not modify the state of this contract, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user who is interacting with the smart contract through a front-end interface.
