  
No, the variables ` am t _` and `_ outputI x` are independent.

The variable am_t is defined in function  get Target Sw ap Data and is used to calculate the amount of the output asset. It is not dependent on any other variable in this function.  On the other hand, variable _ output I x is a parameter of function View Target swap Data, which is passed as an argument to the get target swap data function, and it is also used in that function to determine the balance of output assets. However, it does not affect the calculation of am _ t. Therefore, am  t is independent of _  output i x.
