Yes

The variable `success` in the function `getProxyAdmin` is data dependent on the variable `proxy` because `success` is the result of a `staticcall` to the address contained in `proxy`. The `staticcall` is used to execute the `getProxyAdmin` function of the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract, and the outcome of this call (success or failure) is stored in the `success` variable. If the address in `proxy` changes, it could lead to a different contract being called or a different response, which would affect the value of `success`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `success` and `proxy`.
