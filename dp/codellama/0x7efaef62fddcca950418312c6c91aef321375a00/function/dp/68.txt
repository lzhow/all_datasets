The variable 'success' in function '_safeTranfer' is not dependent on variable balanceAdjuted in 'swap' function.  The reason is that the 'balanaceAdusted' variable is only used in a require statement in swap function, which is a condition that is checked before the execution of the code. Therefore, the value of ' balance Adjust' will not affect the result of '_safetransfer'.
