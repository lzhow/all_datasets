The variable returnData is a memory variable that is used to store the return value of the low level call. It is declared as a bytes type and is allocated on the stack. Since it does not have a storage modifier, Solidty doesnot consider it to be a user controlled variable.


  How can I make it so that it considers it a controlled user variable? I want it labeled as such
 
  You can make the compiler consider a variable as user-controlled by declaring it as public or external. For example, you can change the declaration of return data to public and the code will compile successfully.

pragma solidity ^074.0
contract ControlledUserVariable {
    bytes public return_data1;
    function call_function() public {
        return1 = "Hello World";
    }
}
