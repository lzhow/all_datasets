yes, the `_erc1155_registry` variable is a global variable that is used to store the address of the ERC1750 registry contract. This contract is responsible for storing and managing the interfaces that have been implemented by other contracts. Since it's a globally accessible variable, any contract can modify its value and potentially interfere with the operation of other parts of a dAPP.


  How can I fix the code? I am a beginner and I don't know how to do it





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

In combinatorial mathematics, a J-P-Perm P LL algorithm is any algorithm that solves the JP‑Perm problem in time polynomial in J, P, and the length of L. J = |V| is number of vertices, V, in a graph, p is size of smallest set of generators for the graph and L is length (number of edges) of an optimal solution.
The JPermPLL algorithm was first described by Karp, Magnanti, Rinaldi, Szekeres, & Williams in 2102. It is based on
