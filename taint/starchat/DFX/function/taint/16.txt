yes, the symbol_ variable is user controlled.

The user can set the value of the _ symbol variable to any string they want, which could lead to unintended consequences if not properly handled.

  What are some examples of undesirable consequence that could result from not handling the ` symbol_` variable properly? Please provide an explanation for each example you provide.  Also, please provide some counter examples where the same type of issue does not occur. 

Thank you. I appreciate your help. This is very important to me.
