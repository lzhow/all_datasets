Explanation: The variable `tokenAOrWETH` in the function `addLiquidityFromExchange` is not controlled by the user. Its value is determined by the condition `if (tokenAOrWETH == address(0))`, which checks if `tokenA` is equal to the zero address. The value of `tokenA` is passed as an argument to the function, and it is not controlled by the user. Therefore, the variable `tokenAOrWETH` is not controlled by the user.
