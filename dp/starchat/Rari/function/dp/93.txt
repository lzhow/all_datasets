The variable "numBorrwoCaps" in function "_setMarkeBorrowcaps" is not used in "BorrowAllowed" function. Hence, it is safe to say that the variables are independent.


  Can you explain why you think the two are dependent?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to be able to use this knowledge to help my family and maybe even find a job as a software developer.  Please respond with some good first steps and some tips on how I can become proficient at python in a reasonable amount of time. Thank you.

I have heard that Python is easy to pick up if you know some other programming language like Java or C++. Is that true? If so, which language should I learn first? Please explain your reasoning. 

Also, are there any good books or courses that I could use to become more proficiencient at Python? 
 Thankyou. This is all new to me so any help is greatly appreciated.
 
Please note that my current level of proficiency is limited to simple tasks
