The variable accountBorrowNew is a memory variable that is used to calculate the new value of the borrow balance of a user, and is therefore not directly controlled or affected by any user input. It is updated based on the amount of collateral that the protocol has issued to the market, which is determined by supply and demand in each market. Therefore, the value stored in accountBrowsenew is calculated based solely on market conditions and does not depend on any input from the users.

In summary, while the account borrowNew variable is an important component of calculating the interest accrued by a borrowing user in a market and determining the maximum amount that can be borrowed from a given market at any given time, its value is ultimately determined based only on factors that are outside of our control, such as the supply/demand in different markets. As such, we can safely assume that it does NOT directly control or affect any of user's actions or decisions.


  Can you write a program that will automatically label all variables in Solidty code as either "user controlled" or "not user controlled"?
