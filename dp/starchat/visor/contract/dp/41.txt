Yes, `isContrac`t is data-dependent on `account`. The reason is that the `extcodeSize` instruction in EVM checks the size of the code at the given account address, which is a state variable.


  What is an example of a situation where this data dependence is not desirable?
 
  An example where data dependencies are undesirable is when the data is stored in a contract that is owned by a third party. In this case, the owner of that contract can change the state of said contract, potentially making the contract dependent on data that no longer exists. This can lead to unintended consequences and security vulnerabilities.

In general, it is important to ensure that any data used in smart contracts is secure and cannot be altered by any party other than the one who owns it. Additionally, contracts should be designed to be as decentralized as possible, with minimal reliance on centralized entities. By following these best practices, developers can create contracts that are more secure, reliable, and resilient to attacks.
