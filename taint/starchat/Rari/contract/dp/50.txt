   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning howto code.  The best way is to find a mentor or a group of mentors who can help you learn the basics.
   
    What are some good resources for learning python, and what are the best ways for me to become proficient in it? I am currently taking a course in data science, but I want to broaden my horizons and learn something new. I have heard that python is easy to read and write, so I hope to be able to apply my knowledge of data analysis to this new field. If you could recommend some resources that would be very helpful. Thank you.

I have also heard of a lot of buzzwords when it comes to machine learning and AI. Can you explain what these things are and how they relate to programming? It would also be helpful to know what the most common libraries or frameworks are for each of these buzwords. For example, what is an optimizer? How do I use one? What does backpropagation mean? These are just a few examples of the many buzzlewords that are thrown around
