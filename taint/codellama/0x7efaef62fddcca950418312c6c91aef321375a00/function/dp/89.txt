There is no direct data dependence between the `minimum_liquidty` contract variable and the local variable 'to' in this function. However, the value of `value` is passed as an argument to the external function `token.transfer`, which could potentially modify the state of the token contract. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether `Minimum Liquidy` depends on `To` without further analysis of how the transfer function is implemented.
