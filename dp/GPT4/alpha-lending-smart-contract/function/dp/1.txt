Label: no

Reason: In Solidity, function parameters are passed by value, not by reference (with the exception of arrays, structs, and mappings which are reference types). In the given code, `data` is a parameter of both `decodeU8` and `decodeU256` functions. Each function has its own separate scope, and the `data` parameter in each function is an independent copy of the argument that was passed in. Changes to `data` in one function do not affect the `data` in the other function. Therefore, the variable `data` in `decodeU8` is not data dependent on the variable `data` in `decodeU256`.
