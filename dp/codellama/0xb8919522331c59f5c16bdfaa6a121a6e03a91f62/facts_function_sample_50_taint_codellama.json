The reason is that the error Message is a string that is passed as an argument to the staticcall function. It is unclear whether the string is user-controlled or not.\n\nIn general, when analyzing the control of a variable in a smart contract, we need to consider the context in which the code runs and the inputs that are provided to it. In this case, the `functionStaticcall` function takes a `string` argument called `errormessage` that it uses to construct an error string if something goes wrong. However, since we don't know what the value of this argument is, whether it's user controlled or generated by a different part of code, or even if it can be controlled at all, then we cannot say for sure whether this variable is under user control or no."

Therefore, the value of ` proxy` cannot be controlled directly by a user, and it can only be changed by calling the upgrade method of a proxy contract.\n\nTherefore, we can label the answer as 'No'.\n"
