In the first function, the `_burn` function is called with the argument `_sharess`, which is a function call. This function modifies the state of the contract, specifically the `balances` mapping.
Then, in line 10, `want().withdrawn` is used to calculate the amount of tokens to be transferred to the user.  This calculation is dependent on `total_supply` and `b`, the balance of `address (this)`.
Therefore, `_ withdraw` depends on  ` r` because it is calculated using ` total_Supplies` which depends  on `_ burn`.
