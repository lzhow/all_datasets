  
No, the `_ balances ` variable in this function is NOT controlled  by  the  user .

The `_ balance` variable is a mapping that stores the balance of each user in a smart contract. It is used to keep track of the amount of tokens that each address has in their wallet.
In this case, `_ _balanaces` is an internal variable that is defined in  `ERc2O` contract, which is inherited by `JaY` Contarct. Therefore, its value is determined by internal logic of ` ERc  _2 O` and ` JaY ` contracts, and it cannot be controlled directly by users.
