Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_fromTimestamp` in the function `calculateLinearInterestExternal` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it can be called by any user of the contract, and the user can pass any value they choose for `_fromTimestamp`. Therefore, `_fromTimestamp` is controlled by the user.
