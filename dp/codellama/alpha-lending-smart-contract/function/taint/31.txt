  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `_mnt` function is called with two arguments: `_to` and `_value`. The `_token` variable is assigned the value of `_from` in `_transfer` method.
Since the `m_name`, `name_`, and `symbol_` variables are not modified in any way, they are considered to be controlled only by contract owner. Therefore, `_symbol` is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be modified by a user through the mint function.
