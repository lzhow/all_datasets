Reason: The variable `_p_scope_0` in the function `updateFees` is a local variable that is used to calculate the new fee values based on the latest price from the `priceFeed`. It is not directly modifying the state variable `_balances`, which is part of the ERC20 token contract's state that tracks the token balances of each address. The `_balances` state variable would typically be modified by functions that transfer tokens, such as `_mint` or `_burn`, and is not affected by the fee calculation logic within `updateFees`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_balances` and `_p_scope_0`.
