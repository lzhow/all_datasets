Reason: The variable `cToken` in the function `mintAllowed` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is meant to be called from outside the contract, typically by a user or another contract. Therefore, the value of `cToken` is controlled by the user who calls the function, as they specify the argument when initiating the transaction.
