  
No, the variables ` absolute InputAmount ` and ` token ` in function` get AbsolutInput Ammount ` are independent.

The variable` absolute input amount ` is calculated in ` get absoluteinput amount` function and is not dependent on any other variable. On the other hand, ` Token ` variable is a parameter of the ` emit executed` method and it is dependent only on ` input ` parameter. Therefore, there is no data dependence between ` AbosluteInputamount `and `Token` variables.
