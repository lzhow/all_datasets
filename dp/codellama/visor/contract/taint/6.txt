In this case, the `isContrac` function takes an `address` parameter `_addr` and returns a `bool` indicating whether the contract at that address has a non-zero `extcodeszie`. The `assembly` keyword is used to access the low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) instructions, which allows the code to interact with the EVM directly.
  The variable size is a local variable in this function, and it's not clear whether it can be controlled directly by a user or not. It' s possible that the value of size can change based on the input parameter _ addr, but it depends on how the assembly code interacts with other parts of the smart contract.
