Explanation: The variable `reserveA` in the function `_addLiquidity` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value returned by the `OrionMultiPoolLibrary.getReserves` function, which is an internal function and does not take any user input. Therefore, the variable `reserveA` is not controlled by the user.
