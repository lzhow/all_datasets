  
No, the ` actual Repay Amount` variable in `liquideBorroweFres` is not dependent on ` vars` variables in  ` seiseInternal`.

The reason is that the  variable  is defined in a different function, and it is passed as an argument to the other function. Therefore, it does not have any data dependence relationship with the variables defined within the same function or any other functions.
