   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to understand if I should use it in my own projects or not. Thanks!
  
    An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This makes it easier for the browser to load the application and makes the initial load time faster.

    The main benefit of using an incremental tool like Webpack is that it allows developers to write their code in modular fashion, with each module containing code for a specific feature of the app. Webpack takes care of bundLING these modules into one file, while also performing other tasks like minifying the code, optimizing the assets, and generating source maps for debugging.

Webpack works by analyzing the dependencies between the modules and figuring out what needs to be included in each bundle. It uses a graph-based approach to do
