The variable `_amount` in the `burn` function of the `BTCToken` contract is controlled by the user. This is because the `burn` function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called by any external account or contract. The `_amount` parameter is passed to the function by the caller, who decides its value. Therefore, `_amount` is user-controlled.
