Yes

The variable `from` in the function `deposit` is an address type parameter that is passed to the function by the caller. Since the caller specifies the value of `from` when they call the function, it is controlled by the user. The function does not impose any restrictions on what the `from` address can be, other than it must not be the zero address or the contract's own address. Therefore, the user has control over the value of `from`.
