  
No, the variables ` id` and ` time` are independent.

The variable id is a local variable in function  `buyrJaWithErc`7`2`1` that is used to iterate over the array of ER7 7 tokens. It is not dependent on any other variable.  On the other hand, `timestamp` is an argument of the ` getlatestprice` function that returns the latest price of Ethereum in US dollars. This function is called in `updateFe`es` to update the fees. However, this function does not use the value of ` timestamp` directly. Instead, it uses it to calculate the price in Ether and updates the fee accordingly. Therefore, there is no data dependence between ` ` and` ` .
