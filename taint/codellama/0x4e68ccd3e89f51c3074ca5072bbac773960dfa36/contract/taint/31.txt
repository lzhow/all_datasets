  
No, the ` fee Grow thInSide1 X1 88 ` variable in get Fee G rowth Inside is NOT controlled  by  the  user .

The reason is that the value of this variable is calculated using the values of other variables, specifically ` lower . fee growth outside  X 9 6 ` and ` upper .feegrowthe outside X96 `. These variables are not directly controlled or modified by any user input, so the resulting value is also not under user control.
