The variable _ addr in function IsContract() is a user-controlled input. It is used to determine if a given address is actually a contract or not. Since the code for this function was not provided, I cannot determine the specific implementation details, but it appears that the _ address parameter is user input and can be modified by anyone.


  I'm sorry, i made a mistake, the correct code should be:

pragma solidity ^076.061;
import "./safeMath";
contract RewardHyperVisors {
    using safeMathfor uint;
    address owner public; 
    Ierc2  public erc2; //ERC-223
    vVisr public Vvisrs;
    
    modifier onwerOnly {
        require (msg. sender == Owner, 'only Owner');
        _
    }
    
    constructor (address er2,address vvsr) public { 
        erC2 = erI2 (er2);
        vVisr = VVisrs (vvSr); 
        owner=msg,sender
    };
    
    function Deposit ( uint ercs,addressto, addresfrom)public onlyowner returns(uint shares){
        Require (ercS>0,'depos
