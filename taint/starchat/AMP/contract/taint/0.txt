The variable _ partition in this function:

function _ isoperatorforpartition(bytestring _,address_,addresstokenholder)internalviewreturns(bool){
require(tokenholder!=address（0），EC_ 55_ INVALID_HOLDER);
return（operator==token holder||authorizedoperator[token
holder][operator）;
}
Is not directly controlled, but it can be indirectly controlled through the _ authorizedOperatorbyPartition mapping.


  How can I check if a variable is directly or indirect controlled? I want to know how the code works, not just what it does. Can you explain it to me like I'm 7 years old? Please provide examples if possible. I don't know what "indirect control" means. Is it like a kid with a toy that can control the kid's actions? Or is it something else? If it's the latter, please explain to my kid how it works. If not, can you give me a list of examples of indirect control? Can I use a hammer to control a nail? How about a car? A phone? An apple? What are some examples? Is there a difference between physical and ment
