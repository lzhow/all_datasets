The variable denominator in getAmoutOut() is user-controlled. It is used to calculate the amount of input token that will be returned to the caller. This value is derived from the reserves of the input and output tokens in a pair.

In the case of Unipool, the denominator is calculated as follows:
(a) The input amount is multiplied by 2 (to account for the fee) and stored in amountWithFees.  This is done using the formula:  amount * (1 - fee).
 (b) Then, we calculate reserve in and reserve out using getReserve() function. 
 (c) Finally, using formula (a)/(b), we get the value of denominator.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was a 5 year old. If that's not possible, could you maybe explain some of it in simpler terms? Maybe with a flow chart? If you don't know how to do that, please tell me. Thank you!
