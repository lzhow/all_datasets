  

The variable 'new Admin' in change Admin function is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled or manipulated by a user in this function.
This is because the new admin address is passed as an argument to the change admin function, which can then be used to change the address of the current admin. This means that the value of new Admin can potentially be changed by an attacker who calls this method. Therefore, the 'New Admin ' variable is considered to be under the control of a malicious user and is therefore labled as "Yes".
