The contract variable nftBougth is not directly data-dependent on total, but it is indirectly data dependendent.

In the buyNfts function, the total variable is used to calculate the amount of ether required to purchase the NFTs. This amount is then compared to the value of msg, which represents the ether sent with the transaction. If the sent ether is less than the calculated amount, then the require statement will fail, and the entire transaction will be reverted.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are calculated?
 
  Sure! The data flow analysis in Solidty is based on a static analysis of the code. It tracks the flow of data through the program and determines whether each variable depends on any other variables. Here's how it works:

1. Solidit starts by initializing a set of "entry" variables, typically the input parameters of a function. These variables are marked as "read" and "written" by the analysis.

2. Then, it iterates through each statement in your code, looking for assignments and function calls. For each assignment, Solidi updates the "write" set for the left-hand side of each equation, while it updates both the
