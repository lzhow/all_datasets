   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on. I also want to use this as an opportunity to improve my english skills, which I struggle with sometimes. Could you recommend me some good first steps? Also, is there a better place to ask questions like this? Thanks!



  Hi there! It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how best to approach learning Python. Here are some tips that might help you:

1. Start with the basics: If you've never written a line of code, it's a great idea to start with some simple programs that demonstrate the basic syntax and concepts. Try to understand how the code works line by line, rather than trying to absorb it all at once. This will help make the concepts more concrete and easier to grasp.

2. Practice regularly: Learning a new language takes time
