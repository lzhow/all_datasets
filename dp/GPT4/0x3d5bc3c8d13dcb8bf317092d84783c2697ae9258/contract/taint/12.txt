Reason: The variable `redeemTokens` in the function `redeemAllowed` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is meant to be called from outside the contract, typically by a user or another contract. The value of `redeemTokens` is provided by the caller of the function, which means it is controlled by the user who initiates the transaction.
