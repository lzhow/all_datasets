Label: No

Reason: The variable `newPendingAdmin` in the function `_setPendingAdmin` is indeed provided as an argument to the function, which suggests that it could be user-controlled. However, the function contains a check `if (msg.sender != admin)` that only allows the current `admin` to successfully call this function and set a new `pendingAdmin`. Since `admin` is initially set to the address that deploys the contract (`msg.sender` in the constructor), and only the current `admin` can change `admin` or `pendingAdmin`, this means that not just any user can control this variable. Only the specific user who is the current `admin` has control over setting `newPendingAdmin`. Therefore, it is not generally user-controlled, but controlled by a specific privileged user (the current admin).
