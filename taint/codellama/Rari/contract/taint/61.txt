  
No, the `__ admin` variable in this function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a private variable and it can only be accessed by internal functions.

The `__ administrator` is a variable that stores the address of the administrator of this contract. It is set to the zero address by default, and can be changed by calling the `_setAdmin` function. However, this variable is private and cannot be directly accessed or modified by external users. Therefore, `__ administrators` are not considered controlled variables.
