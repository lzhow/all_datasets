Explanation: The contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `buyERC1155`. This is because the variable `amount` is being updated in the for loop by adding the `amounts[id]` value to it. The updated value of `amount` is then used as an argument in the `safeTransferFrom` function, which suggests that it is being used to modify the state of `_balances`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_balances` and `amount`.
