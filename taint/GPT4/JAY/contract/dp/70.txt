No, the variable `ids` in the function `buyJayWithERC721` is not data dependent on the variable `eth` in the function `sell`. 

The reason is that the variable `ids` is used as a parameter in the `buyJayWithERC721` function to transfer ERC721 tokens, while the variable `eth` in the `sell` function is used to calculate the amount of ETH to transfer. These two variables are used in different functions and serve different purposes, so there is no direct data dependency between them.
