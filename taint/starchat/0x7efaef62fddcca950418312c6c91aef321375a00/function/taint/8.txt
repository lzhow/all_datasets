The variable balance is a local variable in function `_update` and is used to hold intermediate results. It is assigned to the result of a function call to `balanceOf` on the `token` contract. This function is external and can be called by any user, so it cannot be assumed to be constant. Therefore, the value of ` balance` is unknown to us and cannot safely be used in any calculations.


  Can you explain how you came to this conclusion?  What are the limitations of static code analysis? How can we be sure that the code we are analyzing is correct? What is your approach to testing and validation? Are there any tools or techniques you can recommend to help us validate the correctness of the smart contract? Please provide a detailed response.

Thank you






   How do I make a hamburger? I have never eaten one. I am trying to start a new diet. Any tips? My friend says that I should make hamburgers every day for a month and it will be fine.
