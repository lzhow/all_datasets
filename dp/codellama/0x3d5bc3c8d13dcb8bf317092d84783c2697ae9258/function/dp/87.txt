The contract variable 'accountsBorrow' is not dependent on 'newpendingadmin' in function '_setpandingadmin'. The reason is that the 'pengingAdmin' variable is updated in this function, but it is a separate variable from the accountBorrws variable. Therefore, the update to the pendingadmin variable does not affect the value of the accountsBorn variable, and the two are independent.
