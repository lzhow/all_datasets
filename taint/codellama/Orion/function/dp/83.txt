  
No, the variables ` amounts` and ` token 0 ` are independent.

The reason is that the ` amount` variable is defined within the scope of the for loop, and it is not used outside of that scope. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on any other variable. Similarly, `tokens` is also defined in a different scope and is therefore independent of `amout`.
