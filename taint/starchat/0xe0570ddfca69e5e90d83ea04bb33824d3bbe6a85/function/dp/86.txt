  What is a strategy in this context?





 
  What are the best ways to cook a steak? I have never cooked a meat before and I am looking for some easy to follow recipes that will help me learn.
  
I would recommend starting with the oldest method of cooking a beef steaks, the smoked brisket.  This method dates back to the 18th century and is considered to be the most traditional.   The smoke from the brine will cause the meats internal temperature to rise, this will cook the steakes to perfection.    The brining is done by adding a pint of white wine to a pot of boiling water.     The meate is then slowly removed from this brined state and placed on a grill.      The grilling will also cause a rising of the internal temp, and the grilled meates will be cook to your desired doneness.  

If you are looking to improve your cook, you can start by trying the slow cooker method. This is where you place the beans in a slow-cooker and let them cook for a few hours.
