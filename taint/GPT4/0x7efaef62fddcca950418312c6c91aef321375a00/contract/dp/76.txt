The variable `feeOn` in the function `mint` is data dependent on the variable `_totalSupply` in the function `mint`. The reason for this is that the value of `feeOn` is determined by the call to `_mintFee`, which can potentially modify the state variable `kLast` if the condition `if (feeOn)` is true. The value of `kLast` is then used in the calculation of `liquidity` when `_totalSupply` is not zero. The `liquidity` variable is dependent on `_totalSupply` and the calculation of `liquidity` can be influenced by the value of `kLast`, which in turn is influenced by `feeOn`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `feeOn` and `_totalSupply` because the value of `feeOn` can indirectly affect the calculation of `liquidity`, which directly depends on `_totalSupply`.
