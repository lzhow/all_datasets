The contract variable `_notEntered` is not used in `if` statement, so it is impossible to say if it has a direct or indirect data dependence on `Permit` struct.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to ask if the state `not_entered` has any data dependencies on any of the other variables in this function. Could you please check again?
  
  The state variable not_entred is only used to check if a certain condition is met, and it does not affect the behavior of any other part of this contract. Therefore, it cannot have any direct data or control dependencies. However, the variables token, eth, call, or account could potentially be used as part or all of a complex expression that depends on notEntered, which could result in indirect dependencies between these variables and notEnterd.

To determine if any variables have indirect or direct dependencies, you would need to perform a more thorough analysis of all the code in your contract, including all possible paths through the program. This would require a significant amount of time and resources, but it would be possible to identify and analyze these dependencies using automated tools. Additionally, manual analysis can be time-consuming and error
