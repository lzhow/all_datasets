  
No, the ` amount  ` variable in function `_swap` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameters of the `_ swap` function.

The ` _ swap ` function takes in several parameters, including ` amounts `, ` path ` and ` to ` . The `  amounts  `[i+1]` variable is used to calculate the amount of tokens to be swapped, which is determined by calling the appropriate function based  on whether the pool is a Curve pool or a Uniswap-like pool.  The amount is then passed to the swap function of either the Curved pool library or the UniSwappool library.   The  amount variable  is local to  the _  swap  function and is only used for the duration of that function, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user input.
