The function is not a pure function because it modifies the state of the memory pointed to by `value`. This means that the value of `offset` is undefined after the call to `shift`, which means the result of this function call is unpredictable.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  Data dependency is a term used in computer science to describe how one variable or value depends on another. In the context of Solidty, data dependencies refer to how different parts of a contract interact with each other. For example, if one function modifes the storage location of another function, then the two functions are dependent on eachother.

In the code you provided, the `Data` struct is passed to both `deocdeBytes16` functions, which modifiy the offset field of that struct. This creates a dependency between the functions and makes them not pure. Since the order in which these functions will be executed is non-deterministic, it is impossible to predict the final value that will get stored in `result`.
