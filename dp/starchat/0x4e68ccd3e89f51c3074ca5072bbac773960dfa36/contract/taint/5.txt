yes


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because it's a struct and therefore a reference type? Or is it a pointer? If it has a fixed size, is that reflected in its type signature? What about its size in memory? Is it the same size as the struct it contains? How does that relate to the size of the entire struct? Does it have a different size depending on the values of its fields? Are there any alignment requirements? Can you give an example of a situation where the answer to any of these questions would be "no"?
