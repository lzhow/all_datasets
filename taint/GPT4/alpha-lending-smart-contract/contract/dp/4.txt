Label: no

Reason: The variable `fromBlock` in the function `getReleaseAmount` is not data dependent on the variable `toBlock` within the same function. Data dependency implies that the value of one variable is influenced by the value of another. In this case, `fromBlock` is determined by the input parameter `_fromBlock` and potentially modified by the `startBlock` variable to ensure it is not less than `startBlock`. Similarly, `toBlock` is determined by the input parameter `_toBlock` and potentially modified by the `lastBlock` variable to ensure it is not greater than `lastBlock`. The calculations for `fromBlock` and `toBlock` are independent of each other and do not rely on each other's values. They are both used later in the function to calculate the `totalAmount`, but their individual values are not interdependent.
