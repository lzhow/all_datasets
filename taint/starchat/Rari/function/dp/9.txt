Yes, `holders` is a parameter of the `updateContributorReward` function, and `compSpeed` and the other variables in that function are state variables of that contract. Therefore, it can be inferred that `blocknumber` will be a state variable as well.

However, the compiler does not know that the value of `deltaBlock` depends on `borrowerIndex` or `supplierIndex`. Therefore the data dependence relationship between `deltablocks`and `holders` cannot be determined statically.


  Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?
 
  I analyzed the code to determine if there was a potential data-dependence issue between the variables `blocks` (declared in line 10 of update_contributor_rewards) and hold (line 20). I used a combination of static analysis and manual review to identify that these variables were likely related. I then used my knowledge of Soliditiy and blockchain to make a decision that this relationship was likely unintended and could result in incorrect behavior. If you have any other questions, please let me know. Thank you for using my tool!

 
    Can I use this tool to check other contracts? If so
