Label: no

Reason: The variable `scalar` in the function `divScalarByExp` is a local variable and its scope is limited to the `divScalarByExp` function itself. It is not used or modified outside of this function. The function `mulExp3` does not reference or modify `scalar` in any way, nor does it pass `scalar` as an argument to any function calls within it. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `scalar` in `divScalarByExp` and any variable in `mulExp3`. Data dependency would require that the value of one variable affects the computation or value of another, which is not the case here.
