Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `tick` in the function `position` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function. However, without further context, it is not possible to determine if the value of `tick` is controlled by the user or if it is derived from user-controlled variables or inputs. Therefore, the label is "unknown".
