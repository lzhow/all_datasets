  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `return` statement is dependent on `output` and `total_fee_share`.
`total fee share` is calculated by adding `marketplace_F` to ` protocol_f`.  `
protocol_ fee` has a value of `calldataprotocol_ F` which is a parameter of the same function.
Therefore, `Protocol_amount` depends on both `Output`and `Total_Fees_Shares`.
