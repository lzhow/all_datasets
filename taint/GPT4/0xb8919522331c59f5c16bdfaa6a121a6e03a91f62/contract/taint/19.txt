The variable `admin_` in the constructor of the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract is controlled by the user. When a contract is deployed, the constructor is executed, and the parameters for the constructor are provided by the user who is deploying the contract. In this case, the `admin_` parameter is set by the user during the deployment process, and it determines the initial admin address for the proxy contract. This admin address is then used to control certain administrative functions of the proxy, such as upgrading the contract or changing the admin. Therefore, the initial value of `admin_` is indeed controlled by the user.
