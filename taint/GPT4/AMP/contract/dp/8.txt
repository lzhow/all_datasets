Reason: The contract state `totalSupplyByPartition` is data dependent on the variable `_value` in the function `transferFrom`. This is because the `transferFrom` function internally calls `_transferByDefaultPartition`, which in turn calls `_transferByPartition`. Within `_transferByPartition`, the `_removeTokenFromPartition` and `_addTokenToPartition` functions are called, which update the `totalSupplyByPartition` mapping based on the `_value` that is being transferred. Specifically, the `totalSupplyByPartition[_partition]` is decreased by `_value` in `_removeTokenFromPartition` and increased by `_value` in `_addTokenToPartition`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `totalSupplyByPartition` and `_value` as changes to `_value` will result in changes to `totalSupplyByPartition`.
