The variable result is data-dependent on amount in both functions.

In the first function, result depends on asset address and amount, but not on itself. This is because the if-else statement is executed based on whether assetaddress is equal to address 0 or not. If assetAddres is not equal, then the result variable is assigned a value based solely on its own value, which does not depend on either asset Address or amount variables. However, if assetAdress is  equal  to  address  0,  then  the  result  variable  is then assigned the value of the expression result=amount.Mul( 1  E  8  ).Div(  1   Ether  ),  which  depends  on  both  asset  Address  and  amount  variables, and thus is also data dependend on both of them.


  Can you explain why the second function is dependent on result?
 
  The second `function` is indeed dependent upon the `variable` ` result`. The reason for this is that the code within the curly braces of this function contains a reference to the previously declared ` variable` result. Specifically, the line `require( result <
