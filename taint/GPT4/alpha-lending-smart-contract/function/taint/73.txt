The variable a in function `waddiv` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a is determined by dividing two user-controlled variables, `x` and `y`. Therefore, a can be considered to be indirectly controlled.


  How can I tell if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a way to determine if it's a user control variable or not?

I'm writing a tool that will analyze Solidty code to identify potential security vulnerabilities. One of the key features of my tool is to detect if any variables in a contract are user controllable. I need a list of criteria that can help me determine whether a given variable in Soliditty is controll by a human user or if not, if can still be controled by other contracts or by blockchain itself.
Can you please provide me with such a criteria list? Please provide one criteria per line and sort the criteria from most strict to most lax. Also, please explain in detail how to use each criteria and why it should be used. For example, "A variable should not be user contrrollable if..."





   What is a good way of pronouncing
