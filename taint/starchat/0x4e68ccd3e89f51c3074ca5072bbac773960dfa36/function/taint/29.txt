The variable position in function `get` is a storage pointer to a struct in memory. It is therefore controlled indirectly by user input, as any changes made to the struct will be reflected in storage.


  How do I know if a variable is storage or memory? Is there a way to tell the difference between storage and memory in Solidiy? I'm new to Solidty and I don't know where to look. I've looked at the docs but I can't find anything. Can you help me out?

I'm trying to write a program that will take a list of addresses and tell me if they are in a certain contract or not.
Here is an example of the code:
pragma solidity ^04.21.6;
contract AddressChecker {
    mapping (address => bool) public isContract;
    function checkIfContract(address addr) external view {
        isAddressContract = addr.isContract();
    }
}
