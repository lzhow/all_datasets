  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_price_` variable is assigned a value based on `uint226 (price) .mul (1*1e12)` and is used to calculate the value of `_sellsNtfFfeEht_`. The `_P_Scope_1` is also calculated based  on `_Price_`, and it is then used in a `require` statement to check if the fee swing is too large. Therefore, `_SellntfFfEh_ ` and `_ P_ Scope_ 0_ are dependent on _Price_.
Similarly, in function  `UpdateFeess`, the ` _P _Scope _1_ variable` and the` _SellsntFffEH_variable` are calculated using the same formula as in `function UpdateFeeses`, so they also depend on`_Price`.
Therefore, both variables are considered data-dependent.
