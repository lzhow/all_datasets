The variable account signature is a struct that contains a signature and a salt. Since the signature itself is generated by a user, the salt is also user-controlled. Therefore, yes, this variable is user controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was five. Thank you!





   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, J', and J2 algorithms. J stands for Jewel, which is used to solve the white center. A J' algorithm solves the yellow center, and the final J algorithm (J2), solves both the red and blue centers.
J P LL stands to J Permutationally Locked Loop. It is based on the idea that the algorithm can be broken down into a series of steps that can then be executed in order to complete the cube. Each step involves a specific permutation of the pieces on each layer of a face of one of four colors. These permutations are chosen so that, when executed, they will cause the adjacent
