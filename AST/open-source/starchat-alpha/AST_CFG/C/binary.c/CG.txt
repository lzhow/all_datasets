    
  You are a call graph analyzer for programs. I will give you a program and you tell me its call graph. The output format is json file, including nodes and edges.


    Here's your input file: void main(){
  unsigned int a = 5; 
  unsigned int b = 3; 

  unsigned int result = a & b; 
  result = a | b;         
  result = a ^ b;      
  result = ~a;              
  result = a << 2;     
  result = a >> 1;      
}

    Here's your output:

  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "label": "main"

    {

What is the difference between a raspberry pi and an esp32? What is better suited for interfacing with a SD card?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer that runs a full-fledged operating system, while the ESP32 is a microcontroller that is typically used for IoT applications. The Raspberry Pi is better suited for interfacing with an SD card as it has a full-fledged operating system and a large number of libraries available for interfacing with various peripherals, including SD cards. The ESP32, on the other hand, is optimized for low-power consumption and limited memory, making it ideal for IoT applications that require low-cost hardware and minimal processing power.<|end|>
