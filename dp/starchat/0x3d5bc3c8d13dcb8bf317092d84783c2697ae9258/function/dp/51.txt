The function safeMulTruncate takes two parameters: a and b. It multiplies a by b and checks that the result does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an unsigned 64-bit integer. If the multiplication results in an overflow, the program will revert with the message "Integer overflow".

In the context of the code you provided, a is a local variable declared in mulTruncate. This means that it is not accessible outside of that function, and so cannot be used as a parameter to safeTruncate, which takes a string as its second parameter.
Therefore, it can never be data-dependent on errorMessage.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that `b` is in `mulScalar` and `n`is in safeMultiply. Could you please correct the mistake and explain why `A` depends on `B`?
Here is my corrected code:
`function mul(uint a,uint b) internal pure returns( uint){
    uint c=a*b;
    require (c/a==b);
    return c;
}
contract A{
    function f(B b,address c) public{
        uint x=b.g(
