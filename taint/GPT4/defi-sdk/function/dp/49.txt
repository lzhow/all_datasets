  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `amountOut` variable is calculated using the current value of `i` and the value stored in `pair[currentValueOfI]`. Therefore, `amoutOut ` is data-dependent on ` pairs`.
Similarly, in function two,  the  ` amountOut  variable` is also calculated based on  current  value  of  i  and  stored  values  from  pairs  array.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on pairs array and length variable.
