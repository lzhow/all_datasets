  
The variable 'receip' in function 'claim' is 'No'. The reason is that the 'recipt' variable is a struct variable that is defined in a different contract. It is created in another contract and passed as an argument to the claim function. Therefore, the value of the receip variable cannot be controlled directly by a user and is considered 'Unknown'.
