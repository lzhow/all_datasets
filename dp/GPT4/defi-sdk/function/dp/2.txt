Reason: The variable `amount` in the function `depositEth` is an input parameter that is used to make a deposit to the WETH contract. It is not influenced by any external state or variables outside of the `depositEth` function scope. On the other hand, the variable `amountsIn` in the function `getAmountsIn` is a local variable that is calculated within the function based on its input parameters `amountOut`, `pairs`, and `directions`. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `amount` and `amountsIn` as they are used in separate functions with no shared state or values being passed between them. The `depositEth` function does not call `getAmountsIn` nor does it use `amountsIn` in any way, and vice versa. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
