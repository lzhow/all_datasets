As I am a language model trained on a large corpus of code and text, my answer may not always be accurate, but with the patch above, I can provide an answer to this question. 

While it is possible to transform the first code to the second code using a diff patch, there is still significant semantic difference between the original code vs the mutated code. This suggests that the codes provided are **not** semantic equal, and that you should not replace the old code with this new code without careful consideration.
