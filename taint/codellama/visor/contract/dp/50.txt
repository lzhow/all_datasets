There is no direct data dependence between the `variable value` and the`success variable`in the functions ` function CallWith Value`and `Function Delegate Call`.
However, the value of the success variable is used in a conditional expression in function callWith value.
If the condition is true, then the return value is returned. If the conditional is false, an error message is thrown. In this case, there is a potential data flow from the error variable to the result variable. However, this is not a direct dependency.
