  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `getOrigin` function, the `_t` variable is assigned the result of the call to `Assimbilate.getAssimiator` with the arguments `_origin` and `_target`. The `assimbilation` object returned by this function contains a reference to the curve object, which is passed as an argument to both `curves` functions.
Therefore, `_cur` is data-dependent on `_ass` because it is used to calculate the value of `_amt` which in turn is returned as the output of ` viewRawAmmount`
