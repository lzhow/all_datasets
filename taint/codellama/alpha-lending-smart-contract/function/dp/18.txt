Explanation:
In the `getUserCompondedBorrrowBalnce` function, the local variable  ` userborrowsSharess` is assigned the value of the field `borroShre` of a struct `UserPool` which is a field of another struct called `Pool`. The ` Pool` struct is defined in another function called  'calculateroundupborrrowshareamount'. The function  calculaterounupbordrowsharamount is called in getusercompoundedborrownbalance. Therefore, ` pool` and ` borrowsshare` are dependent on each other.
