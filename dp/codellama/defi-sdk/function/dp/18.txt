  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `execute` function, the value of `input.inputAmount`, which is passed as an argument to the internal function call `handleInput`, is used to calculate the new balance of the input token. This balance is then used in a subsequent transfer operation.
On the other hand, in ` get AbsolutInput Amout`, the amount is calculated based on a number of factors, including the token amount, amount type, and account. However, it is not directly used as a parameter in any transfer or other operation that would affect the balance. Therefore, ` absolute Input Ammount` is data-dependent on ` amount` because it depends on it to determine its value.
