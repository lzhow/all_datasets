The variable _ENTED is a private variable in ReentrancyGuarded contract. It is used to prevent reentrance attack.  The variable is set to true when the contract is entered and set back to false when it exits. Therefore, the value of _ENETERD is determined by internal logic of the smart contract and is therefore not under the control of user input.
