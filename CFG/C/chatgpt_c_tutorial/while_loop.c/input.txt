You are a C Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  C code file. You give me its 
        AST in Json. Each AST node only has three attributes, children, type and value.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        #include <stdio.h>


int main(void)
{
    int a = 0;
    while (a < 100){
        a += 1;
    }
}
        ```
