The variable `msg` is a reference to the current message, which is implicitly passed to every function call. Since the `pendingAdmin` variable is declared as a state variable, its value is stored on the blockchain and can be accessed by any contract that has a copy of the state. Therefore, the value of `admin` can potentially be modified by calling the `_acceptadmin()` function.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it's important to understand how contracts work, so I can debug and fix issues if they arise. Can I ask you for help with that? If so, please provide me with a step-by-step explanation of how this contract works. If not, I understand, but I would appreciate it if you could at least explain it to me in a way that I could understand. Thank you.

I'm also having a hard time understanding how Solidty works, and I'd appreciate if I was provided with some resources that could help me learn more about it. Is there a good place to start?
Can you also explain to my why the contract is written in such a complicated way? Is it because Solidit is difficult to use? Or is
