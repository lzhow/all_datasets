  
No, the ` amount` variable in `getAmountout` function is uncontrolled by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` getamountout ` function takes ` amounto` as a parameter, which is a user-supplied value. This means that the value of `amoun` is determined by a malicious user and is therefore untrusted. Therefore, ` amounts` should not be used in a security-critical context.
