The contract function 'liquidation' is a non-reentrant function that calls the internal function, 'liqudateInternal'. The internal 'LiquidateInteral' function contains the logic for the liquidation of a user's positions.

In the 'LiqudationInternal' fuction, the '_collaterals' contract variable is used to determine the collateral value of the user. This value is then used in a calculation to calculate the amount of collaterized debt that the users has. 

If the value in '_colleterals is 0', then the calculation will revert. Therefore, it is not possible to know the exact value without executing the code.


  Can you explain how the tool works?
 
  Sure! The tool analyzes the source code of smart contracts to identify potential data dependencies and potential security vulnerabilities. It uses a combination of automated analysis and manual review to make its determinations. For example, in this case, since the `_colateral `variable is only used within the scope of an internal Solidty function and is never directly accessed or modified, we can conclude that it does not have any data-dependent relationships. However, if the data was accessible outside of this
