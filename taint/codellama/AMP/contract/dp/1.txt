  
No, the variables ` sender Implementation ` and ` to Partitions Prefix ` are independent in this code.

The variable `_sender Implementations` is assigned in line 211 of the code, which is inside the `_transerBy Partiton` function. This function takes in a parameter `_to Partion` and uses it to determine the value of `_ sender implementation`. The value is determined by calling the `interfaceAddrs` method, passing in `_from` as the first parameter and `_amp Tokens Sender`as the second parameter.  The ` _ampToksSender` variable is a string that is defined in lines 3-4 of this function, and it is not dependent on `_ to partitions prefix`.
  On the other hand, `_tot partitions PREFIX`is defined on line123 of code in function`_callpostTransfersHooKs`. This variable depends on` _totpartitons` which was defined earlier in code on lines130-140 of function `transfersBypartition`.  This means that the values of`sender implementation`and`tot partition prefix`are independent.
