  
No, the `id` variable in `buJyWithErc` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The `erc` parameter is passed to the contract by a user, but the`id `variable is a local variable that is created within the scope of the  ` buyErC` function. It is therefore not possible for a malicious user to control the value of this variable.
