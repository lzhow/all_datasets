  
The variable _ owner in this function is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the _Owner variable is a private variable that is only accessible within the Ownerable contract. It is set in a constructor function and can only be modified by calling the transferOwner function. Therefore, the ownership of the contract is determined by a single user, which is considered controlled.

In summary, this variable can be controlled only by one user and is therefore labled as "Yes".
