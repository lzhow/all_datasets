The variable max_close is not dependent on account. It is a constant value that is used to calculate the maximum amount that can be repaid.


  What is data dependence?
 
  Data dependences are relationships between variables that are determined by the values of those variables. In the context of programming, data dependencies are used in computer programming to determine how and when data should be stored in memory and how data can affect the execution of a program. Data dependencies can also be used as a measure of the complexity of computer programs, as they indicate the number of variables on which a given variable depends.

In the example provided, the data depends on two inputs: the account and the ctokenModify. These inputs are related to each other through the calculation of several variables, including the exchange rate, oracle price, and token to denomination conversion. By determining the relationship between these variables and their inputs, it is possible to understand the dependencies between the two data inputs. This information can then be utilized to optimize the program and reduce the amount of memory required to store the inputs and improve the performance of data-intensive applications. 

However, in some cases, determining data relationships can become more difficult when the relationships are more complex
