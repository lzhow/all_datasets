In the `getAccountsnapshot` function, the local variable  ` merr` is assigned the result of the call to the internal function  borrowbalancestoredinternal. This function returns a tuple containing two values: the first is a Math error, and the second is an unsigned integer.
  The variable mError is not directly dependent on any other variable in this function. However, it is possible that the value of merror is dependent upon the return value from the borrow balance stored internal.  This is because the error value is returned as the  first element of a two-element tuple. If the tuple is unpacked, then the m error variable will be assigned a value based on whether the un packing was successful or not. In this case, if the Math Error is NO_Error, m Error will have the same value as error. Therefore, we cannot say for certain whether m err is data-dependent on error without knowing more about the implementation of borrow balancestore internal and how it uses error to determine the returned value.
