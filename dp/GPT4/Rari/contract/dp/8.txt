Explanation: The variable `dripped_` in the function `drip` is data dependent on the variable `deltaDrip_` in the same function. This can be observed from the line `uint drippedNext_ = add(dripped_, toDrip_, "tautological");` where the value of `dripped_` is used as an input to the `add` function along with `toDrip_`. Since `toDrip_` is calculated based on the value of `deltaDrip_`, any change in the value of `deltaDrip_` will affect the value of `toDrip_` and consequently the value of `dripped_`. Therefore, there is a data dependency between `dripped_` and `deltaDrip_`.
