The variable `shares` in the function `deposit` is data dependent on the variable `visrDeposit`. This is evident from the line `shares = visrDeposit;` where `shares` is directly assigned the value of `visrDeposit`. Additionally, the value of `shares` may be modified later in the function based on the total supply of `vvisr` and the balance of `visr`, but the initial assignment shows a clear data dependency relationship between `shares` and `visrDeposit`.
