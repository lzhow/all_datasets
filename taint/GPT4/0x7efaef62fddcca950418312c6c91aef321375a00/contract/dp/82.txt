Reason: The variable `amount1` in the function `mint` is used to calculate the amount of liquidity to mint based on the balance of token1 (`balance1`) and the reserves (`_reserve1`). It is calculated as follows:

```solidity
uint amount1 = balance1.sub(_reserve1);
```

On the other hand, the variable `balance1Adjusted` in the function `swap` is used to ensure that the invariant K for the liquidity pool is maintained after a swap operation. It is calculated as follows:

```solidity
uint balance1Adjusted = (balance1.mul(10000).sub(amount1In.mul(25)));
```

These two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions. `amount1` is related to the minting process of liquidity tokens, while `balance1Adjusted` is related to the swapping process and ensuring the K invariant. There is no direct data dependency between `amount1` and `balance1Adjusted` as they are calculated independently of each other using different inputs and in separate transactions. The state of `balance1Adjusted` does not influence the calculation of `amount1` in any way, and vice versa.
