The variable `absoluteInputAmount` in the function `emitExecuted` is data dependent on the variable `token` in the function `getAbsoluteInputAmount`. The reason for this is that `absoluteInputAmount` is calculated within the `execute` function based on the result of `getAbsoluteInputAmount`, which in turn uses the `token` variable to determine the amount of tokens to be used in the transaction. The `token` variable is part of the `TokenAmount` struct, which is passed to `getAbsoluteInputAmount` and is used to calculate the `absoluteTokenAmount` based on the type of amount (absolute or relative to the balance). This calculated amount is then used in the `execute` function and eventually passed to `emitExecuted` as `absoluteInputAmount`, establishing a direct data dependency relationship between the two variables.
