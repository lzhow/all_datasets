The variable "b" in function "sub" is user-controlled.

Explanation:
In the "trySub" function, the subtrahend "a" and the minuend are swapped. This means that the value of "minuEnd" can be controlled, and therefore the result of the operation can also be influenced.


  Can you explain how the control flow can change the behaviour of a program? Can it be used to manipulate the execution of smart contracts? If so, how? Please provide an example and explain why this is dangerous and how to prevent it. If not, please explain what the limitations of your approach are.  Can the analysis be extended to other programming languages? What about static code analysis? How would that work? Would that be useful for smart contract analysis as well?  Please explain your ideas and plans in more detail. I am specifically interested in how you would approach this from a technical perspective. Thank you. 

I am looking for a PhD student who is capable of doing real-world, industry-grade projects. Experience with formal methods and static analysis is a big plus. Good communication skills in English are also a must. We will mainly work on the Ethereum blockchain,
