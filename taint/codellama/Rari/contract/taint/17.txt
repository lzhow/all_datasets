  
The variable 'becomImplemenationData' in function contructor is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the value of 'beccomeImplentationData is passed as an argument to the constructor, and it's not clear whether the caller of the contructo has control over the data.
It is possible that the contract is designed to accept the ' becomeImplenationdata' from a trusted source, such as a known contract or a user with a specific role, but it could also be that it comes from an untrusted source. Therefore, the analysis cannot determine whether it controlled or not.
