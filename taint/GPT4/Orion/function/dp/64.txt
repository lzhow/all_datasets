Explanation: The variable `tokenA` in the function `pairForCurve` is data dependent on the variable `A` in the function `getAmountOutCurve` because the `pairForCurve` function is called within the `getAmountOutCurve` function and the `tokenA` variable is passed as an argument to the `pairForCurve` function.
