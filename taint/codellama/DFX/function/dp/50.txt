  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_bal` variable is used to calculate the value of `_feemargin` and `_delta`, which are then used in calculating the `threshhold` value. Therefore, `_idealfee_margin` is data-dependent on `bal`.
Similarly, in function 2, `ideafee`is used for calculating `_margin_thresold` which is then datadependent of `delta`. Therefore the answer is yes.
