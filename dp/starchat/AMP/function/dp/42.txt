The answer is no.

In the `_calPretransferHooks` function, the `senderImplemenation` variable is assigned the value of the address of `AMP_TOKENS_SENER`. This address is obtained by calling the interface function `interfaceAddr` with the arguments `_from` and `"AMP-TOKEN-SENDR"`. The `tokensToSend` method of this contract is then called, passing in all of its arguments. However, there is nothing in this function that would indicate that the values of `_operator`, `_to`, and `_value` are dependent on `_data`.
Similarly, in `_caPartitionStrategOperatorhHook`, the only reference to the partition variable appears to be in a conditional statement that checks if the prefix is a valid partition strategy. If the strategy is not valid, then the method returns without doing anything. Therefore, it is impossible for the data in any of these variables to affect the outcome of that conditional.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependent". Could you explain what that means in relation to this problem?
