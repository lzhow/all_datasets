Label: no

Reason: In the given Solidity code snippet, the contract state `_symbol` is initialized with the string literal `"n00d"` directly within the ERC777 constructor call and does not depend on the `defaultOperators` variable. The `defaultOperators` variable is used as an argument for the ERC777 constructor to set up the default operators for the token, but it does not influence the value of `_symbol`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_symbol` and `defaultOperators`.
