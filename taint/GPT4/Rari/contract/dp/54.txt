The variable `b` in the function `sub` is not data dependent on the variable `errorMessage` in the function `mul`. In Solidity, function parameters are scoped to their respective functions, meaning that the parameters are not accessible outside of the function they are defined in. The variable `b` in `sub` is used to perform a subtraction operation, and its value is independent of the `errorMessage` parameter in `mul`, which is used only to customize the error message in case of a multiplication overflow. There is no shared state or data flow between these two variables across the function boundaries in the given code.
