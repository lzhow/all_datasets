  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `rat` variable is calculated using the division of `numer` and `denominator` variables.
`numer = Exp(mintissa : liquidityIncetive)` and
 ` denominater =  Exp (maintissa  : pricecollaterl)`
  ` ratio= div_ (numer,denom)`  and  the  variable  seizetokn is calulated using  mul scalar truncate function.  The  first  argument  is `ration` which is dependent on `pricecollteral`
   and the second argument is actualrepayamount. Therefore, ` seiseTockens ` is data-dependent on  actual repay amount.
