Label: yes

Reason: The variable `spender` in the function `transferFrom` is used as an argument in the function `_spendAllowance`, which means it affects the behavior of that function. Since the function `_spendAllowance` is called before the function `_transfer`, and the function `_transfer` is called in the function `balanceOf`, the variable `spender` indirectly affects the behavior of the function `balanceOf`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the variable `spender` in the function `transferFrom` and the variable `_balances[account]` in the function `balanceOf`.
