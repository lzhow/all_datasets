The function is not compilable due to syntax errors.


 
I'm sorry, I made a mistake in my previous message. Here is a corrected version:

Here is an example Solidty function:

    function example(uint a, uint[2] memory arr) public pure returns(bool)
    {
        uint x = a + arr[0];
        return x > 10;
    }
    
Is the `x` variable in this function data-dependent on `a` and `arr[1]`?
 
  Yes, the x variable is data dependant on a and arr. This is because the value of x depends on both of these variables. If a or arr changes, then the new value for x will also change.
In this case, x is dependent on arr because it is being used to index into the array. However, it could also be dependent directly on variable a. For example, if a is multiplied by 2, and the result is added to arr, that could make x dependent indirectly on that as well. In this example the indirect dependency is ignored, but in other cases it may be important to consider.
  In general, data dependencies can be complex and
