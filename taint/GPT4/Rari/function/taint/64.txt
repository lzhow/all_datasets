Explanation: The variable `b` in the function `divUInt` is not controlled by the user. It is an input parameter of the function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. The function does not contain any code that allows the user to modify or control the value of `b` within the function. Therefore, the variable `b` is not controlled by the user.
