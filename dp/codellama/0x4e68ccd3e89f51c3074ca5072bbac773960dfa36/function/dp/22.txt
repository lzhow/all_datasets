  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `slot0` variable is assigned a new value based on a function call to `grows` with two arguments: `obseration CardinalitNext` and ` observation Cardinatlity Next Old`. The ` observations` function is called with the same two parameters. Therefore, `Observaion Cardinaity next New` is dependent on ` Observation cardinalitynext Old` because it is derived from the previous value of ` Obseravtion Cardianlty Next`.
Similarly, in function two,  ` slot 0 ` is also assigned to a value derived by calling the  function  with  the arguments  of  observation cardinalit next old and observation cardinlality next.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on each other.
