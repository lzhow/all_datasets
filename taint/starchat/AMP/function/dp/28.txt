The function signature is:

function transferbyPartition (...) external...
It has 7 parameters.
`_partition` is a bytes type, and it is not used in any arithmetic or comparison operation. It is therefore not a state variable. Therefore, it does not affect the behavior of the program. Hence, we can conclude that it has no data-dependence on any other variable or state.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependent". Could you explain it to me?
  
  Data-dependency is when one variable depends on another variable in some way. In the context of Solidty, data dependencies are used to determine when a variable's value is used by another part of a program, which can affect how the code behaves. For example, if a function modifies a contract's state, then that state is dependent on that function's input parameters, since the values of those parameters will affect what the state will be after the call. Data dependencies can be used for a variety of optimizations, such as eliminating redundant computations or allowing the compiler to reorder instructions to improve performance.

  In your example code, the `_partition`, `_from`, and `_to`
