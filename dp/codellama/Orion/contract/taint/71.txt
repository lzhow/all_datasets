  
No, the ` token` variable in function `safeAutoTokenET` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` safe AutoToken ET` function takes in a `address` type parameter `to` and a uint type `value` as input. It then checks if ` address (this)` is equal to ` to` before transferring the token or ETH. If ` this` address is different from `  to`, it will transfer the tokens or ethers to the recipients address.
