Not all differences are equal: some changes may have unintended consequences, or may even produce incorrect output in rare circumstances. In these cases, it's better to err on the side of caution and keep the original code unchanged. However, if you're confident that all the changes in the patch are correct and have no negative side effects, you can apply the entire patch.
