Explanation: The variable `deltaDrip_` in the function `drip` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the values of `dripRate_`, `dripStart_`, `dripped_`, `blockNumber_`, and `reservoirBalance_`. The user does not have direct control over these variables, as they are either predefined or derived from the contract's internal state. Therefore, the variable `deltaDrip_` is not controlled by the user.
