Then, depending on the comparison `if (array[mid] > element)`, the value of `high` can be updated to `mid`.

They are declared within the function bodies and their scopes are limited to those functions. There is no interaction or dependency between the two variables across the function boundaries in the given code snippet. Each function call operates on its own set of parameters and local variables, and there is no shared state or data flow between `a` and `c` as presented in the code."
