The variable `numTicks` in the function `tickSpacingToMaxLiquidityPerTick` is calculated based on the constants `TickMath.MIN_TICK`, `TickMath.MAX_TICK`, and the parameter `tickSpacing`. It is used to determine the maximum liquidity per tick based on the tick spacing.

On the other hand, the variable `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` in the function `getFeeGrowthInside` is a parameter that represents the global fee growth in token1 terms. It is used to calculate the fee growth inside a specific tick range.

There is no direct or indirect interaction between `numTicks` and `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` in the given code. They are used in separate functions for different purposes and do not share any state or influence each other's values. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
