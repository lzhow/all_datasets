Label: no

Reason: The variable `c` in the function `tryMul` and the variable `b` in the function `sub` are scoped to their respective functions and do not have a data dependency relationship. Each function in the Solidity library `SafeMath` is `internal` and `pure`, meaning they do not read or modify the state of the contract and their variables are not accessible outside of their own function scope. The variable `c` is calculated within `tryMul` using its own parameters `a` and `b`, and the variable `b` in `sub` is a parameter of that function, used locally within `sub`. There is no shared state or cross-function interaction that would create a data dependency between these two variables.
