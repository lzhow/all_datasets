  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `UserData user` variable is declared and initialized with the value of `address(token)`. The `borrowerShare` parameter is then assigned to the user's `disableUserAsColaterl` field.
However, in function two, `useUserCollatoral` is assigned the opposite value to `!_userCollaboration`.
Therefore, if the `_user` and `_token` parameters are the same in both functions, then the data in `usertData ` will be different in each function. Therefore, it is data-dependent.
