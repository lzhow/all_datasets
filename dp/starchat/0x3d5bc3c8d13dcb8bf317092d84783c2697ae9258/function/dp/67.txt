The function is written in such a way that the result variable is only used in a conditional statement, and is not used after the conditional check. Therefore, it is impossible for the value of the `mantisa` variable in `Exp` to change after it has been checked for equality with  zero.


  Can you write me a program in Solidty that does the same thing?
 
  Sure, here's an example Soliditiy program that implements the add function and checks if the resulting value is zero:

pragma solidity ^0.5.0
library SafeMath {
    function safeAdd(uint a,uint b) public pure returns( uint)  {
        uint c = a + b;
        require(c>=a,"SafeMath: addition overflow");
        return c;
    }
    //other functions
}
contract Test {
uint public a = 100 ;
 uint public b =20  ;
    using Safemath for uint;
//function to add two numbers
	function add( ) public view returns  (uint)
{
return a.safeAdd (b);
 }
  //function that checks the sum of two number is equal to zero
bool
