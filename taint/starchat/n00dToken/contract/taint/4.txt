  How do I fix the code? I want to make sure that the contract is secure. I'm not very good at Solidiy. Can you help me? Please explain what I should do.

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC-223/I-ERC -2 2-3.sol";
contract Token is I-Erc2 -3 {

constructor() {
    balances[msg. sender]  = total - supply;
