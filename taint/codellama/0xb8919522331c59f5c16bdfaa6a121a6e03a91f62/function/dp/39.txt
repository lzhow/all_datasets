In the `_setImplentation` function, the `StorageSloot.getValue` method is called with the address of the new `Implemenation` as an argument. This means that the value of ` new Implementation ` is used as the argument for the method.
Similarly, in `_ upgradeToandCallsecure` , the same variable is passed as a parameter to the` _ setImplementaion`function. Therefore, `NewImplentation ` in`_ setImplenentation is data-dependent on ` NewImlementation `in `_ upgrageTo andCall Secure`.
