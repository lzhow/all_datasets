   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to make my own programs.   There are many resources available to help you learn Python. Here are some of them:

1. Codecademy: This is an interactive website that offers a series of courses on Python programming. It has a gamified approach, where you earn points for completing exercises and completions.

2. FreeCodeCamp: Similar to CodeCademy, FreeCodecamp offers courses to teach you Python from scratch. They have a community forum where people can help each other out and offer support. 

3. Udemy: Udem has many courses available on various Python topics, including web development, data science, and machine learning. These courses are taught by experienced instructors and have great reviews.

These are just a few of the many options available. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's best to choose one that fits your learning style and goals. Good luck!
