no

In the provided Solidity constructor code, there is no mention of a variable or contract state named `_owner`. The constructor initializes several state variables with the values provided as arguments (`_baseBorrowRate`, `_rateSlope1`, `_rateSlope2`, `_collateralPercent`, `_liquidationBonusPercent`), but `_owner` is not one of them, nor is it affected by `_liquidationBonusPercent` within the scope of this code snippet. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `_owner` and `_liquidationBonusPercent` as per the given code.
