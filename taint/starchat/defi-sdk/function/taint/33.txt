  What is an example of a situation where a variable is unknown?

In computer programming, the term "control flow" is often used in reference to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls of an imperative program are executed. Control flow is determined by how the program's instructions are structured and organized.
Control flow can be further classified into two main categories:
1. Sequential: The statements in a program execute in sequential order, one after the other. This is sometimes referred to as top-down or procedural programming.

2. Selection: A program may choose to execute one of several alternative blocks of code, depending on certain conditions. These conditions are often based on user input or other factors. In this type of control flow, flow of execution jumps to one or more of the alternative code blocks based upon the evaluation of certain expressions. A common example is found in decision structures such as if-then-else statements. 

A variable's value can also be unknown at compile time. For example,
