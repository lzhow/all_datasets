Yes

The variable `_pair` in the function `setTokenPairMap` is data dependent on the variable `_asset` because `_pair` is used to update the mapping `tokenToPair` with `_asset` as the key. The line `tokenToPair[_asset] = _pair;` establishes a direct data dependency where the value of `_pair` is assigned to the mapping at the index specified by `_asset`. This means that the value of `_pair` is used to update the state of the contract in a way that is directly related to the value of `_asset`.
