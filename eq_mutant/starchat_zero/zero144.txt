The two provided codes in Java are **not** semanticlly equal, as they produce different outputs for the given input array. This happens due to different implementations of the bubble sort algorithm.

Regarding the C code, the situation is similar, but the output might be different as there could be some platform-specific implementation differences that result in different output. However, considering the simplicity of bubble sorting and the fact that the arrays are relatively small (not big, not too many elements), the difference in output should not matter much.
