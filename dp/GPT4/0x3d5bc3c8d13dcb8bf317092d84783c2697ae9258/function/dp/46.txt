Reason: The variable `simpleInterestFactor` in the function `accrueInterest` is calculated within that function using the `borrowRateMantissa` and `blockDelta`. It does not rely on any external state changes or variables that are modified by other functions. On the other hand, the variable `repayAmount` in the function `repayBorrowFresh` is specific to the context of a repayment transaction and is used to calculate the new borrower balance and total borrows after a repayment has occurred.

There is no direct data dependency between `simpleInterestFactor` and `repayAmount` because they are used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions. Changes to `repayAmount` do not affect the calculation of `simpleInterestFactor`, and vice versa. Each variable is derived from separate sources of input and does not influence the other.
