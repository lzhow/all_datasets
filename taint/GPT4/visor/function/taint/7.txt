Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `owner` in the function `allowance` is an input parameter provided by the caller of the function. Since the caller (user) specifies the address for the `owner` parameter when they call the `allowance` function, it is controlled by the user. The function `allowance` is designed to check the amount of tokens that an `owner` has allowed a `spender` to use on their behalf, and the `owner` address is supplied by the user querying this information.
