Label: no

Reason: The variable `_oracles` in the constructor function and the variable `underlyings` in the `add` function are parameters passed to these functions when they are called. Each function call operates with its own set of parameters, and the parameters of one function do not depend on the parameters of another function. The relationship between `_oracles` and `underlyings` within the same function call is established by the requirement that their lengths must be equal and the subsequent loop that iterates over them. However, this relationship does not extend across different function calls. Therefore, `_oracles` in the constructor is not data dependent on `underlyings` in the `add` function. Each function call is independent, and the state of the variables in one function does not influence the state of the variables in the other function.
