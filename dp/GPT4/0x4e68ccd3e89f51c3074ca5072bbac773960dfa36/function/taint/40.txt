Label: No

Reason: The variable `blockTimestamp` in the function `write` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter of the function, and its value is expected to be the timestamp of the current block when the function is called. In Ethereum, the `block.timestamp` (also known as `now` in older versions of Solidity) is determined by the miner and cannot be directly set by the user. However, miners have a limited ability to manipulate block timestamps, so while the user cannot directly control the `blockTimestamp`, they also cannot fully trust that it is accurate to the exact second. The Ethereum protocol enforces rules to keep the timestamp within certain bounds to prevent extreme manipulation.
