  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `drift` function, the local variable 'b' is assigned the value of the expression `sub(a, b)`. The `a` and ` b` variables are both passed as arguments to the internal ` sub` method, which is defined in a separate contract. Therefore, ` a` is data-dependent on ` c` because it is used as an argument to a method that modifies `  c`.
