  
No, the ` amount` variable in `getNext S qrt PriceFrom Amount0 Rounding Up` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` get Next S Qrt priceFrom amount  R ounding up` function takes in three parameters: `sqrt P X9 6`, `liqu idity`, and `amoun t`. The ` amoun  t` parameter is a user-supplied value that is used to calculate the next square root price. However, since it has a fixed name and is passed as an argument to the  function,  it cannot be controlled directly by a malicious user and therefore is considered not to be under the control of the attacker.
