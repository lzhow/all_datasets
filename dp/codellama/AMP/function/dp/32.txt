  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_trasnferbyPartion` function, the value of `_allowedbypartition` is used to determine if the transfer is allowed. This value is calculated based on `_from`, `_operator`, and `_to` variables.
On the other hand, in `_tranferDefaultBypartition`, the `defaultpartition ` variable is passed as an argument to `_ transferbypartion`.
Therefore, `_ value` variable in _trasnbferdefaultbyparition is data-dependent on _ value variable of _ transferBypartition.
