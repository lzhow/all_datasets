Reason: The variable `pair` in the function `pairFor` is used to determine the address of the liquidity pool for a given pair of tokens (`tokenA` and `tokenB`) using the `curFactory` address. It is calculated based on the addresses of the tokens and the factory address, and it does not depend on any other state variables or inputs from outside the function.

On the other hand, the variable `amountOut` in the function `_doSwapTokens` represents the amount of output tokens received after a swap operation. It is calculated within the function based on the amounts array, the swap path, and the balances of the tokens before and after the swap. It is dependent on the swap amounts, the path, and the current state of the liquidity pools, but not on the `pair` variable from the `pairFor` function.

Since `pair` is calculated independently of `amountOut`, and `amountOut` does not influence the calculation of `pair`, there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables.
