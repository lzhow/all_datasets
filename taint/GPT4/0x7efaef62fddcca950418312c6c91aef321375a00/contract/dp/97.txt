The variable `to` in the function `_safeTransfer` is data dependent on the variable `amount1` in the function `burn` because `amount1` determines the value that will be transferred to the address `to` within the `burn` function. Here's the flow of data dependency:

1. In the `burn` function, `amount1` is calculated based on the liquidity being burned and the current balance of `token1` in the contract.
2. The `burn` function then calls `_safeTransfer` with `to` and `amount1` as arguments to transfer `amount1` of `token1` to the address `to`.
3. The `_safeTransfer` function uses these arguments to perform the transfer operation.

Therefore, the value of `amount1` directly affects the execution of `_safeTransfer` when it is called within the `burn` function, establishing a data dependency relationship between `to` in `_safeTransfer` and `amount1` in `burn`.
