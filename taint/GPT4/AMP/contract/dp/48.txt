Yes

The variable `prefix` in the function `_callPartitionStrategyOperatorHook` is data dependent on the variable `_partition` in the same function. This is because `prefix` is directly derived from `_partition` using the function `PartitionUtils._getPartitionPrefix(_partition)`, which means that the value of `prefix` is determined by the value of `_partition`.
