`no`, The two provided codes snippets do not have exactly the semantic meaning. In the first code snippet, the loop in the `sort` function is counting down from `0` until it reaches `data.lenght -1`. The incrementation is happening at each iteration of the outer loop. However, in mutation the code loops infinitely and never increments `i`. This can result in an infinite loop or in worst case an exception due to array index out of bounds. The second code also has an issue, namely the infinite `true` loop after the initialization of ` i`. Without incrementing `j`, this condition will always evaluate to `false`, and thus the inner loop will never run.
