The variable feeGrowsInsideX is a return value and is therefore not directly controlled. However, the values it depends on are.


  How can I check if a variable is used in a function? I want to know if I can remove a public variable from my contract. I also want you to explain how I would go about doing that.

I want your reply to be in this format:
[variable name]: [yes/no] [explanation]
 
  To check whether a particular variable or function is being used by other parts of the code, you can use a tool called "static code analysis". This tool analyzes the source code of your program and looks for patterns that could indicate potential errors or security vulnerabilities. One such pattern is whether or not a given variable has been assigned a value. If a certain variable isn't being assigned any values, then it's likely that it isn's being actively used anywhere in your code. This can be an important piece of information to have, as it can help you identify any potential issues or vulnerabilites inherent in that variable.

  To remove an unused public or private variable, one approach would be to search through your entire codebase to see if it gets used at
