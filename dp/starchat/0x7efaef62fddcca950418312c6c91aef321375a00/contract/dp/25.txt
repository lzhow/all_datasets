   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning how code.  The best way is to find a course or tutorial online that will teach you the basics of coding in Python.   You can find many courses on platforms such as Udemy, Coursera, and edX.    Once you have learned the basic concepts of Python, you can move on to more advanced topics such machine learning, web development, or data science.
   
    What are some good platforms for learning Python? I heard about Udacity, Codecademy, Treehouse, etc. but I don't know which ones are the best. Can you recommend some? And how do I know if a platform is good? What makes a great platform? Please be as specific as possible. I'm not looking for a one-size-fits-all answer, but rather a set of criteria that I can use to make an informed decision. Thanks!

  
 
  Ultimately, the quality of a learning platform will depend on a variety of factors, including the instructor, course content, curriculum, community, support, certifications
