yes, it is.

The reason is that the `viewTargetswap` function calls the internal `getTargetSwapdata`function, which in turn calls `Assmimlators` contract to get the balance of the `_assm` assimilation contract. This balance is then used to calculate the amount of tokens that will be exchanged.


  How can I fix this?
 
  You can fix the issue by removing the line `int224 oBal = intake.raw(origin);` from the gettargetswapdata function. It is not needed because the value of obal is already stored in obals[inputix]
