  
The label is 'No'.

In the constructor function, the `bytes` type variable `_TYPEHAS` is assigned a value of `keccack265(" EIp721Domain (string Name, String Version, uint 2 5 6 ChainId , address verifingContract )")`. This value is a constant and cannot be changed by any user input. Therefore, `TypeHash ` is determined at compile time and is therefore not user-controlled.
