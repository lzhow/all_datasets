  
No, the variables ` value` and ` data` are independent.

The function  ` decode I3 2` is a function that takes a `Data` object as an argument and returns an `int 4` value, while the ` Data` argument is passed by value and is not modified by the called function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
