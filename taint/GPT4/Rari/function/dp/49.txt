The variable `seizeError` in the function `liquidateBorrowFresh` is data dependent on the variable `borrower` in the function `seizeInternal`. 

Reason: The value of `seizeError` is determined by the return value of the `seizeInternal` function, which in turn depends on the value of the `borrower` variable. Therefore, there is a data dependency between these two variables.
