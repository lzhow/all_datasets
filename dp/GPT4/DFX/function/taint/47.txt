Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `_quoteCurrency` in the function `newCurve` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function, but there is no indication in the code provided that the value of `_quoteCurrency` is influenced or controlled by the user. Therefore, the label is unknown.
