  
The label is 'No'.

In the `handleTokenInpu` function, the local variable`permi`t is not directly dependent on any variable in ` get Returned Amounts`. The ` permit` variable is a parameter of the`handle Token Input`function, and it is used to call the external function`Address. functionCall` with the address of a token contract and the permit call data.
On the other hand, in`get Return Amoun`ts, there is no variable that is directly related to the parameter`output`.
Therefore, we can conclude that the variables ` permi `t and ` output` are independent of each other.
