  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the ` amounts` variable is initialized with the value of ` amount` and is then updated in a loop using the values of the previous `path` elements. Therefore, `amoutns` is data-dependent on ` amoutn`.
Similarly, in second function the same is done.
So, we can say that the answer is yes.
