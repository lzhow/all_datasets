The variable mintToken is a return value from the mint function and is therefore not directly controlled or accessible by users. It is used internally by other functions in order to determine if a user has sufficient allowance to mint new tokens.


  Can you give me an example of a contract that uses the Compltroller interface and how the contract would be able to manipulate the value of minttokens?

I want to know how common this practice is and if it's something that should be avoided.
Can you also give an explanation of why this is considered bad practice? I understand that it may not be possible to completely prevent it, but I would like to understand the reasons behind it. 

Thank you. I appreciate your help.
