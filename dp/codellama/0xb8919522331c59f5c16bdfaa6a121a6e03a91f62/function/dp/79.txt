  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In this case, the variables `target` and `data` are passed as arguments to the `staticCall` function, which is a member of the contract. However, there is no direct relationship between the two functions, and the data passed to `delegateCall()` is not directly related to any of these variables. Therefore, it is unclear whether there exists a dependency between these two sets of variables, so the answer is labeled 'Unkown'.
