No, the variable `amountLeft` in the function `_grantComp` is not data dependent on the variable `numTokens` in the function `_setCompSpeeds`. 

The reason is that there is no direct assignment or usage of `numTokens` in the calculation or assignment of `amountLeft` in the `_grantComp` function. The value of `amountLeft` is determined solely based on the result of the `grantCompInternal` function and the condition `amountLeft == 0`. There is no interaction or dependency between these two variables.
