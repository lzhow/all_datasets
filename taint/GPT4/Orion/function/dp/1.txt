Explanation: 

Based on the given code, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `balances` in the function `get_xp` and the variable `factory` in the function `getAmountsIn`. The two variables are used in separate functions and there is no direct assignment or usage of one variable in relation to the other. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between them without further information about the code logic or any potential indirect dependencies.
