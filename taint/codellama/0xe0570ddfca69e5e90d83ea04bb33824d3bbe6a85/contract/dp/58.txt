  
No, the variables `_ withdraw` and ` amount` are independent.

The variable  `_ withdrawn` is defined in function  `withDraw` as the amount of tokens to be with drawn from a vaule. This variable is dependent on  the balance of the vaut and the total supply of shares.  The variable amount is also defined as a parameter in  function`inCasetokengetStuk` . This function transfers the tokens from  a contract to a user. However, this function does not affect the value of `_  withdraw`. Therefore, `_ Withdraw ` and  amount are  independent variables.
