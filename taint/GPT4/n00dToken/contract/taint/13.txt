Label: no

Reason: The variable `_ERC1820_REGISTRY` is declared as a constant within the `ERC777` contract and is initialized with a specific address (`0x1820a4B7618BdE71Dce8cdc73aAB6C95905faD24`) which represents the ERC1820 Registry contract address. This address is hardcoded into the contract and cannot be changed by any user or external interaction after the contract has been deployed. It is not a state variable that can be modified, but rather a constant value that is set at the time of contract creation and remains the same throughout the contract's lifecycle. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
