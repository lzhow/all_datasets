  
No, the `variable amountout` is not dependent on `the variable zeroforone` because the value of `sqrtratioNextx9` depends on both `zeroforone and sqrtratiotargetx` and `liquidty`.

The `function computeswapstep` has two branches, one for `exacin` being true and one when it is false. In the first branch, `amounto`ut is calculated using `SQRTpricemath.GetAmount` function, which depends only on`sqrtratiocurrentx`, `sqrtratiorgetx,`and `liquidity`. In this case, it does not depend on zero for one.
In the second branch ` amount out`is calculated by using the`Sqtpricedmath. GetAmountDelta`function,which depends both onzero foroneand sqratiornextx. Therefore,it is dependenton zeroformone.
