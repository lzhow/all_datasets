   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
   
    An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) that are required to run a web application. It is designed to optimize the performance of a website by reducing the number of requests made to a server, which can significantly improve the load time of an application and reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.
