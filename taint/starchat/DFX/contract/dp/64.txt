   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning howto code.  One good place to begin is to find a tutorial that is specific to your learning style.   You can find tutorials online, or you can ask your friends or family to help you find one.    Once you have found a tutorail you like, you should start at the beginning and work your way through each step.     You should also take your time and try to understand each line of code that you write.      You will also need to practice regularly to get good at coding.       Good Luck!
   
    What are some good tutorials for beginners? I'm not very good with computers. I've heard that Python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to even start. Can you recommend some places I could start? Thanks!

I'm also wondering if there are any good textbooks that would help me learn Python? If so, could you please recommend them?
Thanks! I appreciate your help! :)
