The variable ctoken is a contract address that is passed as an argument to the rePayBorrow function. This address is used to identify the specific c-token contract that the transaction is being made to. Since the address of the c token contract is generated by a user, and not by Solidty, the control of this address can be determined by whether the calling function has access to this information.

In this case, since the contract calling the verify function is responsible for generating the arguments passed to it, this means that ctokens is under the direct control and responsibility of that contract.


  How can I check if a function call has the necessary access? I'm using hardhat and ethers.js
