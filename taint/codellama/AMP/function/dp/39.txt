Explanation:
In the given function, the `if` statement checks if the value of `_indexOfTotalsupply` is zero. If it is, then the `_totalPartions` array is updated with the new partition.
`totalSupllybyPartion` depends on `_valu` because it adds the amount of tokens to the total supply of the partition, which is determined by the input `_val`ue.
