The contract does not have any state variables named `ticksLower`.

However, the `modifyposition` function does have an argument named "ticklower", which is used to modify the position's `lower` tick.

  I am sorry, you are right. I made a mistake. It is not possible for the "liquidity" variable to be data dependant on "tickslower" in this contract. Thank you for your help. Is there anything else I can help you with?
