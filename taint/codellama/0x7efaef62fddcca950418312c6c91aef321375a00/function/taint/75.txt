  
No, the `_ reserver1 ` variable in function `_ mintF` is uncontrolled by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and is only accessible within that function. It is created and initialized when the `getReserve` function is called, and it does not have any user input or interaction. Therefore, this variable is considered uncontrollable by users.
