The variable `_ideal` in the function `calculateFee` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `_ideal` is calculated based on the input parameters `_gLiq` and `_weights`, which are not controlled by the user. Therefore, the variable `_ideal` is not directly influenced or controlled by the user.
