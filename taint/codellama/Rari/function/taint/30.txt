  
The variable 'b' in function 'sub' is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the value of 'a' (the first argument of the 'mul' function) is calculated using the multiplication of two variables, 'driftRate'  and  'blockNumber - driftStart'. The value 'driftRate ' is a public variable that is set by a user, but the other variable,  block number, is determined by blockchain. Therefore, the calculation of  the  value  of a is partially controlled  by  a  user and partially by external factors.
Similarly, in  function  add, variable  c is also partially  controlled   by user  input and external  factors, as it  is   calculated  using  addition  operation.  Therefore  it   is    labled  as  unknown.
