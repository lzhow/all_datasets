  
No, the `StrategicCandiate` contract is data-dependent on `_implementaion` because it is used to store the address of the new strategy implementation. However, this does not mean that the state of `StrategyCadidate ` is dependent on ` _implemenation`. The state is only dependent if the value of `_implmentation` is changed.

The reason for the above conclusion is that ` StrategyCadeidte` has a `implementation ` field that stores the `_ implementation` value. This means that if `_ implemnetation ` changes, then the field ` implementation ` will also change. Therefore, ` strategyCandeidt` will be data dependend on` _ implementation`.
However, if ` strateyCanteid` doesnot change, it will not be dependent of`_ implementation `.
It is important to note that this analysis is based on a specific implementation of a contract and may not apply to other implementations.
