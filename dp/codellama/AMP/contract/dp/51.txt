  
No, the variables `_operater` and `_partition` are independent.

The variable`_prefix `in the ` setpartitionStrategy` function represents the prefix of the partition, which is used to identify the type of partition. It is not directly related to the `_ operator` variable in any way.  The `_ prefix` is only used in a few places in ` _setpartitionstrateg` to check if the given partition prefix is already in use or not. However, it does not affect the value of `_ operater`.
