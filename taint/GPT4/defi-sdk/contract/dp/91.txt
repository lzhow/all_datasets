Label: no

Reason: The variable `swapType` in the function `callBytes` is used to determine which function to call between `getAmountsOut` and `getAmountsIn` based on whether the swap is for fixed inputs or fixed outputs. Once the decision is made and `getAmountsIn` is called, the variable `i` within that function is used as a loop index to iterate over the pairs and calculate the amounts in for each step of the swap. The value of `i` is independent of the value of `swapType`; it is solely used for iteration within the `getAmountsIn` function and does not influence or depend on the `swapType` variable. The data dependency would imply that the value of one variable is directly influenced by or derived from the other, which is not the case here.
