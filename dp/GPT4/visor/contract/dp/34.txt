The variable `high` in the function `findUpperBound` is data dependent on the variable `array` because its initial value is set to `array.length`. The `high` variable is used to determine the upper bound of the search space within the `array` when performing a binary search to find the upper bound of the `element`. The loop condition and the subsequent adjustments to the `high` variable are also based on comparisons with values from the `array`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `high` and `array`.
