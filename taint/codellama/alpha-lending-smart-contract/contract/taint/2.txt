  
No, the `_users` variable in function `accumulateAlphatoUser` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function takes in a user address as a parameter, and the address is passed in by a different user who is calling the contract. Therefore, this variable is under the control of the calling user and not under their control.
