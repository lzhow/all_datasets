   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but has no prior experience. Could you recommend a few beginner friendly python coding resources? I would also appreciate it if you could explain what python code does. For example, in this code:

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
c = list(a)
print(b)  # prints [2] because b points to the same list as a.
 print(id(1)) #prints 448896
 a[0] = 'hello'
 #print (a[1]) # this would cause an error because the list is now ['hello', 2,3].
#print b[2])  this also would because a and b are now pointing to different lists.  What would be the best way for me to keep track of all the variables in
