The contract variable _total supply is not dependent on variable  `_ from`  in function  ` swap` . The variable is only used to calculate the amount of tokens to be transferred from the sender's account to the recipient' s account. It is also used in a require statement to ensure that the transfer is successful. However, the total supply of the token is a separate variable that is maintained by the smart contract and is unrelated to either the `_ totalSuppy` or `_ amount` variables. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
