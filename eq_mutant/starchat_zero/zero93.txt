Yes, these two programs are essentially semantic equivalent, as their functionality is to sort an array of integers in ascending order using the quick sort algorithm. However, the second program has a subtle bug in the swap() method, which incorrectly swaps the elements at indices first and first+last-2 instead of first two elements. This bug results in a sorting error when the input array contains duplicate elements, since the algorithm will put all the duplicate occurrences of the first element in one sub-array, and all of its occurrences in another subarray. The bug only occurs when first is greater than or equal to last-1. Therefore, while the sorting result for an input with no duplicates is correct, it will produce the wrong result when duplicates are present.
