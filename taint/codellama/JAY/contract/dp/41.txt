  
No, the ` amount` variable in ` buy Jay With ER C1 5 6` is not dependent on ` amounts` from ` bu yJ ayWith ER c1` .

The ` amoun t` variab le is defined as a local variable within the scope of the` buy Jay With E R C 7 3 4` function, and it is assigned a value based on a loop that iterates over the elements of an array. This means that the value of `amoun` t is determined by the values of other variables in its scope, but it does not depend on any specific value in an external array, such as `a moun ts` , which is a parameter of another function.
Therefore, ` a mount` and `ams` are independent variables.
