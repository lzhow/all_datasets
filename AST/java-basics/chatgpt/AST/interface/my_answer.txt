The AST in JSON format for the given Java class file is as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "interface_declaration",
  "value": "Animal",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "method_declaration",
      "value": "a",
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "type": "method_declaration",
      "value": "r",
      "children": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The root node represents the interface declaration with the name "Animal".
- The interface declaration has two method declarations as its children.
- Each method declaration node has a "type" attribute set to "method_declaration" and a "value" attribute representing the method name.
- Since the methods do not have any parameters or body, their "children" arrays are empty.
