In the given code, the `liquidateCalcualteSeizetokents` function is a public view function that takes in three parameters: `address` `ctokenBorrowe`, `addres`s `CTokenCollatoral`, and `uint` repaYAmount. This function does not modify any state variables, and it doesnot take any input parameters. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the state variable ctokenCollteral is user-controlled or not.
