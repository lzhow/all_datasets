Label: no

Reason: The contract state `_status` is not present in the provided Solidity contract code. The function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmountExternal` does not reference any state or variable named `_status`. Additionally, the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmountExternal` is an external view function, which suggests it only reads data and does not write or update any state variables. Since `_status` is not mentioned or used within the scope of the function or anywhere else in the provided code, there is no data dependency relationship between `_status` and the variable `_token` within the context of the `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmountExternal` function.
