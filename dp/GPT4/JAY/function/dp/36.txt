The contract state `buyNftFeeJay` is not data dependent on the variable `erc721TokenAddress` in the function `buyNFTs`. 

Reason: The variable `erc721TokenAddress` is used as an input parameter for the function `buyNFTs`, but it is not directly used to modify or affect the value of the contract state `buyNftFeeJay`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two.
