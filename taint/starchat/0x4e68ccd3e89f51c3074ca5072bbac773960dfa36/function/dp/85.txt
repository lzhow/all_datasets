The variable "info" in function "update" is data-dependent on "maxliqudity" because the value of "liquidityGrosAfter" depends on it.


  Can you explain why?
 
  Sure! The "require" statement in line 13 of the code checks that the sum of liquidiyGroosBefore and liqUIDITYDelta is less than or equal to maxliqiudity. If this condition is not met, the program will revert and throw an error. This means that if the condition in "line 20" were to be true, then the "if" block in lines 30-33 would be executed, which would update the values of several variables in info, including liquiDITYGROSSAfter. Therefore, it is possible that "Line 40", which updates the liqiDityNet variable, would reference an outdated value for liquiditygross.

In conclusion, since the require statement checks the validity of a condition, and the if block updates info based on that condition (which could potentially change the outcome of that check), it's possible for the info variable to become outdated after the check
