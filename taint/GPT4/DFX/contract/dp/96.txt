Yes

The variable `_outputIx` in the function `viewTargetSwapData` is data dependent on the variable `_length` because `_length` is used to define the size of the arrays `nBals_` and `oBals_`, which are indexed using `_outputIx`. The relationship is established through the loop that iterates over the range defined by `_length`, and within this loop, the arrays `nBals_` and `oBals_` are accessed at the index `_outputIx`. The value of `_length` determines the valid range of indices for these arrays, and thus, it influences how `_outputIx` is used within the function. If `_length` were different, it could potentially change the behavior of the code that uses `_outputIx` to access array elements, leading to a data dependency between these two variables.
