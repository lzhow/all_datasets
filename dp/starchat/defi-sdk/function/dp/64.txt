yes, the owner_ state is data-dependent on destination.

The reason is that the call to `IUnivswapV1Pair.swap` is conditional on `next < lenght`, which depends on whether the loop has already completed. If the destination is not set to the `msg.send` address in this case, then the swap will fail.


  Can you explain why this is a problem?
 
  The reason this contract is vulnerable is because the code in question is written in such a way that it is possible for the value of `destionation` to be set incorrectly, which could result in a failed swap. This could potentially result, for example, in an attacker being able to steal all of the user's tokens by setting `output_token` and `input_tokem` both to their own address. Additionally, this could also result from a bug in which the conditional statement is set up incorrectly. For example:
 ```
   function foo(uint x) public {
       if(x > 5)
           address a = msgSender();
       else
           a == address_zero;
       a.call{value: 2 ether}("");
   }
}
