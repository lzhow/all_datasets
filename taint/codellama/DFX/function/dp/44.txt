Explanation:
In the first function, the `_length` variable is assigned the value of ` curve . assets . length` , which is a property of the `Curves` struct. This means that the length of `_assets` array is dependent on ` Curves ` struct, and therefore, `_ liquidity ` variable in first ` view Liquidty ` function is data-dependent on variable  ` curver ` in second ` View Liqidy `function.
