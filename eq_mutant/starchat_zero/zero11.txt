The two provided codes snippets are _not_ semantic equivalent because they contain different logic bugs. The first code snippet contains a bug in the while loop that skips one increment of the `upper` variable. As a result, the code does not correctly handle the case where the pivot value is equal to one of array elements.

In contrast, in this second code, one can see that the bug was fixed by incrementing `lower` and `bound` variables only in certain conditions.
