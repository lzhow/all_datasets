  
No, the variables `_ prefix` and `_ tokenHolder ` are independent in this code.

The variable` _ prefix ` is defined in function `setPartitonStrategy` as a parameter of the same name, and it is not modified or used in any way in that function. It is only used as an argument to the `PartionUtils` function`_getParitionStratgyValidatorIName`, which is called within the body of ` setParititonstrategy`.
On the other hand, variable ` _ tokenholder ` in `_ isoperator` is a local variable that is used to store the value of a function argument. However, it does not depend on any other variable in `isoperator`. It does depend, however, on a variable called `_operator`, but this variable is also a separate local parameter in`is operator`. Therefore, `_tokeholder` doesnot depend directly on `_ operator` or any of its other variables.
