The variable "target" in function "functionStaticcall" is a user-controlled variable. It is used to specify the contract address to call and is provided by a malicious user as input to the smart contract.


  How do I prevent this? Is there a way to make sure that the target variable is always sanitized before being used? Can you give me an example of how to do this in Solidty? I am a beginner so please provide code examples in multiple languages if that is easier. I want to learn how this is done correctly. Thank you.

I want you to explain this to me in a simple way. If you could also provide me with a list of other common vulnerabilities that I could prevent by knowing how Solidit works, that would be great. 

Please also include a section on how I can use tools to automatically detect and prevent these vulnerabilites. This would help me and other developers a lot. For example, how can I use a tool like Mythril to detect these issues? How can it be integrated into my continuous integration pipeline? Please provide detailed instructions for all steps. Thanks a ton!
