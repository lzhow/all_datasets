  
The variable 'error message' in function 'add' is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the ' error message ' variable is passed as an argument to the require function, which is a built-in function in Solidiy. It is used to check if a condition is met, and if not, an error is thrown. However, the error thrown by require is an internal error, not an external error. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the value of the ` errormessage ` variable comes from the outside or is generated internally.
