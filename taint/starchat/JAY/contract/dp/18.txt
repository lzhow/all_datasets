yes, it is.

The reason is that the assignment to `_sellNFTFee` is dependent on a value that is not available in its own scope. Specifically, the value of `USDPriceSell` which is declared outside of the scope of `_price`.
In order to calculate the correct value for `_SellNFTfee` the program needs to know the current value `of USDPricesell`. However, since the `_updateFee()` function is called in a separate scope, this value is unavailable to the inner scope and the calculation will always result in an unknown value, which will be assigned to `sellNFtFee`.


  Can you explain why this is a problem?
 
  Yes, of course!
Data dependency analysis is an important step in ensuring that smart contracts are secure and reliable. When two or more variables in code have dependencies on each other, there is potential for unintended consequences or security vulnerabilities. For example, if one variable is updated based on another, but the update is only partially complete, then the result can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous. This is because the updated value may not be consistent with the rest of program state, leading to potential security risks or other unwanted
