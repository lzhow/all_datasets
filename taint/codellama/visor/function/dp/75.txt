In the ` functionfunctionCall` function, the` data` variable is passed as an argument to the internal ` _functioncallWithvalue`function. However, this function does not modify the value of the data variable. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the state of `data` in `funcionDelegatecall` is dependent on ` data`.
