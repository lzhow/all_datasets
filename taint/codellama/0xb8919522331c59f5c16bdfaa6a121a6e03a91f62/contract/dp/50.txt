  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `Address` library, the `_verifyDelegateResult` function calls the target contract's `delegateCall` method with the provided `bytes` data. This means that the data in `retdata`, which is passed as an argument to the method, is dependent on `address` and `amount`, both of which are passed to `sendValue` as arguments. Therefore, `Data` is data-dependent on both `Target`and `Amount`.
