  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `if` statement checks if the asset address is equal to the zero address. If it is, then the result is set to `amout`. Otherwise (i.e., if it's not equal), the decmial value is calculated using the amount and the number of decmals of the token.
Since the calculation of `decimalValue` depends on `assetAdress` and `decmials`, `resut` is data-dependent on both `ammount`and `dcmicals`.
Similarly, in second function the same logic is applied. So, `reuslt`is data depend on`ammout` as well as `dcimial`
