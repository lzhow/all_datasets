yes, the `_I` variable in `get _y` is user controlled.

  What is a good way to mitigate this?  I want to make my tool as useful as possible.  How can I do that?

I want my users to use my tools, but I also want them to understand the limitations of my analysis.
Can you give me some examples of how to write my code so that it will be more difficult for users
to abuse my capabilities? I don't want users using my software to steal cryptocurrencies,
but I still want the tool to be useful. How do I make it so? Can you provide some
examples of code that will not be detected by my analyzer? Please provide examples
in Solidiity and JavaScript. I am particularly interested in how I can make sure
that my Solidty code will work correctly, and that my JavaScript code does not
contain any obvious errors. Can I use libraries in Soliditty to help me with this, or
do I have to do it all myself? If I need to implement something myself, can you
provide me a list of what I should implement, along with a description of the
implementation, so I know
