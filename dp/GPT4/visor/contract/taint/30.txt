Label: No

Reason: The variable `amount` in the `mint` function is not directly controlled by the user because the `mint` function is modified with the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that only the account that is currently set as the `owner` of the contract can call the `mint` function and specify the `amount` to mint. Since the `owner` is typically the deployer of the contract or an account designated by the deployer, and not any arbitrary user, the `amount` variable in this context is not user-controlled.
