The variable swapdata is a struct that is passed to the doSwaptThroughorionpool function. It contains information about the swap that needs to be performed, including the tokens being swapped, the amounts being spent and received, and the path the two tokens take through the Orin multi-pool.

As a code analysis and classification tool, my job is to determine if any of the variables in a smart contract are user-controlled. In this case, we can determine that the struct swap data is user controlled if it's passed into the contract by a user and if that user has the ability to modify the values in that struct. If the data in swap Data is modified by any user in any way, then the behavior of this function could be influenced by that modification.


  Can you explain how I can check if a variable is being passed in by user input?  I know how to do it in C++ but I don't know the syntax for Solidty
