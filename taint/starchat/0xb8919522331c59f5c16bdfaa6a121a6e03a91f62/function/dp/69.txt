The function upgradeTo() in TransparencyUpgradebleProxy.sol is a function that sets the implementation address of the proxy contract to a new address. This function is called by the owner of a proxy to upgrade the contract it is managing.

In the getImplementation() function, the address() keyword is used to retrieve the current implementation of an upgradeable proxy, which is stored in a state variable called _implementation. Then, we use the.call() method to call the staticcall function of that implementation contract, passing in an encoded function selector for the _getImplementation function. We then use require() to ensure that the call was successful, and use abi to decode the returned data. Finally, this function returns the retrieved implementation.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship." Could you please explain what that means?





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies.
