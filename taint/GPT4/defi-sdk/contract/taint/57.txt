Label: No

Reason: The variable `allowance` in the function `safeApproveMax` is not directly controlled by the user. It is determined by the current allowance set on the ERC20 token contract for the `spender` by the smart contract itself (`address(this)`). The allowance is retrieved by calling `IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), spender)`, which checks the amount the `spender` is currently allowed to spend from the smart contract's balance of the `token`. This value is set by previous approve transactions and can only be modified through the `approve` function of the ERC20 token, which is called by the contract, not directly by the user. The user can influence this value indirectly by interacting with the contract in ways that lead to the contract calling `approve`, but the `allowance` variable itself is not directly user-controlled within the context of the `safeApproveMax` function.
