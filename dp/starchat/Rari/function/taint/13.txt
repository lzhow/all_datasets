   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to move into a career in software development.
  
   The best way is to start with the basics and move on to more advanced topics. Start with learning the syntax of the language. Learn about variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, classes, etc. Once you have a solid understanding of these fundamental concepts, move to learning frameworks and libraries. Frameworks provide a set of tools and best practices that help you build applications faster and more efficiently. Some popular frameworks include Django, Flask, and React. Libraries are collections of pre-built code that you can use to build your application. Popular libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NLTK, Gensim, spaCy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, PyAutoGUI, PyQt5, wxPython, Kivy, Streamlit, FastAPI, Bottle, Falcon, Riot.js, React, Vue.JS, Angular, Ember, Meteor, Electron, Three.Js, D3.
