Label: no

Reason: In the given Solidity library `LowGasSafeMath`, the functions `add` and `sub` are both pure functions. This means that their return values are determined solely by their input values and they do not read or modify the state of the contract. Each function has its own local variables `x` and `y`, which are scoped to the function itself. The variable `x` in the `add` function is independent of the variable `y` in the `sub` function because they are local to their respective functions and there is no shared state or data passed between them. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `x` in `add` and `y` in `sub`.
