Explanation: The variable `a` in the function `tryDiv` is data dependent on the variable `a` in the function `div`. This is because both variables have the same name and type, and they are used in the same context of performing division operations. Therefore, any changes to the value of `a` in the function `div` will affect the value of `a` in the function `tryDiv`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
