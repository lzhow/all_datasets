Label: no

Explanation: The variable `_threshold` in the function `calculateMicroFee` is not data dependent on the variable `_nGLiq` in the function `calculateLiquidityMembrane`. The variable `_threshold` is calculated based on the variables `_ideal` and `_beta` in the `calculateMicroFee` function, and it does not use or reference the variable `_nGLiq` from the `calculateLiquidityMembrane` function. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
