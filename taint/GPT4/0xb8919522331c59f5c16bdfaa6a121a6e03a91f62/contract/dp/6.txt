Label: no

Reason: The variable `account` in the function `isContract` and the variable `target` in the function `functionCallWithValue` are function parameters that are independent of each other. Each function has its own scope, and the parameters are passed in by the caller of the function. There is no code within the provided Solidity contract that establishes a data dependency between `account` and `target`. They are used in different contexts within their respective functions and do not share state or influence each other's values.
