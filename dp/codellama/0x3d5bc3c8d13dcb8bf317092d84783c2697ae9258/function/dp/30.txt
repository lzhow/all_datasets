  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `function balanceofUnderlyng`, the expression `accountTokes[ownder]` is a function call that returns a value. This value is then passed as an argument to the internal function`mulScalerTruncat`e, which returns another value that is stored in `exchange rate`. The variable`exchange Rate` is not directly dependent on `BorrowSnapshot`, but it is indirectly dependent because it depends on a variable called `exchangRatecurrent`, which is also not dependent directly on`BorrrowSnapShot`.
On the other hand, the`borrrowIndex` variable in`function borroweBalancestoredinternal`is directly dependant onthe`accountBornows`variable, because the value of`accounBrownows[accout]`is used to calculate the index.
Therefore, `Balanace` and ` BorrwoSnapshot `are data-dependent.
