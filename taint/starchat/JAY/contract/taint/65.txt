  How do I fix the code? I am a beginner





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most user friendly syntax compared to other languages, but I don't know much about it.  Is there a way I can quickly learn the basics of python and start using it for data analysis?   I currently use excel for most of my work, and I would like to know if there is something similar to an "easy" or "fast" way of doing things in excel that I could do in Python.   Please let me know what you think.    Thank you.
