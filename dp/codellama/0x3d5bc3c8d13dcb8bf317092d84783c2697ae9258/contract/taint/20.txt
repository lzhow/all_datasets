  
The variable `redeemedTokes` in function ` redemAllow` is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user who calls the `enterMarkts` function.

In the code, the contract has a function called ` enter Markets` that takes an array of addresses as an argument. This function allows users to enter the markets by calling the smart contract.  The function then returns an uint array that contains the number of tokens that the users have entered the market. In this case, `redemedtokens` can directly be influenced by users who call the` enter markts ` function, making it controlled.
