Here's my analysis of the provided C and Java code snippets:

1. Both snippets are valid and compile correctly.
2. They both produce the correct output when compiled and executed. 
3. The C code uses logical operators in a way that is different from the Java one. Specifically, the C version uses the ternary operator in the leap-year calculation, while the corresponding line in Java uses an arithmetic operation. Other than that, both versions use the modulo operator to check for divisibility, and both sets of code use nested switch statements to calculate the day of year. So, aside from these small differences, they do have exactly the identical behavior for the given input, meaning that both are "semantically equivalent." 

In conclusion, yes, these two snippets of C/Java code are functionally and semanticallly equivalent, in that the output they produce for a given set of input is identical.
