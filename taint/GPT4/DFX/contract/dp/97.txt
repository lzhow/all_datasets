Label: no

Reason: The variable `curves_` in the function `proportionalDeposit` is calculated based on the variables within its own function scope, such as `__deposit`, `_oGLiq`, and `curve.totalSupply`. It is not directly influenced by the variable `_oBals` in the function `proportionalWithdraw`. The variable `_oBals` in `proportionalWithdraw` is used to calculate the amounts for withdrawals and is independent of the deposits calculation in `proportionalDeposit`. There is no shared state or computation that would create a data dependency between `curves_` in `proportionalDeposit` and `_oBals` in `proportionalWithdraw`. Each function operates on its own set of local variables and parameters, and the computations within one function do not affect the computations within the other.
