In the `initialize` function, the `_reserver1 ` variable is assigned the value of the input parameter `_ token 1`. This assignment does not depend on any other variable, so it is not a dependency.
On the other hand, in `_ update`, the` _ reservoir1 _` variable depends on ` _ reserve  _`, which is a local variable in`_ update`. Therefore, it depends.
