  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `pairForCure` function, the value of `pool` is determined by calling the method `findPoolForCoins` on an instance of the interface `ICurvRegistry`. This method takes three arguments: `factory`, `coina`, and `cob`. The value returned by this method is assigned to the local variable pool.
  In the`getAmoutOutCuver` method, there is a call to `xp[i]` and`xp [j]`. These variables are also defined in ` getAmounOut` and are used to calculate the return value.  The `i` variable is defined as `int(I) CurveRegisty (factory) .getCoinIndices (pool , from  , to) [0]` in` get AmountOut`.  This means that the values of`i`,`j`,and`pool `are all determined in a single call. Therefore, ` token A`is data-dependent on ` A`.
