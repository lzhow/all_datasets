Reason: The contract state `_indexOfPartitionsOf` is a mapping that keeps track of the index of a specific partition in the `_partitionsOf` array for a given address. It is used to manage the list of partitions that a token holder has tokens in. On the other hand, the variable `_value` in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` represents the amount of tokens being transferred.

The function `_callPreTransferHooks` is called during a token transfer operation to execute any additional logic that needs to occur before the transfer is completed, such as calling token sender hooks or partition strategy validators. However, this function does not directly modify the `_indexOfPartitionsOf` state. The `_value` variable is used to check conditions and call external contracts, but it does not influence the index mapping `_indexOfPartitionsOf`.

Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between `_indexOfPartitionsOf` and `_value` within the `_callPreTransferHooks` function, as `_indexOfPartitionsOf` is not altered based on the value of `_value` in this context.
