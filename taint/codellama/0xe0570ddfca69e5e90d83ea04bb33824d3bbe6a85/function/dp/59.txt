The contract variable ` stratCandiate` is not dependent on `_ pool` because it is defined in a different function. In the ` deposite` function, the `_ amount` variable is used to calculate the number of shares to be minted, but the value of ` strateCadidate ` is never used. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
