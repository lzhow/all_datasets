Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `decimals` is set within the constructor of the `vVISR` contract. The value for `decimals` is passed as an argument to the constructor when the contract is deployed. The person or entity that deploys the contract (the deployer) is considered a user in this context, and they have control over what value is passed for `decimals` during deployment. Therefore, the initial value of `decimals` is controlled by the user.
