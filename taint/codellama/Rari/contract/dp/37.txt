  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `drift` function, the value of `driptotal_`, which is calculated using the multiplication of the current block number and the dribble rate, is assigned to the local variable to `Dript_`. The value is then subtracted from the total drips already dript, which are stored in ` drippd_ `, and assigned the result to a new local varible `delta Drip _`.
Then, `min` is called to determine the minimum of two values, one of which,`reservourBalanc_e`, is obtained from `token_. balanceof( address( this))`, and ` delta Dripp_ `. The result is stored as ` to Dip _ `.
Finally, a call to` token _. transfer (target _, to driip_)` is made, passing the address of` target _` and` to d rip _ ` as arguments.
Therefore, in this function call, to_Dip is data-dependent on b.
