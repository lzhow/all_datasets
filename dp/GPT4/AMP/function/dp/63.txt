The contract does not have any explicit data dependencies. However, the `_partitions` array is used to track partitions, and the `totalPartitions` variable is incremented or decremented when partitions are added or removed. These operations can affect the value of `defaultPartition`, which is a contract-level state. Therefore, it is possible that the state of the array `_indexOfPartition` could be affected by these operations, which could make it a source of data dependence.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "contract-wide state". Could you please explain?
  
  The contract has a state that is shared across all functions and is stored in-memory on each node of a blockchain. This state is updated when functions are called and can be accessed by all other functions in that contract. In the example code provided, `indexOfPartionsOf` is an example of this contract wide state, as it tracks the index of each partition in `_partions`.
