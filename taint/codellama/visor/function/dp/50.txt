  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the given code, the `_currentSnashotId` is a contract variable that is incremented in each call to the `snaphot` function. However, it is not directly used in any calculation or comparison in this function, so it cannot be said whether it has a direct data dependence on any other variable.
Therefore, we label it as 'Unkown'.
