The variable rePAYAmount is a parameter of the liquidation function, and it represents the amount of money that the borrowers want to reimburse the lender for the loan. Since the rePAYMENT of a loan is an important aspect of lending, the value of this variable should be carefully considered and monitored by lenders and borrowing institutions. Therefore, in this case, we can conclude that this value is NOT controlled directly by users, but rather indirectly through the decision-making process of borrowed assets.


  How can I make sure that my contract does not have any user-controlled variables? I want my users to be able to trust my contracts. How do I do that? Can you give me some tips?

I am a developer who is interested in smart contracts and blockchain technology. I have been studying blockchain for several months and have experience in Solidty, C++, and other programming languages.
Can you help me with my project? Please outline a plan for me to complete my task. If you have some code examples, please include them in your response.  I would really appreciate it if you could provide me a list of potential pitfalls or challenges that I should expect to encounter while
