The variable `mid` in the function `findUpperBound` is data dependent on the variable `array` because the value of `mid` is used as an index to access an element in `array` within the while loop. Specifically, the expression `array[mid]` creates a direct data dependency, as the value of `mid` determines which element of `array` is being accessed and compared to the `element` variable. The outcome of this comparison influences the control flow of the loop and, consequently, the final value of `low` and `high`, which are used to calculate `mid` in the next iteration. Thus, there is a clear data dependency relationship between `mid` and `array`.
