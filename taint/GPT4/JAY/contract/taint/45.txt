The variable `_sellNftFeeEth` in the function `updateFees` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `_sellNftFeeEth` is calculated based on the value of `_price`, which is obtained from an external data source (`priceFeed.latestRoundData()`). The user does not have direct control over the value of `_price`, so the variable `_sellNftFeeEth` is not controlled by the user.
