Reason: The variable `to` in the `withdraw` function is an address parameter that specifies the destination to which the `visr` tokens are transferred. The `isContract` function is a private function that checks if the address passed to it contains code, which is a way to determine if the address is a contract or an externally owned account (EOA). There is no direct data flow or computational dependency between the `to` variable in the `withdraw` function and the `isContract` function. The `to` variable is used independently of the `isContract` function, and the `isContract` function is not called within the `withdraw` function, nor does it influence the value of `to`. Therefore, they do not have a data dependency relationship.
