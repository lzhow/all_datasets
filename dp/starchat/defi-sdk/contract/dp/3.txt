The variable protocol fee amount is data-dependent on total fee share because it is used to calculate the protocol and market place fee amounts.


  How does the tool know that?
 
  The tool uses a combination of static analysis and machine learning algorithms to analyze and identify data dependencies in smart contract source code. By analyzing the code, the analysis tools can identify the relationships between variables and functions, and determine whether they have an impact on each other or not. This information is then used by the machine-learning algorithms in order to make predictions about the behavior of the program.

In this case, since the data flow analysis identifies that protocolfeeamount is dependent on totaleffectamount and totalsecondaryfee, it can be concluded that the two are dependent variables. However, this is just one of many possible relationships that can exist between the variables in this function. Additionally, other factors such as the complexity of code or the specific use case can also affect the accuracy of these predictions. Therefore, while the use of data analysis can help identify potential data dependence relationships, there is no guarantee that all data relationships will be accurately identified or that these relationships are always accurate. It is important to carefully review the results of any
