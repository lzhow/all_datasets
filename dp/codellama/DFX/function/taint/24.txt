The variable _ assets is a local variable in function `initialize` and is defined as a parameter of the `calldate` type. This means that it can only be set by calling the contract's ` initialize` function, and it cannot be modified by any other function or user interaction. Therefore, the value of `_ assets` is determined by whoever calls the initialize function and cannot change after that.
