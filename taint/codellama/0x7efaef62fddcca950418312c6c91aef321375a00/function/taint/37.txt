  
No, the ` fee to` variable in function `_m intF ee` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is set by a factory contract.

The `factory` contract is responsible for setting the fee, and the `_ mintF fee` function is called by `m i n t` to check if a fee should be charged. If a `f e eTo ` is specified in `IPan cakeFactory`, the factory will set the value of ` f eeto` in `_ m i  ntF  e  fee`. If no `  f  o  t  `is specified, ` _ m  i   n  tf  _  F  E  a  l  s  h  u  ll  b  y  d e f a u l t`.
