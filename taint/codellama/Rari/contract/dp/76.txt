  
No, the variables `pendingadmin` and ` supplierdistributorevent` are independent.

The variable`pengingadmin ` is a local variable in function `_setpendentadmin`, and it is only used to store the value of the `oldpendantadmin`. The variable is never used outside of this function, so it cannot be data-dependent on any other variable.  On the other hand, variable supplidistributeevent is an event emitted by the contract, and its value is determined by a combination of input parameters and the current state of other variables in contract. However, it does not depend on ` pendingadmin `.
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is no.
