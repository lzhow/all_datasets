  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `_doAddLiuquidty` function, the `OrinMultiPollLibrary` is used to calculate the optimal amount of token B to be added to the pool. This calculation is based on a quote from the Uniswap V2 library, which is a well-known and widely used library for creating liquidty pools.
This quote is calculated using the formula: `quote = amountDesire * reserveSrc / reserveDest`.
Here, `reservesSRC` and `reverveDest` are the reserves of the two tokens in question, and the amount desired is `amoutADeseired`.  The `orinMultipolllibrary` uses this formula to determine the best amount to add to token A, given the desired amount and reserveres of both tokens.  This is done in order to maximize the liquidtiy of th pool and to ensure that the price of each token remains stable.   The optimal value of ` amount B` that is returned by the library is then used in place of  ` amoutBdesired`, which was the original value passed to this function.   
Since the value returned from ` OrinMulitpoollibrary.QuoteUV` depends on ` AmountADesiired `, it is data-dependent on it.
