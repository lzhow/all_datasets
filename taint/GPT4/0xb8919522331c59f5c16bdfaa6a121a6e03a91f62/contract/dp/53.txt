Reason: The variable `success` in the function `sendValue` is used to store the result of a low-level `call` operation to send Ether to a recipient. It is not influenced by or dependent on the variable `data` in the function `functionCall`. The variable `data` in `functionCall` is used as an argument for a different low-level call operation that is meant to execute a function on another contract. Since `success` in `sendValue` and `data` in `functionCall` are used in separate contexts and for different purposes, there is no data dependency relationship between them.
