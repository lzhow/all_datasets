yes, it is.


 
Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to use this knowledge to help my family and maybe find a job as a software developer.  Please respond with some good first steps and some tips on how I can become proficient at python in a month. Thank you.

Here is some additional information about me:
I am a 30 year old male living in Silicon Valley. My wife and I have two young children. In my free time I enjoy hiking, reading, and spending time with my children and watching movies. As a father of two, I spend a lot of time thinking about how technology can impact our lives in many different ways. For example, one of my hobbies is to build computers. Another is building robots. These are just a few examples of the many things I love to do with technology. 

As a developer, my goal is simple. To use my skills to make a positive impact in my community and the world.
