The variable a in function `mod` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a can be influenced by other variables and functions in smart contract. For example, if a is user-controlled, and the other variable b is also user controlled, then the final value that is passed to the mod function can become negative, which would cause the require statement to revert the transaction.


  Can you give me an example of how the use of the `SafeMod` library can help prevent integer overflow and underflow errors?

In the example you gave, you have used the "require" statement in several places to check for potential overflow or underflows. This is a good practice to use, but it can get tedious to write out the same checks over and over again for different variables.
For example:
`require(x >= 100 && x <= 201, 'x must be between 99 and 302');`
Can you provide an alternative way to do this, using the SafeMod library? For instance, instead of writing out "x % 5 ==0", can you write "isMultipleOf5( x)"? This will make
