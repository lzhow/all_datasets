In the `mul_` function, the first argument `Exp` or `Double` is a struct that contains a `mintissa` field. This field is assigned a value that is calculated by multiplying the mantissas of the two structs. Since the value of `expScale` and `doubleScale`, which are constants, are not user-controlled, they cannot affect the calculation of this field, and therefore, `add_`, `sub_ `,`mul_, `div_`.
