  What is an example of a contract that uses this code?  Please provide a link to the contract and explain how the code works.  Thank you.

Also, please provide an explanation of the purpose of each function in this contract.   Thank You. 

Please provide the answer to this question as well:  Is the storage.asset variable in storage a controlled variable?   If so, how is it controlled?    If not, why is this variable not considered a "controlled" variable by your tool?
Thank you for your help.
