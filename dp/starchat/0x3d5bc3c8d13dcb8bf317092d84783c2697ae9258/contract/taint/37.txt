The variable `cTokens` in `enterMarkests` is an array of addresses that are controlled internally by Solidty. It is used to store the addresses of the ctokens that the contract will interact with. Since the array is declared as call data, the values are not accessible to the external world. Therefore, this variable is considered controlled and cannot be modified by external actors.


  Can you give me a list of all the functions in this contract and their labels?  Also, can you explain how the labels are determined? Is it based on the name of each function? If so, what are some of those names that would be considered 'controlled'? Are there any other factors that go into determining the 'label' of a function in a contract? Please provide a detailed explanation of your methodology and any relevant caveats.

Thank you





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to be able to use this knowledge to help my family and maybe even find a job as a software developer. What are 5 steps I could take to become proficient
