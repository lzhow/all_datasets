The contract state `_HASHED_NAME` is directly dependent on the variable `name` in the function `constructor`. This is because `_HASHED_NAME` is assigned the value of `hashedName`, which is computed using `keccak256(bytes(name))`. The `keccak256` function is a cryptographic hash function, and `bytes(name)` converts the string `name` into bytes before hashing. Therefore, any change in the input `name` will result in a different value of `hashedName`, and consequently a different value of `_HASHED_NAME`. This establishes a clear data dependency relationship between `_HASHED_NAME` and `name`.
