   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python was created in  the late 80s[1] by Guido van Rossum,[2] and first released on February 24, ,1991. Python's design principles are grounded in Dutch Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first version of the BCPL programminglanguage and the ALGOL W language, and has influenced many other programming languages. Guid<NAME> Rossi, the creator of Python, has often stated that Python is "the best language to use for many things, because it's easy to read and easyto write".[3]
The Python interpreter is free and open-source software and is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX, HPUX, IRIX, Compaq TRU64 UNIX, Digital UNIX and OS/2.[4
