The variable `reserveIn` in the function `getAmountOut` is not data dependent on the variable `numerator` within the same function. The `reserveIn` variable is used to calculate `numerator`, but the dependency does not go the other way around. The `numerator` is calculated using `reserveIn`, but `reserveIn` is determined independently from `numerator`. The value of `reserveIn` is derived from the `getReserves` function call and is based on the `pair` and `direction` inputs, while `numerator` is a subsequent calculation that uses `reserveIn` as one of its inputs.
