  
The variable _`vvris` in function `constructor` is labeled as 'Yes'.

This is because the constructor function initializes the `vVRIS` contract with the address of the `_visor` variable, which is passed as an argument to the contract. This means that the value of `_visor` can be controlled directly by a user who calls the contructor function.
