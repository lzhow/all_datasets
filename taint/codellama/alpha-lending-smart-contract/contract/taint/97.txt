The ``finished`` function is defined as a modifer in Soliidty, which means that it can be used as an annotation to modify the behavior of a function. In this case, `` finished`` is used to check if a ``Data`` object has been fully decoded. It does this by comparing the current offset of the object to its length. Since the offset is set to  zero at the beginning of each decoding operation, and the length is determined by reading the data from the blockchain, this check ensures that the entire data has not been decded yet.
