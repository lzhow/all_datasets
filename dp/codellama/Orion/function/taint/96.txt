  
The variable `W` in function `getWeth` is a public variable that is declared as `public immutables`. This means that it cannot be changed after it has been initialized, and it can be accessed by anyone. Therefore, the answer is 'No', the value of `w` cannot controlled be controlled or changed by user input.

In the code, `factory` and `supportedFactory` are also declared with the `immutable` keyword, but they are not publicly accessible. They are only accessible within the contract and cannot change after initialization.
