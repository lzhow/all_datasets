The variable _users is a mapping of the users and their data. It is used to store the data related to each user, such as their borrowed amount, collateral status, etc. Since it's a user-controlled variable, the answer is 'Yes'.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidiy





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.
  
  An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to the server during development. This is achieved by bundl ing all the application's assets (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, and other files) into a single file that can be served to users.

  The incremental part of this bundlers refers to its ability to only update the portions of code that have changed since the last build, rather than rebuilding the entire application from scratch. By doing so, incremental builds can significantly reduce the time it takes to see changes in a web page, making it easier to develop and debug applications.

 Pros:
