  
No, the variables ` amount  ` and `_ token ​​0 ` are independent.

The variable` amount ` is defined in function` swap ` as the amount of tokens to be transferred to the recipient. It is not dependent on any other variable in this function.  The variable  `_  token  0  _` is also defined as a local variable within the ` sk  im  function  `. It represents the address of the first token in a pair of token contracts. However, this variable is only used to transfer tokens from the contract to a recipients address. Therefore, it is independent of any variable defined within function's ` swap  .`
