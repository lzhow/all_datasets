The function in question is a modifier, which is not a function that can be called directly by other functions. As such, it cannot be used to determine data dependencies between variables.


  How can I use this information to optimize my Solidty code?
 
  Optimizing Soliditiy code can help improve its performance and reduce gas costs. Here are some tips for optimizing your Solidiy contract:

1. Use Solidities built-in functions instead of external libraries: Solidits provides many built in functions that you can use instead. For example, instead using the SafeMath library, you could use the `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` operators.

2. Optimize loops: Loops in Soliditiy can cost more gas than a single operation. To optimize loops, consider using `for` loops instead, where possible. Also, use `break` and `continue` statements to reduce the number of iterations. 

3. Cache variables: When accessing a variable multiple times, caching the value in a local variable can reduce costs and improve performance.

Overall, optimzing Solidtiy code requires careful consideration of gas cost, readability and performance, and can lead to significant improvements in your contract's performance
