In the ` functionfunctioncall` function, the` target` variable is passed as an argument to the internal ` _functioncal`l function. This function calls the contract at the address stored in ` target`, passing the data argument as a parameter.
Similarly, in`functionfunctionwithvalue`, the target variable` is also passed to` _ functioncallwith value` as the first argument. Therefore, `  ` is data-dependent on ` ` in this case.
