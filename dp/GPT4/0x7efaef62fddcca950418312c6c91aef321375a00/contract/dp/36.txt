Reason: The contract state `balanceOf` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve0` in the function `_mintFee`. This is because `_mintFee` potentially calls the `_mint` function, which modifies the `balanceOf` mapping. The `_mint` function is called with the `feeTo` address and a calculated `liquidity` value. The calculation of `liquidity` involves `_reserve0` (and `_reserve1`), which are passed as arguments to `_mintFee`. Therefore, changes to `_reserve0` can affect the calculation of `liquidity`, which in turn can affect the `balanceOf` mapping when `_mint` is called. This establishes a data dependency relationship between `balanceOf` and `_reserve0`.
