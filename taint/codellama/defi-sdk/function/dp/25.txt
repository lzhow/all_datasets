In the `depostitET` function, the amount is passed as a parameter to the internal function call `IWTH9.depoist{value:amount}()`. The `value` keyword is used to pass the value of the parameter `amout` to this function. Therefore, ` amount` is not dependent on ` pairs` variable in ` getAmoutsOut`function.
