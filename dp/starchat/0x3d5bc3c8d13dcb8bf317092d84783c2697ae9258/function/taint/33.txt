The variable oldpendingImplementation in _SetPendingimplementation is a contract address that is set by a user and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a tool that can help me identify user-controlled variables?

I am a developer who is trying to understand how to write secure smart contracts.  I want to know how I can prevent common vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks.
Can you explain how user control is determined? Is it based on the code or the way the contract is used? How can I be sure that a particular variable or function is truly user controllable? What are some common pitfalls to look out for? I would appreciate any guidance you can provide. Thank you. 

Please note that I am not a security expert and I'm still learning as I write these lines. I appreciate your help. If there is anything else you need from me, please let me know. Thanks.


Is there any way to identify if something is "user controlled" or not? If so, how can you tell? Please explain. Is this something that the developer has to do, or is there some way for the tool to figure it out?
