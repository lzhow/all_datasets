In the `calculateRoudDownLiqidtySharAmount` function, the local variable 'pool' is assigned the value of the 'poo'l's storage at the address of '_token'. The 'totalLiquiity' variable is also assigned a value from the same pool storage.
Therefore, 'Pool' in 'calculatRouDown LiquiditShardAmount' function is data-dependent on '_Token' because it is used to access the pool' storage and retrieve the total liquidity and total LiqidiyShards.
