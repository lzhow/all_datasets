  
No, the `_ balances ` contract variable is not dependent on ` er c7 2 3 TokenAddress ` in ` buy NFT s `.

The reason is that the ` _ balance s ` variable stores the balance of the NTFs bought by the user, and it is updated in a separate function called ` burn `, which is called after the transaction is successful.
On the other hand, `er c 7  2  3  Token Address` is a parameter passed to the  ` bu y N F T s` function, but it does not affect the value of `_ balance s`.
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
