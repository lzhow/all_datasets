  
No, the `` variable in function `` on ER C1 5 6 Received is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The function is called by an external contract, and the value of the parameter is determined by that contract. Therefore, this variable is under the control of an untrusted external actor, which is a security risk.
