  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `pairFor` function, the value of `tokenB` is passed as an argument to the internal function call `IOrinPoolFactory.getPool(address, address)`. This means that the address of the pool is determined by the values of both `address factory` and ` address  token B`.
On the other hand, in ` get AmountOut Curve` , the argument `from` of type `uint 2 5 6`is passed to `ICurvRegistry. get _coins_ indices ()` , which returns a tuple of three values.
Because the first two values in this tuple are determined solely by ` factory ` and` token A `, and the third value is dependent on ` token  B `and` from ` , it is clear that ` x ` is data-dependent on` factory `.
Therefore, we can conclude that` x` depends on both`factory `in` pair For`and ` from`in `Get Amountout Curv`.
