   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python was created in  the late 80s by Guido van Rossum, and first released in December ,  **1989**.[11][13]  Van Rossaum wrote the first version of Python in around 40 days, from December to February ,  *1886*.[14]
