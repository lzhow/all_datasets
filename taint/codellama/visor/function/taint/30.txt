  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the constructor of the contract, the `string` type variable named ` name` is passed as an argument. This variable is used to set the name of a new ER2C721 contract. However, this variable does not appear to be used in any other part of code, so it's unclear whether it should be considered controlled or not.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether the value of `  name ` is under the control of user or the developer.
