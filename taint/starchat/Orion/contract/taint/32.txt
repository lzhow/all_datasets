   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I currently have a decent amount of experience in other languages such as C++ and Java, but I have never really done any coding at all.
   If you are interested in learning how programming works, the best way is to start with a simple project. Choose a project that interests you and that you can do with others. For example, you could create a program that solves a problem you have, or that helps you learn a new language. Then, start by learning the basics of Python. This can be done by reading books, watching tutorials, and practicing on websites such a Codecademy. After that, move on to more advanced topics suchs as classes, functions, loops, etc. As you progress, take your time and do not be afraid to ask for help. Good luck!
