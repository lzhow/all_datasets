  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `viewNumerairAmount` function, the `_asssim` parameter is passed to the internal `IAsssimilater` interface, which is then used to call the external `ViewNumaraireAmmount` method. This method takes two parameters: `_dst` and `_amount`. The `_amnt` variable in `OutputRaw` is not directly used in this method, but it is used indirectly through the call to `delegate` which passes the value of `_ammount`. Therefore, `_aamt_`in ` viewNumeiraireAmout`is data-dependent on `_ amnt_ in`OutputRa`.
