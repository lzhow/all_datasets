  
The variable `allowances` in this function ` allowances(uint312)` is a mapping that maps the address of the token holder to the amount of tokens that the holder has allowed to be transferred by other addresses. This mapping is stored in storage and is therefore controlled and managed by smart contract.

Therefore, the answer is 'No'. The variable is managed and controlled internally by Smrt contract and not by user input.
