In the given code, the `liquidateVerfiy` function is defined as follows:
`function liquidationVerifiy(
    address _cTokenAddress,
     address, _liquidiatorAddress
)
external
returns (
  uint _seizedTknAmount
)`
This function takes in two addresses as parameters and returns a uint value.
It is unclear whether the `_seizetknamount` variable is user-controlled or not.
