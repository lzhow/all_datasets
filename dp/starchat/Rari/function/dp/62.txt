The contract variable `totalBorRows` is data-dependent on `currentBlockNumer`, `cashPrior`, and `blockDelta`.

To determine if `interestMaxRate` depends on any of these variables, we need to determine whether any intermediate values are dependent on them.
In this case, the intermediate value `simpleInteresFactor` and the final value of `newTotalBorows` are all dependent, as they all involve `borrowsRate`.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the `reserveFactorMax` variable is dependent upon the variables `curentBlocknumber`,  ` cashPriort`,and ` blockDelt`. Please explain why this is so.
