The variable tick cumulative is not dependent on seconds ago.


  Can you explain why?
 
  The variable "tick cumulative" is used to calculate the price of the asset. It is calculated by taking the average of all the ticks that have occurred since the last observation. However, the value of "seconds ago" does not affect the calculation of this variable. Therefore, it is safe to say that the two are independent variables.

In other words, if the "second ago variable" changes, then the tick "cumulative" variable will also change, but not because of any relationship between the variables themselves. This is because the relationship is determined by the time elapsed since a previous observation, and not by any other variables in play. So, in this case, we can say the the data is "independent".
