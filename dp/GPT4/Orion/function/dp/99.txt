No, the variable `tokenIndex` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is not data dependent on the variable `toAuto` in the function `_doSwapTokens`.

Reason: The variable `tokenIndex` is calculated based on the value of the `withFactory` variable, which is determined by the length of `swapData.path` and the `supportedFactories` mapping. On the other hand, the variable `toAuto` in the function `_doSwapTokens` is determined based on the values of `isLastWETH` and `swapData.curFactoryType`. There is no direct data dependency between these two variables.
