The variable `nextWeekBlock` in the function `getReleaseAmount` is data dependent on the variable `lastBlock` in the same function. The reason for this is that `lastBlock` is used to determine the upper bound of the range within which the release amount is calculated. Specifically, the line `uint256 toBlock = _toBlock < lastBlock ? _toBlock : lastBlock;` ensures that `toBlock` does not exceed `lastBlock`. Since `nextWeekBlock` is subsequently calculated based on `toBlock` (as seen in the line `nextWeekBlock = toBlock < nextWeekBlock ? toBlock : nextWeekBlock;`), any changes to `lastBlock` could potentially affect the value of `nextWeekBlock`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `nextWeekBlock` and `lastBlock`.
