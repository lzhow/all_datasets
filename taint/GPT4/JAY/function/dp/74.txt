Explanation: The variable `success` in the function `buyJay` is not directly dependent on the variable `success` in the function `buyJayNoNFT`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `success` in `buyJay` that depends on the value of `success` in `buyJayNoNFT`. However, there might be an indirect dependency if the value of `success` in `buyJayNoNFT` affects the state of the contract, which in turn affects the execution of `buyJay`. Without further information about the contract state and the execution flow, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency between these two variables.
