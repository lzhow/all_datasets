   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, and it has a large amount of libraries that can be used to make things easier. However, I do not know where to start. I also heard it can get complicated really quickly, but I am not sure if that is true. If anyone could give me a list of good places to begin, that would be great. Also, if there are any good books or websites that have tutorials for python, those would also be helpful. Thank you!
