Label: Unknown

Reason: The variable `sqrtRatioAX96` in the function `getAmount1Delta` is a parameter passed to the function. Without additional context about how the function is called and who has the ability to call it, we cannot determine whether `sqrtRatioAX96` is controlled by the user. If the function is called by another function that is publicly accessible and allows users to pass in arbitrary values for `sqrtRatioAX96`, then it would be controlled by the user. However, if the function is only called internally by the contract and the value of `sqrtRatioAX96` is determined by the contract's logic or state, then it would not be controlled by the user. Since the provided code snippet does not include this context, the control over `sqrtRatioAX96` is unknown.
