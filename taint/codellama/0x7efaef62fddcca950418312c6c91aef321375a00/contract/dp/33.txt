  
No, the ` value` variable in function `_safe Transfer` is not dependent on variable` _ token  ` in ` skimming` function.

The reason is that the `_ safeTransfe`r function is called with the` token` parameter set to`_ token`, which is a local variable within the scope of the constructor. This means that `token` will always have the same value as` `_ token `, and therefore the value of` value `will not be affected by the change in` ` _toke`n.
