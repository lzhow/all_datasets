  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `while` loop of the findLowerBound function, the value of `high` is calculated using the average function from the Math library. This average is dependent on both `a` and `b`, which are the values of variables `array` (which is an array of uint) and the element being searched for. Therefore, `averge` function is data-dependent on `element` which is a variable in `Arrays` library and is also data depend on variable low.
