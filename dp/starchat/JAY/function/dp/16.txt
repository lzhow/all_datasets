The contract has a function called update fees. This function is used to update the fees for the marketplace. In this function, there are two fee variables that are updated. These variables are sellNFTfeeEth and buyNFTFeeETH.

First, the program analyzes the code to see if the variables sellNFtfeeETH and BuyNFTfeETH are dependent on any other variables. It does this by looking at the mathematical operations that occur within the functions. Specifically, it looks at all the operations involving multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. 

In this case, since the price variable is not modified within this code, we can conclude that the two fees are independent of each other.
