  
No, the `variable refunAmount ` in function  `execute` is not dependent on ` hashesAccountsignaturData ` variable in ` validateandExpirAccountSignture` function.

The reason is that the two functions are called in different contexts. In the first function, `function execute`, the variables `input`, `output`, and `swapDescription` are passed as arguments, and the local variables are defined within the scope of the execution of this function only. On the other hand, in  the second function , ` function validate and Expire Account Signature`,  variables  are also passed  as  arguments but the  local  variable  is defined  within  scope  of  execution  only  for  this  function .
  Therefore,  there  exists  no  data  dependency  between  these  two  functions.
