Yes, `compoundLiqudityBalance is data-dependent on ` totalColleteralBalance`. This is because the value of ` compoundLiquidityBalanace` is computed using the `pool.compunded` value, which is dependent on both `liqudiity` and `borrowBalance`, and the final value for `collateraBalance ` is also dependent of the same two values.


  Can you explain why this is true?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain how this works.

In the first function, the loop iterates over all the tokens in `tokenList`. For each token, it computes the compound liquidiy balance and borrow balance for the user. It also computes a boolean value `userUsePoloAsColateral` which indicates whether the pool is used as collaterl for this user or not. 

The second function computes ` poolPrizePerUnint` using `priceOracle` contract. This value is then used to compute the liqidity balance in base currency. Finally, we add the computed values to the corresponding variables.


So, in short, both functions are correct, but the second one is more efficient because it
