The `updateFactoriess` function takes two parameters: `_factoriestype` and `_types`. The ` _ factoriests` parameter is an array of addresses, and the `_ types` is also an  array. These arrays are passed as arguments to the update function, but they are not user-controlled. Therefore, `I_Scope_​  `0 is a variable created internally by solc and is therefore not under the control of a user
