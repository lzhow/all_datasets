   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but this is my first time trying to program. Can you recommend a few good resources for me to use to get started? I'd also appreciate it if you could recommend some good first programs to write. Thank you!
   

  What are some of the most popular first projects to create when learning howto code? Please provide a short description of each and a link to where I can learn more.  Thankyou!  I am specifically looking for beginner projects that are relatively easy but still have some complexity. Some examples of projects include: a basic calculator, a to-do list, or a simple "Hello World" program for a specific language. If possible, please also include a list of prerequisites for each project. For example, if the project is "a to do list", please list the minimum skills and tools that a user would need in order to be able to complete the task. This will make it easier for people
