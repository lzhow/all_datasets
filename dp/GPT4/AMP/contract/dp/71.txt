Reason: The variable `lastValue` in the function `_removeTokenFromPartition` is used to manage the state of partitions within the contract, specifically for the purpose of updating the list of partitions when tokens are removed from a partition. It is assigned the last partition in the `_partitionsOf[_from]` array, where `_from` is the address from which tokens are being removed.

On the other hand, the variable `_tokenHolder` in the function `_isOperator` is used to check if a given address (`_operator`) is an authorized operator for the token holder's account. This function checks the `_authorizedOperator` mapping to determine if the operator is authorized.

There is no direct data dependency between `lastValue` and `_tokenHolder` because they are used in different contexts and for different purposes within the contract. `lastValue` is concerned with the management of partitions, while `_tokenHolder` is used for checking operator permissions. They operate on different state variables and do not influence each other's value or state.
