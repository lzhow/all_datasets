Based on the provided two snippets of code, it is evident that the semantic equivalence between them cannot be definitively determined. 

In terms of mathematical operations, while the first snippet of Java code may be syntactically and semanticallty correct, its execution will likely result in a runtime error in certain cases due to the mutation at line 41. Similarly, in the C++ code snippet, there is a similar syntactic and semantical error, albeit in another spot, which would result it in an incorrect execution and an output different than intended.  

Additionally, looking at the execution flow of these programs, they will most likely require different inputs to reach the end result, thus providing two different outputs. Furthermore, if a mathematical function was to run these code snippets, and the mutations made were not detected and resolved, one could argue that such changes could introduce unintended consequences in other parts of the program.
