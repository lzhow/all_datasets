The variable ctoken is a contract address that is passed as an argument to the mintverify function. It is therefore controlled indirectly by a user who is calling the contract, as opposed to being directly controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is directly or indirect controlled? I'm not very good at math. Can you explain it to me like I have five years of high school math knowledge? Please provide examples too. I want to understand this concept so I can better understand how to write better code. Thanks.

I'm trying to figure out if I should use the word "indirect" or "direct" when talking about the control flow of a program. For example, if you have a function that takes a parameter x and returns 2x, is x directly passed to that function, or is it indirect?
If x is direct, then it's value is copied to a new variable, and the new value of x in that scope is changed. If x was indirect, the value would remain unchanged. Indirect control is important because it allows for more flexibility and control over the program, but it can also be confusing and difficult to reason about. What are your thoughts on this? Is there a better way to think about
