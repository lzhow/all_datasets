  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `_transerByDefualtPartion` function, the `bytes` variable named `data` is passed as an argument to the  `_calPostransferhooks` method. This ` data` argument is then passed to `_getpartitionprefix` which is a function that returns the prefix of the partition.
  The ` topartitionPrefix ` variable is assigned the value of ` _getpartionprefix(_totpartition)` which means that it is dependent on `_totpartiton`.
   Therefore, `totPartitioPrefix is data-dependent on _totparition`.
