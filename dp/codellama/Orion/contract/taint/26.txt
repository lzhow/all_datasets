  
The variable amount A in function `_add liquidty` is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user input.

In the code, the `addliquidtyFromexchange` function takes in `uint amountAdesire` as an argument, which is then passed to the `_ addliqudity` internal function. This means that the value of ` amounta` can vary depending on the input from the calling function, and therefore is under the control of the end user who is calling the contract.
