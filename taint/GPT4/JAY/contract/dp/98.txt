The variable `_tokenAddress` in the function `buyJayWithERC721` is not data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `onERC1155Received`. 

Reason: The variable `_tokenAddress` is used as a parameter in the `buyJayWithERC721` function to transfer ERC721 tokens. It is not affected by or dependent on the `data` variable in the `onERC1155Received` function, which is used as a parameter in the `onERC1155Received` function to receive ERC1155 tokens. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
