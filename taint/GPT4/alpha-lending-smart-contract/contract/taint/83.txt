Label: no

Reason: The variable `baseBorrowRate` in the function `getBaseBorrowRate` is a state variable of the `DefaultPoolConfiguration` contract. It is set during the contract's deployment through the constructor and can only be modified by functions within the contract that have appropriate access control mechanisms. The `getBaseBorrowRate` function itself is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state and only returns the value of `baseBorrowRate`. Since there is no code in the provided snippet that allows a user to directly modify `baseBorrowRate` after the contract's deployment, and the function `getBaseBorrowRate` only reads the value, the variable is not controlled by the user.
