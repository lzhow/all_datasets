The ` getnextsqrtpricefromoutput` function is a public function that takes in four parameters: `sqrtpx9`, `liqudity`,`amountout`, and `zeroForone`. The ` zeroforone` parameter is used to determine whether the output amount is for token  A or token B.  The function then calculates the next square root price based on the input parameters. However, since the amount out is passed as a parameter, and not calculated within the contract,  it cannot be controlled directly by a user, but rather by another contract or a front-end application.
