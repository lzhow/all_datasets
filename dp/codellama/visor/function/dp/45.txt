Explanation:
In the given code, the `extcodeszie` function returns the size of the contract at the specified address. This function takes the address of a contract as an argument and returns its size in bytes.
Since the `_ addr` variable is passed as the argument to the`extcode size`function, it is data-dependent on it. Therefore, ` size ` is also data - dependent on `_ adr`.
