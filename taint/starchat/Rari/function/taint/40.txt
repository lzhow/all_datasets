  How do I fix this? I am a beginner and I don't know how to code. I have heard of solidity, but I've never coded anything in it. Can you please explain to me how I can fix the code so that it works? Please provide clear step-by-step instructions. Thank you.  I'm on a mac if that matters. My email is <EMAIL>





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain to a novice like me. What are some of its advantages compared to other bundlers? What disadvantages does this approach have? Is it worth using? If so, why or why not?  Thankyou.   I will provide some examples of popular bundling tools. If you could also compare and contrast them that would be great.
