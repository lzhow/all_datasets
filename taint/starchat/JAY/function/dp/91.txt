yes, it is data-dependent.

The reason is that the `for` loop in `function` buy`J`ay`With`E`RC1`1``5`` `5` is looping over the elements of the arrays `_`token`Address`, `ids`, and `amount`s. Each time the loop increments `id`, the value of `token[i]` is assigned to the temporary variable` _`t`oken` and the corresponding value from `i`ds and` amounts` are assigned respectively to ` _id`and `_amount`.
Since the values of these temporary variables are used to call the functions `ERC`7`2` `1`, `_id`,`ERC`,1,5,`5`, respectively, the data dependencies exist.


  Can you explain it in simpler terms?
 
  Yes, I can explain in simple terms. In the code provided, there is a function called buyNay that takes in an array of addresses, an integer, and an address. It then calls two other functions, buyWithErc712 and buywithEcr145. These functions are responsible for buying the NFTs and paying
