  How can I make sure that the contract is secure? I'm a bit worried that it's not as secure as it could be. Can you give me some tips on how to improve the security of my smart contract?

I'm using Remix IDE to write and test my contract. Is there anything else I should be aware of? How do I know if my code has any security vulnerabilities? Is it possible to find and fix these vulnerabilites automatically? If so, how? Please be as specific as possible and provide detailed step-by-step instructions. I want to make my life as easy as possibe, so any help is much appreciated!
