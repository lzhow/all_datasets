The contract state `totalSupplyByPartition` is data dependent on the variable `_value` in the function `transferByPartition`. This is because within the `transferByPartition` function, `_value` is used to update the balance of tokens within a specific partition when tokens are transferred from one address to another. Specifically, the `_removeTokenFromPartition` and `_addTokenToPartition` internal functions, which are called within `transferByPartition`, use `_value` to subtract from and add to the `totalSupplyByPartition[_partition]` respectively. This creates a direct data dependency as the state of `totalSupplyByPartition` for a given partition is modified based on the value of `_value`.
