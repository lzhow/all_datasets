Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `index` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is not directly dependent on the variable `holders` in the function `claimRewards`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `holders` in the calculation or manipulation of `index`. However, it is possible that the `holders` variable indirectly affects the value of `index` through the function `distributeBorrowerComp`, which is called within the loop over `holders` in the `claimRewards` function. Without further analysis of the `distributeBorrowerComp` function, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between `index` and `holders`. Hence, the label is unknown.
