Reason: The variable `_shareAmount` in the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount` is data dependent on the variable `paybackShares` in the function `repayInternal` because `paybackShares` is passed as an argument to `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount` when it is called within `repayInternal`. The line `uint256 paybackAmount = calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount(_token, paybackShares);` shows that the value of `paybackShares` is used to determine the value of `_shareAmount` within the `calculateRoundUpBorrowAmount` function. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between these two variables.
