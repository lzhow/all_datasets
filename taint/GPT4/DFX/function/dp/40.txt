Explanation: The contract state `_owner` is data dependent on the variable `newOwner` in the function `_transferOwnership`. This is because the value of `_owner` is being updated with the value of `newOwner` in the line `_owner = newOwner;`. Therefore, any changes made to `newOwner` will directly affect the value of `_owner`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
