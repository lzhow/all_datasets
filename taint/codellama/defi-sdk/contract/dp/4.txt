  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `execute` function, the variables `input`, `absoluteInput`, and `swapDescription` are passed as arguments to the internal function call `handleInput`. The `token` variable in `Input` is used to determine the type of token being transferred, and the amount is passed to `SaferC.2302` to transfer the token.
However, in this case, `amount` does not depend on `balances` because it is not used in any calculations. It is simply passed directly to another function. Therefore, it does depend only on itself.
