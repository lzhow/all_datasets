  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not very good at Solidty





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples?

An incremental bundling tool or bundlers is used to bundle together the various components of a web application into a single file that can be served to the client. This allows for faster loading times and a better user experience.
There are several types of incremental bundle tools, including:
- Traditional bundlere tools like Webpack and Rollup that bundle all the files together into one file.  This is useful for applications that do not require incremental loading. They can also be used for libraries that are not expected to be consumed directly in a browser. For example, libraries used in server-side rendering. These tools work by recursively crawling the dependency graph of the project and bunding all files that depend on each other. Then, they generate a bundle that includes
