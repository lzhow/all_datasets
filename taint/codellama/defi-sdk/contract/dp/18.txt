The variable length is not dependent on pairs in getAmoutOut.  The length variable is initialized to the length of the pairs array. It is then used to iterate through the array and calculate the amount out for each pair. However, the value of length does not change during the execution of get Amounts Out. Therefore, it is independent of pairs and does  not have data dependence on it.
