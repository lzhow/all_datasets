   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I currently have a decent amount of experience in other languages such as C++ and Java, but I have never really done any coding. I know some basic syntax, and I've used some data structures and algorithms before, so I'm familiar with those. What would be a great way for me to start learning python, without too much prior experience? Please provide some resources as well, if possible. Thank you!
