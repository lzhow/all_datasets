No. The variable `borrowAmount` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `supplierTokens` in the function `distributeSupplierComp`. 

The reason is that there is no direct assignment or computation between these two variables. The value of `borrowAmount` is computed based on the `CToken` contract's `borrowBalanceStored` function and `marketBorrowIndex`, while the value of `supplierTokens` is obtained from the `CToken` contract's `balanceOf` function. There is no direct relationship or dependency between these two variables.
