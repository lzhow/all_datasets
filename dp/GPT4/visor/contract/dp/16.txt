Reason: The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is used to store the code size of the address `account` and is determined by the `extcodesize` opcode in the EVM, which is only related to the `account` parameter passed to the `isContract` function. On the other hand, the variable `target` in the function `functionCall` is an address on which a low-level call is being performed. There is no direct relationship or dependency between `size` and `target` within the scope of their respective functions. The value of `size` does not influence `target`, nor does `target` influence `size`. They are used in different contexts and for different purposes within the library.
