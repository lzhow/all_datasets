  
No, the variables ` data` and ` value` are independent.

The function  `from` creates a new `Data` object and initializes its `offset` field to  zero. It also initialises its  raw field with the given bytes.  The function does not modify the `raw` or ` offset` fields of the  object. Therefore, it is not possible for the value of ` raw` to be modified by the call to ` decodebytes6`4`.
