  
No, the `_ reserves1 ` variable in function `getReserve` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is defined in a function and it can't be modified by any external user or function.

The variable is assigned a value in line 42 of the code, which is `uint _ reserver1= reserve ​​1;` and the value is taken from the `reservoir1`. The ` reserv1 is a state variable of a contract and is stored on the blockchain, so it cannot be changed by an external party. Therefore, `_ reserve` cannot  be controlled or modified  directly by a user, and its value can only be updated by calling the` _ update` function, but this function is also called internally by other functions in this contract, such as `m int` and `burn`.
