The function sendAlphareward has a parameter _ amount, which is a uint 2 5 6 type.

However, the getUseraccount function does not have such a variable. Therefore, it cannot be data-dependent on it.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that the variables `totalLiqudityBalancebase`, ` totalcollateralbalancebase` and `totallBorrowbalanceBase` are dependent on `_ amount`.
 
  Yes, these variables are indeed data dependencies on _Amount. Here's why:
- The function "getUserAccount" loops through a list of tokens (tokenList) and calculates the total liquidiy, collaterals, and borrows for each token.  The calculation involves compounding the balances over time.  
In the loop, each iteration calculates a compunding factor for the liqidity and borrow balances. These factors are based on how much the user has borrowed or supplied. If the factors change, then the totals will also change. For example, if the borrow balance increases, but the compound factor decreases, that means the actual borrow amount will decrease. This means that if a user borros
