yes, the `_amt` variable in `viewOriginswap` is user controlled.

  What is this variable used for? I don't see it being modified in any way. Is it safe to assume that it's not user controllable? If not, how can I make it so?

Also, what is `us_` in front of `mul` and `div` functions? Is this some sort of custom function? How can it be used? Can I just use regular `*` and `/` instead? What are the advantages of using `US` versions? 

I'm not very experienced with Solidty, so I apologize if these are basic questions. I'm just trying to learn as much as I can.
Can you explain these to me? Please provide some examples if possible. Thank you!
