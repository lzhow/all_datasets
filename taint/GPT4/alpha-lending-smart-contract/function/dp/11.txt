The variable `compoundedBorrowBalance` in the function `getUserPoolData` is data dependent on the variable `_amount` in the function `borrow`. The reason for this is that `compoundedBorrowBalance` is calculated using the function `getUserCompoundedBorrowBalance`, which likely takes into account the user's total borrow balance from the pool. In the `borrow` function, when a user borrows an amount `_amount`, this value is added to the pool's `totalBorrows` and the user's `borrowShares` in the `userData`. Since `compoundedBorrowBalance` is expected to reflect the compounded state of a user's borrow balance, and this balance is affected by the `_amount` borrowed, there is a direct data dependency between these two variables. Changes to `_amount` in `borrow` will affect the user's borrow balance, which in turn will affect the `compoundedBorrowBalance` when `getUserPoolData` is called.
