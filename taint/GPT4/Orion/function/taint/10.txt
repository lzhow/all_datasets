Explanation: The variable `amountOut` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned a value based on the internal logic of the function, specifically the result of the `_doSwapTokens` function. The user does not have direct control over the value assigned to `amountOut`.
