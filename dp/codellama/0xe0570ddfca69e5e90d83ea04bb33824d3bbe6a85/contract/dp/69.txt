  
No, the state variable _ name is independent of the local variable token in function InCaseTokenGetStruck.

The reason is that the _ token variable is a local parameter of function, and it is only used within the scope of this function. It is never used to update the value of _ _Name, which is an instance variable of type string. Therefore, there is nothing that would cause the data in _ Name to change based on changes to _ Token.
