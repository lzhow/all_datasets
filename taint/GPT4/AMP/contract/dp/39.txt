Reason: The contract state `_totalPartitions` is an array that keeps track of all the partitions that have been created within the contract. It is modified by functions that add or remove partitions, such as `_addPartitionToTotalPartitions` and `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions`.

The variable `_data` in the function `_transferByDefaultPartition` is a bytes array that can contain arbitrary data and is intended to be used for passing extra information with token transfers. This variable is not used to directly modify the state of `_totalPartitions`. The function `_transferByDefaultPartition` calls `_transferByPartition` with the `defaultPartition` and the `_data` variable, but within `_transferByPartition`, `_data` is used for hooks and validation purposes, not for modifying `_totalPartitions`.

Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between `_totalPartitions` and `_data` in the context of the `_transferByDefaultPartition` function.
