In the `getpair()` function, the pair variable is assigned the value of the IORionpoolV1Factory.get pair() function. This function takes two arguments, `token A` and `Token B`, which are passed as arguments to the get pair function in `PairFor()`. The `address` of `factory` is passed to `IORIONpoolv1factory.GetPair()` as an argument.
  The function returns the address of a pair contract.  In the base unit to curve decimal function , the amount variable  is used to calculate the decimal value. In this function the asset address is also used. If the Asset address 0 is equal to  the token A address, then the result is set to amount, otherwise, it is calculated using the decmials of token B.   The decimal Value is returned.
