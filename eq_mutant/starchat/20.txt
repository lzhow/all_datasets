This code and the mutated code differ in the line
`        diff=x *x -N`
As explained above, this line uses the post-increment syntax, where the value of the variable x is first read from memory and stored in a temporary location, then the result of that operation is modified, and finally the stored value is read back into the memory location. This can result in unexpected behavior, as modifying a value in memory may not have any effect on the actual value that is used in subsequent operations.
