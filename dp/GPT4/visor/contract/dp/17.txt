yes

The variable `s` in the function `recover` is data dependent on the variable `signature` in the same function. This is because `s` is directly extracted from the `signature` byte array using Solidity's inline assembly. The line `s := mload(add(signature, 0x40))` loads 32 bytes of data from the memory address that is 0x40 bytes after the start of the `signature` data into the variable `s`. This establishes a clear data dependency, as the value of `s` is determined by the contents of the `signature` array.
