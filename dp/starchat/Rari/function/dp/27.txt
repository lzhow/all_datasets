The contract function 'drim' has a boolean expression that depends on two contract variables: 'block.numer' (block number) and the 'drpStart' variable.

To determine if the variables are dependent on each other, we can use a technique called "static program slicing" or "data-flow analysis". This analysis examines the code to determine how each variable is used and how it affects the other variables. In this case, the analysis shows that the block number is not used in any way that would affect the value of 'DrippStart'. Therefore, it can be safely removed from the equation. This leaves the relationship between 'Drripstart'and 'DRIPPED' as the only unknown variable in this equation, and we must assume that it may be dependent upon 'Block.Number'.
In general, data-dependence analysis is a complex and challenging task that requires a deep understanding of the program's behavior and data dependencies. However, in practice, some heuristics can help identify some data dependences. For example, if a variable appears on both the left- and right-hand sides of an assignment statement, then it is likely to be a dependent variable, even if it does
