Yes

The variable `success2` in the function `sell` is data dependent on the variable `value`. The reason for this is that `success2` is the result of a call to `dev.call{value: eth.div(33)}("")`, where `eth` is calculated based on the `value` variable through the `JAYtoETH(value)` function call. The amount of ETH to be transferred to `dev` is directly calculated from the `value` variable, making `success2` dependent on `value`. If `value` changes, the amount of ETH sent and consequently the result stored in `success2` could also change.
