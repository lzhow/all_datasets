  
No, the `bytes memory` variable `_data` in function `_transerByParition` is NOT controlled directly by user input. It is a parameter of the `_approvedByPArition()` function, which is called by `_trasferbyPartion()`. The `_allowedbyPArtition[]` array is also not directly controlled.

The `_balanaceOfbyParitition []` and `_totalSuplybyparition []` arrays are controlled indirectly by users through the transfer function.
