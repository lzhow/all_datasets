  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `repairBowrFres` function, the local variable`vars ` is defined and used to store the intermediate results of the calculation. In the`doTranferin`function, there is no direct reference to the variables in`repaiBorrFress`. However, `var` is used in `borrowBalancestoredinternal` and `subUint` functions, which are called by `dotransfer in`. These functions use the value of `accountborrows` to calculate the new balance of borrows. Therefore,`var `is data-dependent on`account borrws`.
