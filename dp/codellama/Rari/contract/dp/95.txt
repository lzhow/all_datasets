In the constructor function, the `InterstRateMode`l_ variable is passed as an argument to the `_setImplentationSafer` function. This function sets the implementation of the contract to be the address of `implementaion_`. Therefore, `insterstrateModel` is data-dependent on `implentation` because it is used to set the value of implementation in `_SetImplemenationSafter`.
