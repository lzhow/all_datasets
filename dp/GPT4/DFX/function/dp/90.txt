Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `_amt` in the function `viewNumeraireAmountAndBalance` is not directly used or referenced in the function `outputRawAndGetBalance`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between `_amt` and `_dst`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency between them if the value of `_amt` is used to determine the value of `_dst` in some other part of the code that is not shown in the given example. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
