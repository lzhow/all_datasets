Label: yes

Reason: In the provided Solidity function `claimCurrentAlphaReward`, the contract state `pools` is data dependent on the variable `reward`. This is because the variable `reward` is used to update the `totalAlphaTokenReward` property of the `pool`, which is a specific entry within the `pools` mapping. The line `pool.totalAlphaTokenReward = pool.totalAlphaTokenReward.sub(reward);` clearly shows that the new value of `pool.totalAlphaTokenReward` is calculated based on its previous value and the `reward` variable. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `pools` and `reward`.
