The variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeIncreaseAllowance` is not data dependent on the variable `spender` in the same function. 

Reason: The variable `newAllowance` is derived from the `token.allowance(address(this), spender)` expression, which retrieves the allowance value from the `token` contract for the `spender` address. The `spender` variable is passed as an argument to the function, and its value is used to determine the allowance. Therefore, the value of `newAllowance` is dependent on the value of `spender`, but not directly on the variable `spender` itself.
