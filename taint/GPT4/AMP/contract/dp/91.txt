Label: no

Reason: The variable `index` in the function `_removeTokenFromPartition` is used to manage the position of partitions within the `_partitionsOf` mapping and `_indexOfPartitionsOf` mapping for a given address. It is specifically related to the internal accounting of partitions that a particular address is associated with.

On the other hand, the variable `recipientImplementation` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` is used to hold the address of a contract that implements the `IAmpTokensRecipient` interface, which is called when tokens are received by a contract. This variable is used to ensure that the tokens recipient contract can handle the incoming tokens appropriately.

There is no direct or indirect relationship between `index` and `recipientImplementation` as they are used in completely different contexts within the contract. The `index` variable is related to the management of partitions, while `recipientImplementation` is related to token transfer hooks. They operate independently of each other and changes to one do not affect the other. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
