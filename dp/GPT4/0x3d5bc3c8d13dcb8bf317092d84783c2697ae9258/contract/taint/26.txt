Label: yes

Reason: The variable `mintAmount` in the function `mintAllowed` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is meant to be called from outside the contract, typically by a user transaction. The user calling this function specifies the value of `mintAmount`, which means that this variable is controlled by the user.
