The variable _isControlledByUser in this case would be "yes".

In the above code, the _ symbol is a string variable that is used to define the name of the token. This variable is declared as public and can be accessed by anyone. Therefore, in order to prevent unauthorized access or modification, this variable must be treated as user-controlled.


  How can I make sure that the `_isControledByTheUser` variable stays that way? I'm worried that if I don't do anything, someone could change the value of that variable in my code. Can you give me some tips on how to make it harder for people to change that value?
Can you also give an example of how I could make the code more secure by using the `private` or `internal` keyword? How would that change my answer to the previous question? Can I use the same tips you gave me before? Please provide detailed explanations for each step you provide. I want you to explain everything you do and why you are doing it.
I want to use these tips in a real-world project, so please provide code examples in Solidiy that demonstrate how these techniques can help me make my
