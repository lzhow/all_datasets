  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `balanceOf` function, the value of `snapShotId` is passed as an argument to the `_valueAT` method. This method returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the snapshot exists and the corresponding value.
If the boolean is true, then the returned value is assigned to `val`.
Otherwise, ` balanceof` will be called with the address of the account.  The ` _ beforeToken Transfer`function is called before the transfer of tokens. It updates the balance of both the sender and receiver. If the receiver is not the zero address, it updates their balance. Similarly, if the recipient is zero, their account balance is updated. In this case, both `from` and `to` are updated, so ` value` depends on ` amount`.
