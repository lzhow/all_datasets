Reason: The variable `signer` is computed using the `ECDSA.recover` function, which takes the `hash` (derived from `structHash`), `v`, `r`, and `s` as inputs. The `structHash` itself is derived from `_PERMIT_TYPEHASH`, `owner`, `spender`, `_nonces[owner].current()`, and `deadline`. The variable `value` is used in the `abi.encode` call to construct the `structHash`, but it does not influence the `signer` variable directly. The `signer` is determined solely by the signature components (`v`, `r`, `s`) and the `hash`, which includes the `value` but does not create a direct data dependency as the `signer` would be the same regardless of the `value` as long as the signature (`v`, `r`, `s`) is the same. The `value` is used to encode the message that is signed, but once the message is signed, changing the `value` would require a new signature to maintain the validity of the transaction. Therefore, `signer` is not data-dependent on `value` in the context of the execution of the `permit` function once the signature is provided.
