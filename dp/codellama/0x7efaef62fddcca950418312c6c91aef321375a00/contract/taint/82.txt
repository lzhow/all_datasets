  
No, the `permit` function is a public function in PanaceaER2C contract, and it does not have any user input parameters. Therefore, `PErmit_Typehash` is also not user controlled.

The `Permit` typehash is used to generate a unique hash for each permit signature, which is then used for verification. It is generated using the keystore library and is therefore not directly controlled or modified by any external user or smart contract.
