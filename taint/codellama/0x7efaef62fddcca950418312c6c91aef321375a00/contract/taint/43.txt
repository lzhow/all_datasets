  
No, the ` MIMIMUN_ LIQIDITY ` variable in function ` mint ` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a constant value that is set to  `  uint  public  constant  M INIM UM_ L IQ UID I T Y =  1  *   *  **  (  U  I  N  T  )  ;  `.

The reason is that the value of `MIMINUM LIQUIDIY` is hardcoded in  the contract and cannot be changed by any user input. It is a fixed value used to ensure that there is always a minimum amount of liquidty in a pair.
