   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all the time and want to do it myself. I have heard that it can be very rewarding to solve coding problems by yourself. Can you recommend a few good first projects? And can you also give me some good tutorials for those projects in particular? Thank you very much!


  There are many ways to get started with Python. Here are some suggestions:

1. Start with the official Python tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
2. Solve a problem on HackerRank or LeetCode: These websites have a wide range of coding challenges that you can try.
3. Build a web application using a framework like Flask or Django: This will help you learn the basics of web development and get experience with popular frameworks.


Once you have completed these projects, you should have an understanding of the basic syntax and structure of Python and can start solving more complex problems on your own. Good luck!
