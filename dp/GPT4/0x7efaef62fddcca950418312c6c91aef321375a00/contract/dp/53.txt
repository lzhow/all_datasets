Label: no

Reason: The variable `timeElapsed` in the function `_update` is calculated based on the `blockTimestamp` and `blockTimestampLast`, which are both related to the block timestamp at the time the function is called and the last stored timestamp, respectively. It is not directly or indirectly influenced by the state of the `_token1` variable in the `swap` function. The `_token1` variable in `swap` represents the address of the second token in the pair and is used for transferring tokens and checking conditions, but it does not affect the block timestamp values used to calculate `timeElapsed`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `timeElapsed` and `_token1`.
