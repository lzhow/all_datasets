  
No, the ` log _ sq r t  _  sq _ r _ t _ _` variable in ` get _ tick _ at _ s q rt _ ratio` is not dependent on ` r` from ` _ get_ tick_ at_ s _ q _rt _`.

The reason is that the value of `sqrt_rat_io` passed to `tick` does not change during the execution of the contract. Therefore, ` tick` will always have the same value, regardless of what ` sq_rt_r_t_i_o` was passed.
