Is the contract owner controlled?

In computer security, a contract account is a special type of account that is used to deploy and execute smart contracts on a blockchain. Contract accounts are typically created by a user or smart contract, and are associated with a specific piece of code that can be executed on the blockchain to perform a particular task.
Contract accounts have several key characteristics:
- They are not associated directly with any one person or entity, but rather with the code contained within the account. This code determines the actions that the smart-contract account can perform, as well as the conditions that must exist for the execution of those actions to occur. In other words, the owner of the private key associated to a smart account has the ability to modify the associated code, which can have significant consequences if not carefully managed.  This is why it's important to use a multisig wallet to control the funds associated a given smart contact. If the key is lost, or the wallet is compromised, there is no way to recover the control of that account without the help of other parties.
