Label: yes

Reason: The variable `swapType` is set by decoding the `callerCallData` parameter of the `callBytes` function, which is provided by the external caller of the function. Since the `callerCallData` is an external input that can be crafted by the user who invokes the `callBytes` function, the `swapType` variable is indeed controlled by the user.
