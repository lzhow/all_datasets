   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and being sent to youtube videos to watch. I want to do it the "right" way. What are some good first steps? I have heard that the best way is to just start coding and see where it goes. Is that true? If so, how do I start? Please help me. This is important to me because I need to start working on a project that I've been putting off for months. If I don't start now, I'll never get it done. Thank you.

I am a college student studying computer science. My goal is eventually to get a job with a big company like google or microsoft. Right now I'm just trying to build up my skills and learn as much as possible in as little time as posssible. So far I really like the idea of just starting to program and seeing where that takes me, but I worry that if I get stuck or donâ€™t know where to go next it could be very difficult to progress. Do you have any suggestions for me? How
