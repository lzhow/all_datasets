The function borrow() calls the internal function getBorrowAmount() to calculate the amount of cash that can be borrowed. This amount is then passed to the borrow function, which calls internal borrow(). The borrow amount depends on two factors: the current exchange rate and the total amount supplied by the lender.

In the case where the exchange is 1:1, the two amounts are equal. In this case, there is no data dependence between the variables. However, if the rate is less than Â½, then the number of tokens that a user can borrow is reduced, and vice versa.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "the current rate". Could you please explain?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on. I also want to use this as an opportunity to improve my english skills while doing this. Could any of the popular university offer this course? If so, what would you recommend and is it worth it? Please also tell me about the cost of this online course. Thank you
