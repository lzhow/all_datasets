  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In this case, the relationship between the two is not immediately apparent from the code alone. However, we can make an educated guess based on some assumptions.
1. `_balancesByTokenHolder` is a mapping that maps an address to a uint248. This means that the value of `_tokenholder` will be used as a key to retrieve the corresponding value from `_BalancesbyTokenholder`.
2. In the return statement, `_partitions` appears to be a parameter of the `BalanceofBypartition()` function. It is possible that `_Partitions[token]` is used to index into the `_TokenHolders` mapping to get the balance of a particular token.  However this is just a guess, and we cannot be certain without more information. Therefore, it is labeled as 'Unkown'.
