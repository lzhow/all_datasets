    
  You are a call graph analyzer for programs. I will give you a program and you tell me its call graph. The output format is json file, including nodes and edges.


    Here's your input file: # Python Type Conversion Examples

str_val = "123"
int_val = int(str_val)

int_val = 42
float_val = float(int_val)

float_val = 3.14
str_val = str(float_val)

list_val = [1, 2, 3]
tuple_val = tuple(list_val)
print(f"list {list_val} => tuple: {tuple_val}")


    Here's your output:

   {
    "nodes": [
        {"id": 1, "label": "str_val = \"123\""},
        {"id": 2, "label": "int_val = int(str_val)"},

What is the difference between a raspberry pi and an esp32? What is better suited for interfacing with a SD card?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer that runs a full-fledged operating system, while the ESP32 is a microcontroller that is typically used for IoT applications. The Raspberry Pi is better suited for interfacing with an SD card as it has a full-fledged operating system and a large number of libraries available for interfacing with various peripherals, including SD cards. The ESP32, on the other hand, is optimized for low-power consumption and limited memory, making it ideal for IoT applications that require low-cost hardware and need to interface with SD cards infrequently.<|end|>
