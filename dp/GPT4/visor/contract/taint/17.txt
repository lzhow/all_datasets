Label: No

Reason: The variable `_totalSupply` in the ERC20 contract is marked as `private` and can only be modified by the contract's functions. It is not directly controllable by the user. The only functions that can modify `_totalSupply` are `_mint` and `_burn`, and these functions are restricted to be callable only by the `owner` of the contract, as indicated by the `onlyOwner` modifier. Since the `owner` is typically a specific address set during contract deployment and not any arbitrary user, `_totalSupply` is not controlled by the user.
