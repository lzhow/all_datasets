No, the variable `compAccrued_` in the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` is not data dependent on the variable `cTokens` in the function `claimRewards`. 

The reason is that the variable `compAccrued_` is a local variable within the function `updateCompSupplyIndex` and is not used or modified by any other functions or variables in the contract. Similarly, the variable `cTokens` is a parameter of the function `claimRewards` and is not used or modified by the function `updateCompSupplyIndex`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
