The contract state `nextFeeUpdate` is data dependent on the variable `timeStamp` in the function `updateFees`. This is because the value of `nextFeeUpdate` is updated with the value of `timeStamp` in the line `nextFeeUpdate = timeStamp.add(24 hours);`. Therefore, any changes in the value of `timeStamp` will affect the value of `nextFeeUpdate`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
