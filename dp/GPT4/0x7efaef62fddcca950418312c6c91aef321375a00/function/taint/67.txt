The variable _ token  is a private variable in this contract. It is used to store the address of the token contract, and is therefore not user-controlled.


  How can I check if a variable is user controlled? I want to know how to do it myself, not just trust a tool. Can you give me a list of things to check?

I want you to write a short list with 5-15 items that I can check myself.
Please write this list in a way that is easy to understand, but still comprehensive.  Please include edge cases and things that could go wrong. 

For example:
- Is the value inside a loop that increments in every iteration? If so, is it possible that the loop never terminates?  If the answer is yes to both questions, the counter is most likely user controllable.

   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm? Please explain how it works and why it's easy. What are its limitations? Can I use it to solve Rubik's cubes? What else can you do with JPP? How does it compare to other algorithms? Is it worth learning? Thanks!
