Reason: The contract state `SECONDS_PER_YEAR` is not present in the provided code snippet, which means it is either defined in a parent contract or not at all. However, even if it were defined, it would likely represent a constant value representing the number of seconds in a year, which is a fixed value and would not have a data dependency on the variable `_token` or any other variable related to the token's state or value. The function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityShareAmountExternal` takes `_token` and `_amount` as parameters, but there is no indication that `SECONDS_PER_YEAR` would be used or modified within this function or that its value would depend on the token being passed to the function. Therefore, without additional context or code indicating otherwise, we can conclude that there is no data dependency relationship between `SECONDS_PER_YEAR` and `_token` in the context of the `calculateRoundDownLiquidityShareAmountExternal` function.
