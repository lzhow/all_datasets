Label: no

Reason: In the function `getFeeGrowthInside`, the variables `tickUpper` and `tickLower` are used independently to access different elements of the `self` mapping, which stores `Tick.Info` structs. The calculations for `feeGrowthBelow0X128`, `feeGrowthBelow1X128`, `feeGrowthAbove0X128`, and `feeGrowthAbove1X128` are performed separately for `tickLower` and `tickUpper`. The results of these calculations are then used to compute `feeGrowthInside0X128` and `feeGrowthInside1X128`, but at no point is the value of `tickUpper` directly influenced by or derived from the value of `tickLower`. They are parameters that represent different tick positions and are used to calculate fee growth within a specific range, but they do not have a data dependency relationship with each other within the scope of this function.
