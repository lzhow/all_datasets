The answer is no.

`_reserve` is not used in `if` statement, so it is safe to remove it from the equation.


  What about this code?
 ```
  function transfer(
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount
  ) public virtual override returns(bool) 
  {
    _transfer(
      msg.sende,
      recipient
    );
    return true;
  }

  function _approve(uint224 amount) internal virtual {
  // solhint-disable-next-line max-lines
  require((_allowances[msgSender][_msgsender] + amount >= _allowance[sender][recipient]), "SafeMath: addition overflow");
  _allowed[owner][spender] = (_allowed.sub(spend, allowance));
  emit Approval(owner, spender, allowed);
}
 }
 
  The answer to this question is yes.

  `_allowans` and `_allowed` are two different variables. `_approve` function is used to update the `_alowance` variable. However, `_approved` does not appear in any of the functions in this contract. Therefore, it can be removed from consideration. 

  Therefore the answer would
