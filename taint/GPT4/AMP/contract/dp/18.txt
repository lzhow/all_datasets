Yes

The contract state `_totalPartitions` is data dependent on the variable `_partition` in the function `_addTokenToPartition`. The reason for this is that within the `_addTokenToPartition` function, there is a conditional check to see if `_indexOfPartitionsOf[_to][_partition]` is zero. If this check passes, the `_partition` variable is then pushed onto the `_totalPartitions` array, which is a state variable of the contract. This means that the state of `_totalPartitions` can be altered based on the value of `_partition` within this function, establishing a data dependency relationship between them. Here is the relevant code snippet:

```solidity
if (_indexOfPartitionsOf[_to][_partition] == 0) {
    _partitionsOf[_to].push(_partition);
    _indexOfPartitionsOf[_to][_partition] = _partitionsOf[_to].length;
}
```

And later in the function:

```solidity
if (_indexOfTotalPartitions[_partition] == 0) {
    _addPartitionToTotalPartitions(_partition);
}
```

The function `_addPartitionToTotalPartitions(_partition)` is then called, which directly modifies the `_totalPartitions` state variable by pushing the `_partition` onto it. This further confirms the data dependency.
