Label: yes

Reason: The variable `amount0In` in the `swap` function is indirectly controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the balance of `token0` in the contract before and after the swap operation, which is affected by the `amount0Out` parameter. The `amount0Out` parameter is specified by the user when they call the `swap` function. If a user calls the `swap` function with a certain `amount0Out`, it will affect the contract's balance of `token0`, and consequently, the `amount0In` will be calculated based on this user-controlled action. Therefore, although `amount0In` is not directly set by the user, it is indirectly controlled by them through their interaction with the contract's `swap` function.
