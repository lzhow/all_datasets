Label: no

Reason: The variable `mathErr` is a local variable within the function `borrowBalanceStoredInternal` and is used to store the result of mathematical operations to check for errors. It is not used to read from or write to the contract state `totalSupply`. Since `mathErr` is not used to derive the value of `totalSupply` nor does it influence `totalSupply` in any way within the given function, there is no data dependency relationship between `mathErr` and the contract state `totalSupply`.
