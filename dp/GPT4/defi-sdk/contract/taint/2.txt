Reason: The variable `deadline` in the function `hashProtocolFeeSignatureData` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since function arguments are provided by the caller of the function, and in the context of a smart contract, the caller is typically an external user or another contract, the `deadline` variable is controlled by the user. The user can set this value to any uint256 value they choose when they call the function.
