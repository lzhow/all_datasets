Label: no

Reason: The variable `oldAdmin` in the function `changeAdmin` is assigned the value of the state variable `admin` before it is updated to `newAdmin`. The state variable `admin` represents the administrator of the contract, and its value is set during contract deployment or by the current admin through the `changeAdmin` function. Since `oldAdmin` is a local variable that simply holds the previous value of the `admin` state variable and is not directly set by user input or by a transaction sent by a user, it is not controlled by the user. The control over this variable is restricted to the current admin, as indicated by the `onlyAdmin` modifier on the `changeAdmin` function, which requires that `msg.sender` must be equal to the current `admin` for the function to execute.
