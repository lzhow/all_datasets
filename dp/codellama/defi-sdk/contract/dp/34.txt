  
No, the `variable absolute input amount` is not dependent on `the variable token amount in function` get absolute Input amount.

The reason is that the value of ` absoluteinputamount` depends on other variables such as `amounttype`, ` token`, and ` amount`. These variables are passed as arguments to the`getabsoluteinput amount function`, but they do not depend on each other. Therefore, `absolutinputAmount ` is independent of`tokenamount`.
