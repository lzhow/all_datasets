The variable r in withdraw is data-dependent on _tokens in incaseTokenGetstuck because the value of r is used to calculate the amount of tokens that can be withdrawn from this contract. If the balance of the contract is reduced, the withdraw function will withdraw more tokens than it should, which could cause the user to lose funds.


  I'm not sure I understand the question. Can you rephrase it?
 
  The question is whether the data dependence of variable "r" in function "withdraw" is dependent on variable "_token" of function"incaseTokensgetStucks".
 

  1. Is the "data dependancy" relationship between the variables "variable " r " in "function " withdraw " and " variable _ "token " of " functionin caseTokens getSticks" true or false?
  2. What is a "non-reentrant" function? Is it the same as a re-entrant function, and vice versa?

Please explain your reasoning.
Thank you
