Reason: The variable `receiverRuleList` is an array of `ReceiverRule` structs that is used to store the rules for releasing alpha (tokens or some form of value) to various receivers. The functions that modify this array, such as `setAlphaReleaseRule` and `removeAlphaReleaseRule`, are both guarded by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that only the owner of the contract, which is set upon contract deployment and can be transferred by the current owner, has the ability to call these functions and thus control the contents of `receiverRuleList`. Regular users cannot directly modify this variable; they can only interact with it if they are set as the owner or if the owner creates an interface that allows user interaction under certain conditions. Since the control over this variable is restricted to the owner, it is not controlled by a regular user.
