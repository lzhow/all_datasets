Reason: In the `setPool` function, the contract state `pools` is directly modified by setting its `totalBorrowShares` property to the value of the function parameter `_totalBorrowShares`. This establishes a data dependency relationship between the contract state `pools` and the variable `_totalBorrowShares`, as the state of `pools` is being altered based on the value of `_totalBorrowShares`.
