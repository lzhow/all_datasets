Reason: The variable `collateralAmount` in the function `liquidateInternal` is calculated within that function using the parameters `_token`, `_liquidateShares`, and `_collateral`. It is dependent on the state of the `pools` mapping and the `calculateCollateralAmount` function, which takes `_token`, `liquidateAmount`, and `_collateral` as arguments. However, it does not have a direct data dependency on the variable `_token` in the function `splitReward`.

The function `splitReward` is a separate internal view function that calculates the split of rewards between lenders and borrowers based on the current state of the pool associated with the `_token` passed to it. The variable `_token` in `splitReward` is used to access the `pool` state and calculate `lendersGain` and `borrowersGain`, but it does not influence or modify the state of the `collateralAmount` in `liquidateInternal`.

In Solidity, unless there is a direct reference or modification of state that is shared between functions (such as updating a state variable that both functions read or write to), variables local to a function do not have data dependencies with variables in other functions. Since `collateralAmount` and `_token` in `splitReward` are used in different contexts and do not share state, there is no data dependency between them.
