Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `data` in the function `finished` is an instance of the struct `Data`, which is passed as an argument to the function. Since Solidity functions can be called externally by users (unless they are marked as `internal` or `private`), the contents of `data`, including the `raw` bytes array and the `offset`, can be provided by the user when they call the function. Therefore, the state of the `data` variable can be controlled by the user.
