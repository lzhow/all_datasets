Label: no

Reason: The variable `a` in the function `lte` is an input parameter that is used to determine the return value of the function based on a comparison operation. It is independent of any external variables or state, and its value is determined solely by the arguments passed to the function when it is called.

The variable `secondsAgo` in the function `observeSingle` is also an input parameter that is used within the scope of that function to calculate a target timestamp and to determine the return values based on the state of the `Observation` array and other inputs.

There is no direct interaction or data flow between `a` in `lte` and `secondsAgo` in `observeSingle`. They are used in separate functions with no shared state or calls to each other, and the value of one does not influence or depend on the value of the other. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
