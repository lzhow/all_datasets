   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!




An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and images, into a single file that can be served to the browser. This makes it easier for the web browser to load the application and make it more responsive.

Webpack is probably the most popular example of an incremental bundle tool. It is designed to work with a variety of different types of files, including JavaScript (including npm packages), CSS (Sass and Less), images and HTML files. Webpack takes all of these files as input, processes them, then outputs a bundled file. By doing this, Webpack can optimize the output file by removing any unnecessary code, combining multiple files into one, optimizing images for faster loading, etc. All of this makes the final output more efficient and
