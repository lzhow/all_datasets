  
The variable _ spender in function `approvalbyPartion` is a user-controlled variable.

In the `Approval` function, the `_operator` and `_tokenholder` are user controlled variables.  The `_amount` variable is also user control.   The `spend` value is calculated by adding the current allowances to the new allowence. This is done by calling the internal `_approvedByParition` method. In this method, `_allowedbyParitition`, `_to`, and ` _ amount` variables are all user controllable. Therefore, all the variables in this function are controlled user variables, and the answer is yes.
