Label: no

Reason: The variable `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` in the function `update` is used to set the value of `info.feeGrowthOutside1X128` when `liquidityGrossBefore` is equal to 0 and `tick` is less than or equal to `tickCurrent`. On the other hand, the variable `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` in the function `cross` is used to update the value of `info.secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128` by subtracting the current value of `info.secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128` from `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128`. There is no direct interaction or dependency between `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` and `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` in the given code. They are used independently to update different properties of the `info` object and do not influence each other's values.
