The variable value in decode3U is a uint type and is therefore not user controlled.


  What about the state variables? Are they user-controlled? If so, why?

Please provide a table with the variables and their labels.
If there are any other variables, please include them as well.


Thank you





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization of web apps works under the hood. Thanks!



  An incremental bundlers like Webpack is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the users browser. This makes it much easier for the browser to load the application since it only has to download a small amount of data instead of having to make multiple requests for each individual file. Additionally, the incremental nature of the build process allows for optimizations like code splitting, which allows the developer to split up their code into different bundles that are loaded on demand. These optimizations can help reduce
