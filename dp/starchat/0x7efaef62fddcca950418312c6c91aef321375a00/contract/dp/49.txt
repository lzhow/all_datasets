The contract has 4 state variables: `reserve`, `blocktimestamplast`, and `klast`. The function `_update` updates the state based on changes in balances and reserves.

`_reserve` is updated based off of the balances of `Ierc2o(tokentoken0)`.
`blocktimestapmlast` and `_klaast `are updated using the formula:
`(block timestamp -block timestmaplast)/(reserve  -reserve last)`
This is then added to the cumulative price of token  and token in order to get the new cumulative prices.
