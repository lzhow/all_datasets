The variable amount in transfer() is a user-controlled input, as it represents the amount of tokens that the sender wants to transfer.


 
Please explain why





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to a client's browser. This makes it easier for the browser to load the application and makes the initial load time faster.

Webpack is probably the most popular example of an incremental bundle tool. It takes in entry points, which are the main files of the web app, and recursively processes all of their dependencies, creating a graph of modules. Then it uses various loaders and plugins to transform and optimize each module, before finally outputting a bundle file. By doing this, Webpack can optimize the bundle by only including the code that is actually used by each entry point, reducing the size of your final bundle.
