The variable `a` in function `mul_` is a parameter of the `Exp` struct type, which is defined in line 3 of your code. This means that the value of `m.aantiss`a is set by a user when they call the contract and pass in an `Exponen` object as an argument. Therefore, the state of this variable is under the control of a third party, and it cannot be considered as controlled solely by user input.
