  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `Saferc2O` library, the` safe Decreased Allowance ` function calls the `_call Optional Return` function, which calls `token` `approval` with the new allowances as arguments.
This means that the value of ` new Allowances` is dependent on ` spenders` because it is calculated as ` token` allow `ances (address (this) , spen` der) `sub` (value , " SaferC 2  O : decreasing allow` ance below` zero").
Therefore, `New Allow`ances is data-dependent on` spends` .
