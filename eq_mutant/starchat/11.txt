Based on the provided information, I will be able to determine that the following Java and C code examples are considered "semantically equivalent" and thus considered equal:
C:  ```double square(long a)
 {
     return a * a
 };```

 Java: ```public int square ( int a ) {
   int b= a*a;
   retur b;
  }```
