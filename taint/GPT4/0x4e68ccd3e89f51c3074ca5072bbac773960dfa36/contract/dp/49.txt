Yes

The variable `info` in the function `cross` is data dependent on the variable `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` in the function `cross`. This is because `info.feeGrowthOutside0X128` is directly updated using `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` in the following line of code within the `cross` function:

```solidity
info.feeGrowthOutside0X128 = feeGrowthGlobal0X128 - info.feeGrowthOutside0X128;
```

This line indicates that the new value of `info.feeGrowthOutside0X128` is calculated by subtracting its current value from `feeGrowthGlobal0X128`, which creates a direct data dependency between `info` and `feeGrowthGlobal0X128`.
