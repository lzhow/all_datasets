  
No, the ` pending Comtroller Implementation ` variable in function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a public variable that can be accessed by anyone.

The `public` keyword in Solidiy means that the state variable is accessible from outside the contract. This means anyone can read or write to the value of the pending comptrolller implementation variable. Therefore, this variable cannot be considered as controlled or not by a user, as it can always be modified by any external actor.
