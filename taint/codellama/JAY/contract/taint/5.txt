  
No, the ` er c1 5  ids` variable in function `buynft` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` buynFT` function is called by a user, but the value of the parameter `er c 7 6 8 9 4 3  id` s is determined by other factors, such as the smart contract' s logic and the data stored in other contracts. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled externally, rather than by an end-user.
