In the ER2C token contract, the `approval` function is used to allow a spending contract to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner. This function takes three parameters: the address of owner of tokens, an address that is allowed to spend the tokens (the spendee), and the amount of token that can be spent.
When the `_spendingAllowances` is called, `owner` and `amount` are passed as parameters. `Spender`, on the other hand, is a local variable that represents the spenndee. Therefore,  ` spener`is controlled  by  the  user  because  it  is derived  from  a  parameter  passed  to  `_approvedAllowences`.
