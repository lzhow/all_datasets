  
The variable `collteralpercent` in function `getCollterallPercent` is a public variable, which means that it can be accessed and modified by anyone. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.

In Solidiy, public variables are variables that are declared outside of a function and can therefore be read and written to by any function or external contract. They are not private, and their values can change at any time.
Public variables can also be modified directly by users, so it's important to ensure that they are initialized with the correct value and that any changes made to them are valid.
