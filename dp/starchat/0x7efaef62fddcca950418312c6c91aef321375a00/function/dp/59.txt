   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and being sent to youtube to watch random videos. I want to do it the "right" way. What books, websites, or other methods should I use to become proficient in writing python code? Please list them all and explain what they do. If I already know how python works, please tell me how much more I need to know. Also, if there are any courses I can take to get better at python, list those too. Finally, I don't want a list of 15 things I have to read, instead I would like a step by step plan of how I could learn it in about a month. For example, "Learn how variables work, how loops work and how functions work. After that, learn about classes and objects. Then, move on to modules and packages. And so on."
   

  What are some good books to start learning Python? I'm looking for something that's easy to understand and has practical examples
