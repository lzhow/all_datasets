The contract has a function called `getCurve` that takes two addresses as input and returns the address of the curve with the given base and quote currencies. This mapping is stored in a state variable called curves, which is a mapping from a unique identifier (a hash of these two currecies) to the corresponding curve contract address.

When a user calls the `CurveFacotry.newCurce` function, the factory generates a new curve and assigns it to a variable `curve`. The function then creates a hash from the base currency and the quote currency, and checks if this hash is already present in ` curves`. If it is, it reverts the transaction. If not, then it adds the new pair to ` curvers` and emits an event.


 
 
   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
   
    An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) that are required to run a web application. It is designed to optimize the performance of a website by reducing the number of requests made to servers, as well as optimize delivery of those assets to users.

    There are several types of incremental bundle tools,
