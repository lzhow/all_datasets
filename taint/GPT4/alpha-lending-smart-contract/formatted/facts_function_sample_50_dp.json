The function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier, which implies that there is a check to ensure that the caller of the function is the owner of the contract. However, this check does not create a data dependency between `_owner` and `_token` because `_owner` is likely a state variable that holds the address of the owner, and it is used to control access rather than to influence the computation or the logic that depends on the `_token` variable. The `_token` variable is used to interact with the ERC20 token contract and to manage the pool reserves, which are separate concerns from the ownership check. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency relationship between `_owner` and `_token` within the `withdrawReserve` function."

For each element, it retrieves the corresponding `Pool` object from the mapping `pools` using the address of each `ERC-2`0 token as the key. It then calls the internal function`getuserPooldata` to retrieve the liquid balance and borrow balance of a user in a specific pool, and checks if the user has any liquid or borrowed balance in that pool by comparing the retrieved values with  `0`. If the balance is not ` \u200b\u200b0`, it calculates the total liquid and total borrow balances of all pooled assets for the given user.\n  The `if` statement checks whether the collate percent is greater than 1 and whether user use pool as collatoral. If so, It calculats the compound liquid balace and adds it to the  total collated balance base.  It also calculatesthe compunded borrowbalance and add it tot the totla borrow base balance.   The function returns the calculated values. In the second function , it does the same thing as in first one. So, ` compondedLiquefitybalace` is data depend on ` totalcollatedbalancbase` because it is used to calculate the value of `totalliqueditybase`."
