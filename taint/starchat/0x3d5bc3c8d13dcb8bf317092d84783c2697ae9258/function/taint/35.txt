The variable redemptionTokens in this function is a return value that is set by this contract, and is used to indicate the number of tokens that will be redeemed from the c-token contract. Since this value is generated by internal calculations within the contract and not directly provided by a user, we can conclude that it does not fall under the control of the end user and therefore, is classified as "no".


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract that are not under user control?  I want to know the names and types of those variables.
 
  The following variables are controlled internally by Solidty and are therefore not considered to be under control by users:

- `isComptrller` (bool)
This variable is declared as a constant and cannot be modified by any function.
It is initialized to true in line 3 and used as an identifier to check if a contract is indeed a Comptrroller.


In addition, the `mintAllowed` and `borrowAllowed `functions check the balances of users and determine if they are allowed to mint or borrow tokens. These functions are called by other functions in order to determine whether or not to allow a transaction
