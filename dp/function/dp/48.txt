In the first function, the `_ total Supply ` variable is assigned the value of the `total Supplies` variable.
Then, in line 10, `MathErr ` is compared to ` MathErr. NO_ ERROR`.
If the two values are equal, then the return value is set to `(Math Error. No_ Error, Initial Exchange Rate Mantissa)`.
Otherwise, it is returned as `(math Err,0)`.  The ` math Err` value in this function is dependent on ` _ total supply`.
