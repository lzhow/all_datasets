Label: No

Reason: The variable `amounts` in the function `getAlphaReleaseRules` is not directly controlled by the user. It is an array that gets populated within the function by calling `getReleaseAmount` on each `IAlphaReleaseRule` instance associated with a `ReceiverRule` in the `receiverRuleList`. The values returned by `getReleaseAmount` are determined by the logic within the respective `IAlphaReleaseRule` contracts, which is not necessarily user-controlled and could be based on predefined rules or calculations that depend on the `_fromBlock` and `_toBlock` parameters. While a user can call the `getAlphaReleaseRules` function and provide the `_fromBlock` and `_toBlock` parameters, they do not have direct control over the `amounts` array elements themselves, as these are computed by contract logic.
