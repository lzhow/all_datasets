  
No, the variables ` amount 1 ` and `_ token  ` are independent in both functions.

The reason is that the `m int` function is only concerned with the balance of the token that is being minted, which is not the same as the `_toke n` variable in ` swap`. The ` _to ke n ` variable is used to determine the address of a token to be transferred to in a swap transaction, but it is a separate variable from the one used in minting. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions, and the answer is 'No'.
