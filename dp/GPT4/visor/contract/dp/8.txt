Yes

The variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeIncreaseAllowance` is data dependent on the variable `token` because `newAllowance` is calculated based on the return value of the `allowance` function call on the `token` object. The `allowance` function is a method of the `IERC20` interface, and it returns the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender. Here, `token.allowance(address(this), spender)` is used to fetch the current allowance value, which is then used to calculate `newAllowance` by adding the `value` parameter to it. Therefore, the value of `newAllowance` directly depends on the `token` variable's state.
