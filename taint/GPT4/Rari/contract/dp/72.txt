Reason: The variable `cToken` in the function `updateCompBorrowIndex` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called. It represents a specific CToken contract address for which the borrow index is being updated. On the other hand, the variable `i` in the function `_setCompSpeeds` is a loop counter used to iterate over arrays of CToken addresses and their corresponding speeds.

The two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes. The loop counter `i` does not influence the value of the `cToken` parameter in `updateCompBorrowIndex`. There is no direct data dependency between `cToken` in `updateCompBorrowIndex` and `i` in `_setCompSpeeds` because the value of `cToken` does not depend on the iteration of the loop controlled by `i`. They operate independently within their respective functions, and changes to `i` do not affect the value or state of `cToken` in `updateCompBorrowIndex`.
