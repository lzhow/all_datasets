The variable "data" in function "functionCall" is a user-controlled input. It is passed as an argument to the "call" method, which can execute arbitrary code. Therefore, the control flow of the program can be influenced by this input, and it can lead to arbitrary execution of code, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.


  Can you give me an example of how this could be exploited? I'm specifically looking for something that can't be done with other tools. I want to write a contract that exploits this vulnerability.

Also, can you explain how the compiler can detect this kind of vulnerability? Is there a way to make the contract more secure?
I'm not asking you to fix the code for me, I just want you understand the vulnerability and how to exploit it. If you can give a solution that doesn't require me to rewrite the entire contract, that would be even better. But if you have to do that, please tell me how. Thanks!
