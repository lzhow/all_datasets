  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the address of the current contract has sufficient balance to make the call. This check is performed before the actual call is made, so the balance of `address (this)` is used to determine if there is enough balance.
However, in function 2, there are two `call` statements, and the second one is dependent on whether the previous call was successful or not. If the value of success is true, then the next call will be made with the same value for `data`. Therefore, `success` is data-dependent on `value`.
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is yes.
