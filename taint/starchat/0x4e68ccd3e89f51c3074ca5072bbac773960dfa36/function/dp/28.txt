   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being stuck in tutorials all the time because I keep making mistakes and the code does not work. I want to create something useful instead of just following tutorials. What should I do? I have heard that university is good at teaching you how computers work, but I don't want that. A good answer would be very helpful. Thank you!
   

  What are some good textbooks for learning Python?  I'm specifically looking for books that will help me learn the basics, as well as intermediate and advanced topics.  Please provide a short list of titles and their approximate level of difficulty.

I'm looking to start learning python in about a month, and I'd like to do it in a way that's efficient and effective. If there are any books you recommend that would help, I would appreciate it if you could share them with me. 

Thank you for your help!
