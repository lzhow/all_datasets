Label: no

Reason: The variable `protocolFeeSigner_` is a private state variable in the `ProtocolFee` contract. It is set by the `setProtocolFeeSigner` function, which is an external function with the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that only the owner of the contract (as defined by the `Ownable` contract, which `ProtocolFee` inherits from) can call this function and change the value of `protocolFeeSigner_`. Since the owner is typically a specific account with special privileges (not any arbitrary user), the variable is not controlled by a general user but by the owner account. Therefore, the control over this variable is not in the hands of a general user, hence the label 'no'.
