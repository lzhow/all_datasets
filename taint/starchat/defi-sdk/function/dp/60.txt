The contract variable `_type_hash` is not directly used in ` getAbsolueInputAmout` function. However, it is used to compute the value of a local variable called `typeHash`. This local ` typeHash` variable is then used as a part of the condition in an `if` statement.

In the ` if` condition, the local type hash is compared to the constant value `0x00...0`. Since the typehash is a 32-byte value, and the comparison is done using 260 bytes of memory, this comparison will always evaluate to false. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the `_tye_type` and ` account` variables in this function call.


  Can you explain how the tool works in more detail?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain in detail how my tool analyzes Solidty contract codes and classifies data dependencies.

  First, my analysis starts by parsing the code into a syntax tree. This allows me to identify the relevant variables and contract elements in each function and determine their scope. Then, for each pair of variables, we check if they have an explicit data-dependence relationship, such as one
