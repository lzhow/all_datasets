The contract variable `nextFeeUpdateTime` is not used in any arithmetic operations, so it cannot be a source of data dependence for the state variable.

However, the value of `timeStamp` can be used to compute the result of the `require` statement, which can affect the control flow of subsequent code. Therefore, it may be possible for `sellNFTFee` to be data-dependent on `timestamp`.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are calculated?
 
  Sure! Data dependencies in smart contracts are determined by analyzing the code of a smart contract to determine which variables are used and modified within the smart contrac. If a variable is used within a calculation or assignment statement but is never modified, then it is considered to have no data or state dependency on other variables. However, if a variables is modified in a way that affects the calculation of another variable, or if the two are interdependent in some way, those variables will have data and state dependencies on each other.
