The variable borrowindex is a memory variable that is used to calculate the amount of COMP accruing to a borrowing user in a particular market. It is therefore not directly controlled or influenced by a user's input.


  How can I make sure that the borrow index is always up to date? I want to avoid the situation where a malicious user can manipulate the value of the index to make the system unprofitable. How would you recommend implementing this check?

I want the check to be as efficient as possible, since this function is called for every transfer of funds in every market that has COMP rewards enabled.
How can you modify the code to achieve this? Please provide pseudocode if possible. I understand that this is just an example, so you don't need to implement the exact code, but please provide a general overview of how you would implement this optimization. 

Thank you for your help!
