In the first pair, we see that the sematical difference is `bound = M +x` to `++x`. This does not change the output, as (x++) is equal to (X), so it is semanticall equivalent. In the second pair the difference in `i<data,length` (line 41 and 53) is only an increment in the index of the for loop, but it does affect their functionality. Similarly, line 72 and line88 have a difference of  `j+1` instead of ` j` on the right side, which changes the logic of how the loops work and makes them not semanticly equivalent, despite having the exact same value. However, lines 62-63 in Mutants  #2 `while(i < nums.size()) {` have ` i++ ` instead, and thus are also equivalent to the original program in terms of functionality, so these can also be removed from the semantic comparison. Overall, in both mutants, some lines can be safely removed or modified to achieve the desired effect, while others need to be kept to maintain the program's functionality; in total, this means the provided codes cannot be considered semanticially equivalent even
