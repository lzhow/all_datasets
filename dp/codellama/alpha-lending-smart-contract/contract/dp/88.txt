The variable  `in the` function  finished is not dependent on `the variable value`  function in ` decode bytes`.
This is because the `finished` variable is a local variable in function and is only used within the scope of the  decodebytes function. It is also not passed as an argument to the decode function, so it is independent of any other variable.
