The variable `reserveInput` in the function `_swap` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `reserveInput` is obtained from the `getReserves()` function of the `pair` contract, which is a predefined function and not influenced by user input. Therefore, the variable `reserveInput` is not controlled by the user.
