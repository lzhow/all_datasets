The variable _ tokenHolder in function `isoperator` is a user-controlled variable. It is used to check if a specific address is an operator for the current contract.

In Solidty, user input is typically not considered to be a secure source of information, and it can be dangerous to rely on user inputs to control the flow of code. In this case, the `_ tokenholder` variable is user controlled, which means that a malicious user could potentially manipulate the value of this variable to gain unauthorized access to the contract's functionality.


  How can I prevent this? I'm trying to write a security audit for my contract, but this is causing me a lot of problems. I don't want to have to manually check every single instance of user control in my code to make sure it's not mishandled. Is there a way to tell if something is "user controlled" or not? If so, how do I do it? Please help me!
