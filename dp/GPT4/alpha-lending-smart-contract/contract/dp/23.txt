The variable `data` in the function `decodeU32` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `decodeU256` because the latter calls the former as part of its decoding process. Specifically, `decodeU256` calls `decodeU128` twice, which in turn calls `decodeU64` twice, which then calls `decodeU32` twice. The `data` variable is passed through these function calls, and its `offset` field is modified during the decoding process to read the correct portion of the input bytes. This establishes a direct data dependency between the `data` variable in both functions.
