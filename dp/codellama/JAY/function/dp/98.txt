In the `JaytoEth` function, the value of the `` variable is used to calculate the return of `address.balancesub( value)`. This means that the balance of address `this` is dependent on `value`.
Similarly, in `EThtojay`, the total supply of tokens is divided by the address balance minus the amount of Ether sent. This also means the token supply is dependant on address balances.
Therefore, both variables are dependent in both functions.
