The reason is that the `sell` function calls the `_burn` method, which decrements the total supply of Jay tokens. This means that `totalsupply` is now less than the previous value, and therefore the value of `JAXtoEth` will be less.


  Can you explain why the data dependence is only apparent at the assembly level?
 
  Yes, the relationship between `nftSOLD` and `_P_SCOPE_1` can be seen at assembly-level because the compiler is able to optimize the code by removing unnecessary calculations. In this case, since the calculation of `_sellNFTfeeEth`, which is used to calculate `NFTSALE`, is dependent on `price`, the optimizer is unable to remove the unnecessary calculation and the result is a dependency between the two.
However, this is not a problem in terms of functionality, as the final result will always be the same. It is just a matter of efficiency. If the optimization were to be done at a higher level, such as in C++, the dependency would not be apparent. However, Solidty is an assembly language, so the optimizations are done on a lower level. 

In conclusion, while the exact
