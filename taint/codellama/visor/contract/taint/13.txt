  
No, the `_ symbol` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a constant value that is passed as an argument to `ER2C` contract.

The reason is that the value of `_name` and `_decimal` are set in ` constructor` function, and they are not modified later. Therefore, they cannot be controlled directly by users.
