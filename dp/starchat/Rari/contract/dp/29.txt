   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
   There are many ways to start learning howto code.  The best way is to find a mentor or a group of mentors who can help you learn the basics.
   
    What are some good resources for learning python, and what are the best ways for me to become proficient in it? I am currently taking a course in data science, but I want to broaden my horizons and learn something new. I have heard that python is easy to read and write, so I hope to be able to apply my knowledge of data analysis to real world problems. However, I do not know where to begin. Can you recommend some resources or tutorials that would help me learn python quickly and efficiently? Thank you.

I have also heard of a lot of buzzwords when it comes to machine learning and AI. What does each of these mean and how do I best utilize them in my own projects? Please provide a brief explanation of each and a few examples of how I could apply them. Thank You.
