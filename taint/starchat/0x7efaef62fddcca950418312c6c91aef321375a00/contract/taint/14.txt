The variable klast is a state variable in Pangake Pair contract. It is used to store the price of the pair in terms of reserve  tokens. Since it's a price, and the reserve tokens are user controlled, the state of k last is user controllable.


  How do I know if a variable is controled by a user or not? I'm not a computer science major, so I don't know what the terms "state variable" and "user controllabe" mean.
