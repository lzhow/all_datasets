  
No, the `setSuppComp` function does not depend on `CTokin`s in ` claimrewards`. The ` currentcomp speed` variable is set to  `compSpee`d s in` setcomp supply speed internal` and ` setcompsupply speed`. It is also updated in `_setcomp speeds`.

The ` ctoken` s variable in claim rewards is only used to iterate over the array of ctokens and update the comp supply index and distrubute comp to supppliers. It doesnot affect the value of `currentspeed`.
