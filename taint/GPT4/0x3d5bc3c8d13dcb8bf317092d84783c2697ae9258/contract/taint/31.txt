Reason: The variable `seizeTokens` in the function `seizeAllowed` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is designed to be called from outside the contract, typically by a user or another contract. The value of `seizeTokens` is determined by the caller of the function, which means it is controlled by the user who initiates the transaction that calls `seizeAllowed`.
