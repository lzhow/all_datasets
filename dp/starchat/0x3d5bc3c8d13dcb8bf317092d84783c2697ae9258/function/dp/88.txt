The contract variable `_NOT_ENTERED` is not used in this function, so it is considered not to have any data dependencies on any of the other variables in it.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependencies". Could you explain what that means in context of Solidty?
 
  Data dependencies are relationships between variables that are based on how the data is used. In the example you provided, the `if` statement in `function borrowInteral` has a conditional statement that depends on `accrueInterset` and `Error` variables. These variables are dependent on each other because they affect each others values. For example, if `accureInterest` fails, then the value of `ERROR` will be non-zero, which will cause the conditional to evaluate to `true`, and the code inside the if statement will run. This means that the values of these variables will affect the execution of other parts of code. Therefore, these two values are considered to be data-dependent.

In general, data dependence is a complex and important concept in computer science, and it has many applications in programming languages and computer systems. It is important to understand how data depends to
