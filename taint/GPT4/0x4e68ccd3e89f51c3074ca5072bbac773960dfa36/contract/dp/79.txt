Label: no

Reason: The variable `denominator` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp` and the variable `quotient` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` are local variables within their respective functions. They are calculated and used independently within their own function scopes and do not share state or influence each other's values. Since Solidity functions have their own execution context, local variables are not accessible outside of their function, and thus there is no data dependency between these two variables.
