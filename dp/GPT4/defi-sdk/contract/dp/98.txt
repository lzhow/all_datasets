The variable `inputToken` in the function `callBytes` is passed as an argument to the function `approveAndCall`. This establishes a direct data dependency between the `inputToken` in `callBytes` and the `inputToken` in `approveAndCall`. When `callBytes` is called, it decodes the `callerCallData` to extract the `inputToken` and other parameters, and then it calls `approveAndCall` with `inputToken` as one of its arguments. Therefore, any changes to `inputToken` in `callBytes` will directly affect the value of `inputToken` in `approveAndCall`.
