The variable `tokenA` in the function `pairFor` and the variable `output` in the function `_swapCurve` are not directly related in the given code snippet. The function `pairFor` takes `tokenA` and `tokenB` as inputs and returns an address, while the function `_swapCurve` takes `input` and `output` as inputs. There is no direct assignment or usage of `output` in the `pairFor` function. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency relationship between `tokenA` and `output` based on the given code.
