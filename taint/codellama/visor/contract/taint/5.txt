  
The variable vvris in function `depost` is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user through the `mints` function.

In the contract, the owner of the token can mint new tokens by calling the mint function, which is only accessible to the smart contract owner. Therefore, if a malicious user has access to a token, they can call the mints function to mint more tokens and gain control over the system.
