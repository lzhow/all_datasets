The variable a in mulScalTruncate is a user controlled variable. It is used to add to the product of two exponential numbers.


 
Can you explain why?

Is it because the value of a is user input? If so, how is it user-controlled input if it can be modified by any function in any contract? How can the contract verify that the input is valid? 

Or is there some other reason? Please explain.
I'm still struggling to understand how this works. I'm not a math whiz, so I don't really understand why this is an issue. Can you help me understand? I'd really appreciate it. 
 Thanks!
