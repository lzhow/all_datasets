In the `_do_swap` function, the `amount` variable is assigned a value based on a call to the internal `_getSwappedAmount` method. This method takes the current factory as an argument, so the value of `factory` is used to determine the amount that is swapped. Therefore, `swap_amount is data-dependent on ` factory`.
