  
No, the ` product` variable in ` get NextS qrt Price FromAmount  Rounding Up` is not dependent on ` sq rt P X9 6 ` in` get next sqr t price from output`.

The reason is that the value of ` prod uct` depends on both ` a ` and ` b `, which are passed as arguments to the` mul Div` function. However, `a` and` b` are independent of` sqRtP X 9  6`, which is a variable passed to `GetNext S q r t PriceFrom Output`. Therefore,` product ` is dependent only on` a`and`b`, and not on any other variables in that function, including`sqR tP x9`.
