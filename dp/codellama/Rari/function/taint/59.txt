  
The variable `redemptionFloor` in function ` redemUnderlyin` is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the `redemption floor` variable is defined as a local variable in this function, and it's not clear whether it can be controlled directly by a user or not.
It is possible that the value of this variable can change based on the input parameters of the redenomination function or other factors, but it depends on how the contract is implemented.
