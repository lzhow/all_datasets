  
No, the `_hashedVersion` variable in this function `hashAccountsignaturedata` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a private variable and it can only be accessed by internal functions.

The `_Hashedversion` function returns the hash of the input data, which is a public function, and the data is passed as a parameter to the `keccack224` hash function. Therefore, this variable is generated by a combination of public and internal data and is therefore not under the control of a user, but rather a result of internal calculations.
