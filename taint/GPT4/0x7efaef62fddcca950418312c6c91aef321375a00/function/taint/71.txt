The variable "decimals" in this function is **not** controlled directly by users. It is a constant value that is used to define the number of decimal places in token amounts. This value is set by convention and does not need to be changed by user input. Therefore, the value of "decimal" is considered to **NOT** be controlled or influenced by any user inputs.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "not controlled" or "influenced" by a user's input in that context. Could you please rephrase your question?

Also, please provide the context for this code, as it appears to have been copied from a larger program. I would like to know what the larger code does, so that I can better understand the purpose of this snippet.
In addition, could you provide a more detailed explanation of what "user input" means in relation to this question, and how it relates to the code in question. Thank you. 

I appreciate your help. Let me know if you need any more information.  I am a beginner, learning as I go. So please bear with me. Thanks.
