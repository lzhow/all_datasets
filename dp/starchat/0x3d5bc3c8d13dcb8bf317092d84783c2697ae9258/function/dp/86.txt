The contract variable `exchange rate` is not directly used in this function. However, it is used to calculate the value of `balance`. Since Soliditiy does not allow for function calls in expressions, the calculation of the balance cannot be performed directly in Solidty. Therefore, a new variable, `Exp memory`, is declared to store the result of this calculation. This variable is then used as an input to the `mulScalarTrucate` function, which performs the actual calculation and returns the final value.

In summary, since the exchange rate is a contract-level state, and the input `owner` does have an indirect dependency on it through the use of a mapping, this means that the data-dependence relationship between `exchage rate`, `accountTokens`, and `ownder` cannot always be determined statically.


  Can you give me a shortened version of that explanation?
 
  The contract variables `Exchange Rate` and  `Account Tokens` are used together to compute the output `Balance`. The function call `MulScalarTrunc` computes the product of these two values and stores the results in a temporary variable. Finally,  the temporary value is returned as the computed balance. Since the relationship
