The contract state `compAccrued` is data dependent on the variable `newAccrued` in the function `updateContributorRewards`. This is because the value of `newAccrued` is used to update the value of `compAccrued` in the following line of code:

```
uint contributorAccrued = add_(compAccrued[contributor], newAccrued);
```
