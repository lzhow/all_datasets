Reason: The variable `_allowances` in the ERC777 contract is a mapping that tracks how much allowance an owner has given to a spender to transfer tokens on their behalf. This variable is controlled by users through the `approve` function, which allows a token holder to set the allowance for a spender, and the `transferFrom` function, which allows a spender to transfer tokens up to the amount they have been allowed by the token holder. The control over this variable is given to users by the design of the ERC20 token standard, which ERC777 also implements. Therefore, `_allowances` is controlled by the user, as they can set and modify the allowances through transactions they initiate.
