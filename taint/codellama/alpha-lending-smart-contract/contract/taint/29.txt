The variable 'rate_slo1' is a public variable in a contract that is derived from the Ownerable contract. It is set in its constructor and can be changed by calling the renouncementOwership function. However, the contract does not have any functions that allow the users to change the value of the 'ratesloe' variable. Therefore, 'ratelope1 ' is considered to be controlled  by  the  contract  and  not  controlled   by   the   user .
