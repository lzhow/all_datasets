  What is a good way to mitigate this?  I want to make sure that the contract is secure and that I can trust it.  How can I do that? I am a beginner at solidity and smart contracts. I have heard that it's important to use modifiers to limit access to certain functions. Can you explain how to do this in this contract? Please provide an example of a modifier and how it would be used in a function. Thank you.

Also, how can you tell if a contract or function has a bug? Are there any tools or methods you can use to check for potential vulnerabilities? If so, please provide examples. If not, why do you think that is? Thank You. 

I am also wondering if there are any resources you could recommend to help me learn more about solidity, smart contract development, and security. Anything from academic papers to online courses would help. Again, thank you for your help and time. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Let me know if you need any more information. Have a great day.
