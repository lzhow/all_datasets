Explanation: 

The variable `interestAccumulated` in the function `finishInterestAccrual` is not directly dependent on the variable `repayAmount` in the function `liquidateBorrowInternal`. There is no direct assignment or calculation involving these two variables in the given code snippet. Therefore, the data dependency relationship between `interestAccumulated` and `repayAmount` is unknown.
