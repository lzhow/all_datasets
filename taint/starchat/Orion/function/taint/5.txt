   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I currently have a decent amount of experience in other languages such as C++ and Java, but I have never really done any coding.  If you are interested in learning how  to program in Python, there are several resources available to you. Here are some suggestions:

1. Start with the official Python documentation: The Python website has a comprehensive and extensive documentation on Python. It covers everything from the basics of the language to more advanced topics. To get started, you can start with The Quick Start Guide and work your way through the tutorials.

2. Join online communities: There are many online Python communities where you  can connect with others who are learning to  code. Reddit has the r/learnpython subreddit, which is dedicated to helping beginners learn Python and programming in general. Stack Overflow also has an active community of programmers who can help you with coding questions.

There are also many other resources online, such  as YouTube channels, that offer Python tutorials and courses. Some of these resources are free, while others offer paid courses or access to additional materials
