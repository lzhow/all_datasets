Label: yes

Reason: The variable `tick` in the function `getTickAtSqrtRatio` is calculated based on the input parameter `sqrtPriceX96`, which is provided when the function is called. Since the function is marked as `internal pure`, it can only be called from within the contract or from other contracts that inherit from it. However, the value of `sqrtPriceX96` that ultimately determines the value of `tick` can originate from user input if the contract's design allows users to influence this parameter through a transaction. Therefore, without additional context on how `getTickAtSqrtRatio` is used within the broader contract, we assume that `tick` can be indirectly controlled by the user, hence the label "yes".
