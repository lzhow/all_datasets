In the original code, it checks if `bound` (which is equal to `data [first]`) is less than ` data [upper]` and increments `upper` if it is. However, in the mutated code snippet, `~ bound` has been added to the condition, which means that the code will check if  ` bound ` is greater than  data  [ upper] and decrement  upper  if so. This change will cause the algorithm to sort the array in a different order.
