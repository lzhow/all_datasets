The contract constructor takes two parameters: `_strategy` and `_name`. The `_symbol` parameter is not used in this function, so it is omitted for simplicity.

In Soliditiy, the order of function parameters is important. In this case, `_approvDelay`, which is a contract parameter, is passed as the second parameter to the constructor. However, Solidty does not enforce the ordering of parameters, and the compiler may choose to pass the parameters in a different order. Therefore, it's not possible to determine whether the `approvaDelay `contract state is data-dependent on `_approveDelay`.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data-dependence". Could you explain it to me?
 
  Data dependence is when one variable or value depends on another variable. For example, if you have two functions, one that calculates the square of a number and another that multiplies two numbers, then the output of the first function depends directly on both the input and output values of both functions.
