  
No, the `contract state token` is not dependent on `_variable` `_0token` because the `_ token  ` is a contract-level variable that is initialized in a constructor, whereas `_ variable _0 token `is a function-local variable.

The `constructor` function is called only once when the smart contract is deployed, and it initializes the values of the variables in memory. On the other hand, `_initialize`is called every time the`initialize `function is executed, which can be multiple times during the lifetime of a smart contact. Therefore, ` _variable _  token _` can have different values each time it is used, while ` token_` will always have the same value.
