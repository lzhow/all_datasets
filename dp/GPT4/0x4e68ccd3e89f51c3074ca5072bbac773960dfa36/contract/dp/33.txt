Label: no

Reason: The variable `tick` in the function `position` is an independent input parameter and does not rely on any external variables or state. The variable `compressed` in the function `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord` is calculated within that function's scope using its own input parameters (`tick` and `tickSpacing`). Although both functions deal with a variable named `tick`, they are scoped to their respective functions and do not share state or data. The `tick` in `position` is not influenced by the `compressed` variable in `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord`, hence there is no data dependency relationship between them.
