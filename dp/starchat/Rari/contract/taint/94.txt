The variable 'fuseAdm' is a contract address that is set by a user and is therefore controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? Is there a tool that can help me with that? I am not very experienced with solidity. I have heard that you can use symbolic execution to check if variables are user controllable. Can you explain that to me? How would I use that tool? What is symbolic execuction? Please explain it in simple terms for a layman. Thank you.

I am asking you this because I want to make sure that I do not make any mistakes when writing smart contracts. If you could help with this it would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you for your help. It is much appreciated!
