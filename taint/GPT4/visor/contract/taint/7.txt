Label: No

Reason: The variable `owner` in the contract `vVISR` is set during the contract's deployment and is intended to represent the owner of the contract, which is typically the deployer or an entity that the deployer designates. The control of this variable is not open to arbitrary users of the contract; it is specifically managed by the contract's logic. The `transferOwnership` function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address, but this action can only be performed by the current owner, as enforced by the `onlyOwner` modifier. Therefore, the `owner` variable is not controlled by arbitrary users, but by a specific user with the appropriate privileges (the current owner).
