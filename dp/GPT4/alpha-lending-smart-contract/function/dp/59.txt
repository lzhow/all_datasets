Label: yes

Reason: The variable `pool` in the function `setPool` is data dependent on the variable `_token` in the function `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmountExternal` because `pool` is a reference to an entry in the `pools` mapping, which is indexed by the address of the `_token` parameter. The line `Pool storage pool = pools[address(_token)];` shows that the state of `pool` is directly determined by the address of the `_token` passed to the function. Although the two variables are in different functions, the dependency exists because the state of `pool` is contingent on which `_token` is used to index into the `pools` mapping.
