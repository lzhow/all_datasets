When `_mint` is called with `initialSupply` as an argument, it indicates that `initialSupply` tokens are being created and added to the total supply.

The `_mint` function is called within the constructor, which is responsible for creating an initial amount of tokens and assigning them to the `msg.sender`'s balance. Although the `_balances` state variable is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, it is implied by the ERC777 standard and the `_mint` function's behavior.\n\nThe ERC777 standard extends the ERC20 token standard, which includes a `_balances` mapping to keep track of the token balance of each address. When `_mint` is called, it increases the balance of `msg.sender` by the amount of `initialSupply`. This means that the `_balances` mapping is updated to reflect the new balance for `msg.sender`. Therefore, the state of `_balances` is directly dependent on the value of `initialSupply` because the initial tokens minted are equal to the `initialSupply` and this amount is added to the `_balances` under the `msg.sender`'s address.\n\nIn conclusion, the contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `initialSupply` because the initial balance of the creator of the contract (`msg.sender`) is set based on the value of `initialSupply` through the `_mint` function."

The variable `defaultOperators` is passed to the ERC777 constructor but does not influence the `_mint` function or the `_totalSupply` directly.

Since there is no direct interaction or dependency between `_totalSupply` and `defaultOperators` in the provided code, we can conclude that `_totalSupply` is not data dependent on `defaultOperators`."
