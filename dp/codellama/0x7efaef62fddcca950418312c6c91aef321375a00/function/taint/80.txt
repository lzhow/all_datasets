  
No, the `permit_typehash` variable is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled. It is defined as a public pure constant in both the IPancakPair and IPanchakeER2C interfaces, and its value is set to  `0xe7735a94027680b51c81390936b33d50a8b28865`. This value does not change and cannot be modified by any user, making it a non-user-controllable variable.

The `approval` function in PanaceaPair also uses this constant to generate the EIP-721 signature. This signature is used to verify the authenticity of the approval transaction and to prevent unauthorized access to the contract. Therefore, `permite_Typehash ` is an important variable that is critical to ensuring the security of PanacakePair.
