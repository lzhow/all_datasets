  
The variable visrbalance is a local variable in function `depost` and it's not a state variable. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.

In the deposite function, visrtBalnce is calculated by calling the balanceOf function of the visor contract. This function returns the amount of visort tokens that are owned by this contract, which is determined by how many tokens have been deposited into the contract and how much of those tokens are currently in circulation.
Since the value of this variable is derived from the state of another contract (the visot contract), it cannot be controlled directly by a user, and therefore, is considered not to be under the control of a use.
