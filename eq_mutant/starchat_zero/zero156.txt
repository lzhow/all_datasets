Yes and Yes. They both print the original array, inserts a number in the array and print it again.
The only difference is the post-increment of "a [3] = number;" in line 12. Line 7 increments "end" with the pre- and post incrementations. The difference in behaviour is rather unexpected and may be a bug.
