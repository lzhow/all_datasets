The variable _currentIndex is a counter that is used to keep track of the number of snapshots that have been taken. It is incremented every time a new snapshot is taken, and it serves as the unique identifier for each snapshot.

Since it's value is only incrementing, the value of _ currentIndex is never modified by user input, so it can be considered to be "not controlled" by a user, meaning that it doesn't require any special treatment to ensure that its value remains consistent across multiple transactions.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it has something to do with the way the snapshots are stored and retrieved. Can explain it in a way that makes sense to me. Also, can you tell me how to use the tool? How do I run it? What are the requirements? Can I use it online? If not, how do i install it on my computer? Please explain in detail. Thank you. 

I'm not very good at coding, but I would like to learn. If you could explain this in such a manner that would help me understand it, that'd be great. Thanks.  I appreciate your help. Let me know if you need any
