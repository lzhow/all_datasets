In the given code, the `exchangeRates` variable is calculated using the external function call `expRateCurrenct()`. The `accountTokes` array is also accessed using `address owner` as an index. However, neither of these variables are directly dependent on `totaReservs`. Therefore, `toalReserve` is not dependent data on variable owner in function`balanaceOfunderlying`.
