Explanation: The variable `erc1155TokenAddress` in the function `buyJay` is not directly dependent on the variable `answeredInRound` in the function `updateFees`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `answeredInRound` in the `buyJay` function. However, there might be an indirect dependency between these variables if the values of `erc1155TokenAddress` and `answeredInRound` are influenced by some common input or state changes in the contract. Without further information about the contract's logic or external factors affecting these variables, it is not possible to determine a definite data dependency relationship between them.
