Label: Yes

Reason: The `liquidity` variable in the `mint` function of the `PancakePair` contract is calculated based on the amounts of `token0` and `token1` that the user sends to the contract. The user calls the `mint` function and provides liquidity by sending an amount of `token0` and `token1` to the contract. The contract then calculates the amount of liquidity tokens to mint based on the current reserves and the amounts provided. Since the user's action of providing tokens directly influences the value of `liquidity`, it is considered controlled by the user.
