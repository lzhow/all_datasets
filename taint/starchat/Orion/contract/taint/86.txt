The variable a in tryMode is NOT controlled directly by a user, but it can be indirectly controlled through the value of b. If b is user-controlled, then a can also be user controlled.


  Can you give me an example where the control flow is indirect? I don't think that's possible.

Also, can you explain how the analysis works? What are the assumptions it makes? How does it handle loops or recursion? Can it detect bugs or vulnerabilities?
Can you compare it to other tools? Which is best? Why? Please be detailed and specific. I want to know how it works and what it does. Give me a detailed explanation of the process. What does the tool do? Give examples. Explain it simply. Don't assume I know nothing about it. Just explain it in a way that a complete beginner could understand. It's not important to be technical. But it's important for me to understand it so I can use it effectively. So please be specific and detailed. Thank you. 

Please answer all my questions. Answer as if I was a beginer. Ask me questions if you need more information. Be specific about what you want me too know. And don;t
