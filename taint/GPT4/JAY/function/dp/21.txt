Explanation: The variable `total` in the function `buyNFTs` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyERC1155`. This is because the value of `total` is updated based on the return value of the `buyERC1155` function, which is determined by the `amounts` array. The `amounts` array is used to calculate the `total` value by adding up its elements in the `buyERC1155` function. Therefore, any changes in the `amounts` array will affect the value of `total`, indicating a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
