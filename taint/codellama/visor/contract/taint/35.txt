  
No, the `_ name` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a constant value that is passed as an argument to `ER2C` contract.

The `name_` parameter is a string that represents the name of the token, and it should be a valid Solidiy identifier. It is used to set the ` _ name ` variable, which is then used as the symbol of this token.  The ` name_ ` parameter should not be controlled directly by a user input, as it can be used for malicious purposes such as token stealing. Therefore, we can consider it as a non-user controlled variable.
