Reason: The contract state `reserve0` represents the reserve of token0 in the liquidity pool and is used to keep track of the liquidity available for token0. The variable `_token1` in the function `swap` represents the address of token1 in the liquidity pool. The `reserve0` state is updated based on the balance of token0 and is independent of the address or balance of token1. The function `swap` uses `reserve0` to check the liquidity before performing a swap and to update the reserves after the swap, but the value of `reserve0` is not directly computed from or changed based on the value of `_token1`. The update of `reserve0` is based on the balance of token0 (`balance0`) and not on the balance or address of token1 (`_token1`). Therefore, `reserve0` and `_token1` do not have a data dependency relationship.
