The contract has a function called `_removeFromPartitions`. This function removes a token from all partitions.

`_removePartitionsFromAll` is called in two places:
1. In the `transfer` function, when transferring tokens from one address to another. This is done by calling `_callTransferFrom` with `_from` as the first parameter. `_addFromToPartitions`, which is also called by `_calTransfer`, adds the tokens to the `_to` address in all of the partitions that the sender has.

2. When the token is minted, by the internal `_mint` method. It adds them to all the default partitions, which are the only partitions in which they can be held.
