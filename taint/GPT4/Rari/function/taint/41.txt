The variable `newAccrued` in the function `updateContributorRewards` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `newAccrued` is calculated based on the difference between the current block number and the last block number stored for the contributor. The calculation is performed within the contract and does not depend on any user input. Therefore, the variable `newAccrued` is not controlled by the user.
