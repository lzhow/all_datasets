In the constructor function, the `_total_supply` variable is initialized to  `0` and the `default_partition` is added to the total partitions.
Then, `ERc1_8_2_0client.SetInterface_Implemenation` function is called to set the implementation of the AMP_Interface and ERc2O_interface.  The `swap_token` address is passed as an argument to this function. Therefore, `_ swap_Token_Address` has a dependency on `_ balances`.
