  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `require` statement in `funcionStaticcall` checks if the target address is a contract address. If it is not, it throws an error.
Then, in `_verifycallResult`, the success variable is set to the return value of the staticcall function, which is dependent on `data` and `errorMessage`.
Therefore, `sucess` is data-dependent on both `targer`and `dat`.
