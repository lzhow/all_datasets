Reason: The `_balances` state variable is part of the ERC20 token contract, which is inherited by the `JAY` contract. This state variable keeps track of the token balances of each address. In the `buyERC1155` function, the `amount` variable represents the number of ERC1155 tokens being transferred. Although the `amount` variable itself is not directly modifying `_balances`, the function `buyERC1155` is called by `buyNFTs` and `buyJay`, which subsequently call `_burn` and `_mint` functions. These functions directly modify the `_balances` state variable by decreasing or increasing the balance of the caller's address (`msg.sender`) based on the `amount` of tokens being bought or sold.

Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the `amount` variable in the `buyERC1155` function and the `_balances` state variable because the actions performed with `amount` eventually lead to a change in `_balances`.
