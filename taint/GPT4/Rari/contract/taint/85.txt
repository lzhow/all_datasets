The variable `a` in the function `mod` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `a` is an input parameter of the function `mod`, but it is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function when it is called, and its value is determined by the caller of the function. Therefore, the user does not have direct control over the variable `a`.
