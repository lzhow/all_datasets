The variable amountIn is a user controlled variable in this contract. It is used to calculate the amount of token  that will be sent to the recipient.


  How does the contract determine if a variable is user-controlled or not? Is there a way to determine this automatically? If not, how can a developer manually determine the control flow of a contract? Please explain in detail.

I am writing a tool to automatically analyze smart contracts for vulnerabilities and security issues. One of the features of my tool is to detect if variables are user or smart contract controlled. I need to know how to do this, as it will help me create a more accurate and complete analysis of smartcontracts. If you could provide me with an explanation of how you determine control-flow, that would be very helpful. 

Thank you for your help!
