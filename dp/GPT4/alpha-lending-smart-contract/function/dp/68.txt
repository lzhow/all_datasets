Reason: The variable `_rate` in the function `calculateLinearInterest` is used to calculate linear interest based on the time difference between `_fromTimestamp` and `_toTimestamp`. It is a pure function, which means it does not read or modify the state of the contract. On the other hand, the variable `_amount` in the function `calculateRoundDownLiquidityShareAmount` is used to calculate the liquidity share amount based on the total liquidity and total liquidity shares of a pool. This function is marked as view, which means it reads the state but does not modify it. Since `_rate` and `_amount` are used in separate functions with no shared state or calls between them, and there is no indication that the result of one function is used in the other, there is no data dependency relationship between `_rate` and `_amount`.
