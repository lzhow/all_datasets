Reason: The variables with the suffix `_TYPEHASH` (e.g., `ACCOUNT_SIGNATURE_TYPEHASH`, `PROTOCOL_FEE_SIGNATURE_TYPEHASH`, etc.) are internal constants within the contract. They are computed at compile time using the `keccak256` hash function on a set of predetermined strings that represent the structure of various data types used in the contract. Since these are constants, their values are fixed and cannot be altered during the execution of the contract. Therefore, they are not controlled by the user.
