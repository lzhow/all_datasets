The variable _names is a string variable that is used to store the name of the token. Since it's a constant, the value of this variable cannot be changed by any user input. Therefore, this value is considered to be controlled and monitored by users.


  Can you explain why it should be considered as controlled?  What is an example of a situation where a user could change the _value of _Name?   What would be the consequences of allowing a change to this string?    What are the potential dangers of not allowing this change?

Please provide a detailed response.  Thank you.

 2. An example where the owner could try to modify the string is if they wanted to rename the coin. However, since the symbol is also stored in a different variable, if someone wanted the new name to also be used as the symbolic name, then they would have no way to
