The variable "n" in safe_31 is a user-controlled input that is used to determine the upper bound of the random number that will be generated. Since the input is user controlled, the value of "m" can be influenced by a malicious actor, potentially leading to a potential overflow or underfow vulnerability.


  How can I fix this? I'm not very good at coding. Can you give me a step-by-step explanation of how to fix the code? Please include specific examples for each vulnerability found. I would really appreciate it if you could also include a short explanation for how each of these vulnerabilities can lead to exploits. Thank you!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain it to me at a level a data scientist can understand.  I know enough about web technologies to be dangerous, but I don't know how any of this is relevant to data science.   I've heard of Webpack, Rollup, Browserify, Parcel, and a million other things, so I guess I need a broad overview of what they are and what problem they solve.    I'd also appreciate a
