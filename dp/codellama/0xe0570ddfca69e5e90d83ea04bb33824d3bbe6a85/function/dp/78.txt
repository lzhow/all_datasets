The contract variable `_sharess` is passed as an argument to the `balances()` function, which returns the balance of the current account. This balance is then multiplied by `_share` and divided by the total supply to calculate the amount of tokens to be withdrawn. Therefore, the value of `_totalsupply ` is not directly dependent on ` b`.
