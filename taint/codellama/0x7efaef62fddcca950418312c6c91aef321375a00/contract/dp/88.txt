  
No, the variables `_ reserve ​​1 `and` balance  `are not dependent on each other in function` _ mintF  `.

The reason is that the`_reserver1  'variable is defined as a local variable in` mint  ', and it is not modified in any way. Therefore, it does not depend on any other variable, including`balan  ce1`.
On the other hand,` balan ce  `'s value is calculated based on` I ERC  '.balanc eOf (addres s (this))  , which is a function call that returns a value that depends on external factors such as the current balance of the contract.
Therefore, while`reserv  e1 'and' balanc  are related in that they both represent the balance in a particular token at a given point in time, their values are independent of each and cannot be considered data-dependent.
