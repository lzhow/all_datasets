Label: no

Reason: In the provided Solidity code, there are two overloaded functions named `recover`. The first `recover` function takes a `bytes32 hash` and a `bytes memory signature` as arguments, and it extracts the `r`, `s`, and `v` components from the `signature`. The second `recover` function takes a `bytes32 hash`, a `uint8 v`, a `bytes32 r`, and a `bytes32 s` as arguments.

The variable `s` in the second `recover` function is an argument passed directly to the function and is used to compute the `address signer` using the `ecrecover` function. The variable `v` is also an argument to the same function and is used in the `ecrecover` function as well as in a `require` statement to validate its value.

However, there is no direct data dependency between `s` and `v` within the second `recover` function. The value of `s` does not depend on the value of `v`, nor does the value of `v` depend on the value of `s`. They are independent parameters that are both used in the `ecrecover` function to recover the signer's address, but their values are not derived from one another within the scope of this function. Therefore, `s` is not data dependent on `v` in the context of the second `recover` function.
