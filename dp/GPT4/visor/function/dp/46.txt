The variable `signer` in the function `permit` is data dependent on the variable `s` because `signer` is the result of the `ECDSA.recover` function, which takes the `hash`, `v`, `r`, and `s` as arguments. The `s` variable is part of the signature components (along with `v` and `r`) used to recover the address of the signer. If `s` were to change, it would potentially result in a different address being recovered by the `ECDSA.recover` function, thus affecting the value of `signer`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `signer` and `s`.
