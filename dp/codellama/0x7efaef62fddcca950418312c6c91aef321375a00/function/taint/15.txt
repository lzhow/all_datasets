  
No, the ` price ​​0 cumulative last` variable in function `m int` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the current state of the contract and the previous state, and it does not depend on any user input.

The reason for this is that the value of `reserves0` and ` reserves1` are obtained from the external calls to the ERC-2 tokens, which are not under the control of any single user and are determined by market forces. Therefore, `total supply` can be calculated using the formula `sqrt (reserver0 * reservoir1)`, which is a deterministic function that does depend only on external inputs.
