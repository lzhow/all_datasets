Explanation: The variable `kink_` in the function constructor is not controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the constructor function when the contract is deployed. The value of `kink_` is determined by the deployer of the contract and cannot be changed by any external user once the contract is deployed. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
