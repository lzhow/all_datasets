  
The variable `mintAmount` in function ` mintAllowe` is a parameter of the external function. It is passed as an argument to the `enterMarkers` function, which is called within the body of ` mingAllow` . Therefore, the value of this variable is determined by an external user and is therefore controlled.

Therefore, we label this as 'Yes'.
