Label: no

Reason: The variable `_partition` in the function `allowanceByPartition` is an input parameter that specifies the partition from which the allowance is being queried. It is used to access the mapping `_allowedByPartition` to retrieve the allowance amount for a specific owner and spender within that partition.

On the other hand, the variable `_operatorData` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` is also an input parameter, but it is used to pass additional data to token recipient contracts implementing the `IAmpTokensRecipient` interface. This data is typically used for validation or to trigger additional logic in the recipient contract when tokens are received.

There is no direct relationship or dependency between `_partition` and `_operatorData` within the given code. The `_partition` variable is used for querying allowances, while `_operatorData` is used for passing data during token transfers. They operate in different contexts and are not used together in a way that would create a data dependency.
