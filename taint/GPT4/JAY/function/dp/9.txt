Label: unknown

Reason: The contract state `nftsBought` is not directly dependent on the variable `erc721TokenAddress` in the function `buyNFTs`. The variable `erc721TokenAddress` is used as an input parameter for the `buyERC721` function, but the result of this function does not directly affect the value of `nftsBought`. Therefore, there is no clear data dependency relationship between `nftsBought` and `erc721TokenAddress` based on the provided code snippet.
