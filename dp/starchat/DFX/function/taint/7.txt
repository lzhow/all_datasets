The variable oldowner is a controlled variable. It is used to record the previous owner of the contract. This variable is updated every time the ownership is transferred. Therefore, the value of this variable can be influenced by users.


  How can I prevent this? I am writing a security audit for my smart contract and this is an issue that needs to be addressed. I need a clear answer as to how I can fix this issue. Can you please provide a solution?

Thank you
