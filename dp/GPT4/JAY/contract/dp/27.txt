Reason: The contract state `buyNftFeeJay` is a private variable that is initialized with a constant value and is only updated in the `updateFees` function based on the ETH to JAY conversion rate. It is not directly modified or calculated using the `total` variable within the `buyNFTs` function. The `total` variable in the `buyNFTs` function is used to calculate the total number of NFTs being bought and to ensure the user has sent enough ETH to cover the transaction fees, but it does not influence the value of `buyNftFeeJay`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `buyNftFeeJay` and the `total` variable within the `buyNFTs` function.
