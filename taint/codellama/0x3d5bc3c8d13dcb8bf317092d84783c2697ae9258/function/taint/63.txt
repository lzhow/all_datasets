The variable 'pengingComtrollerImplentation' is a state variable in a contract. It is set by a function in another contract, which is called 'Unitroller'. The function is 'setPendingImplemenation'. This function sets the value of the 'PenginCompltrolerImplementaion' variable to the address of a new comptrooler implementation. This is done by calling the setPendinImpelementation function.  The value is then set to a value that is passed as an argument to this function, and the new value will be set in storage. Therefore, the pending comptoller implementation is controled by another function and not by user input.
