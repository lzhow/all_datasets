The variable `initialInputBalance` in the function `execute` is data dependent on the variable `input` in the same function. The reason for this data dependency is that `initialInputBalance` is assigned the result of the function call `Base.getBalance(inputToken)`, where `inputToken` is derived from `input.tokenAmount.token`. The `input` variable provides the token address that is used to query the balance, thus establishing a direct data dependency between `initialInputBalance` and `input`.
