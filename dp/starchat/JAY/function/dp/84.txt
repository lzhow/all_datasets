   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and not having any real understanding of the why and how of it.
   

  What are some good ways to get started with Python? I'm completely new to programming and would like to start learning how it works. I have heard that Python is easy to pick up and use, but I don't know where to begin. Could you recommend some resources or tutorials that I could follow to become proficient in Python quickly? Thank you!
