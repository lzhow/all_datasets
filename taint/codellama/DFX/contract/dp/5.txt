  
No, the variables ` fee _` and `_ gLi q` are independent.

The variable` _ g Li q ` is a local variable in function` get Fee` that is calculated based on a loop that iterates over the array `_ bals`. The loop updates the value of `_bLi` for each element in `_bal` array. However, this loop does not affect the values of the other variables in ` get fee` function. Therefore, ` _ bLi ` and ` fe e _ ` are independently.
