  
No, the ` MIMIMUN_ LIQIDITY ` variable in function ` mint ` is NOT controlled  by user, because it's a constant value that is set to  `  uint  public  constant  M INIMIUM _LI QUID I TY =  1  _  *   _  3  ;  `.

The reason is that the value of `MIMINUM LIQUIDIY` is determined by a mathematical expression that does not depend on any user input. Therefore, this variable is considered to be a fixed value and is therefore not considered controlled user-input.
