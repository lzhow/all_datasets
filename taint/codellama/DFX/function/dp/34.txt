  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `keccack245` function, the `_assets` and `_assetWeight` arrays are passed as arguments. These arrays contain the addresses of the assets and their weights, respectively.
When the curve is created, it is assigned a unique ID based on these arrays. This ID is calculated using the keckack function. Therefore, `CurverId ` is data-dependent on `_ baseCurreny` because it depends on its value.
