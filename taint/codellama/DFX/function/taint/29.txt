  
No, the ` n GLi q_ ` variable in function ` get Origin Sw ap Data ` is NOT controlled  by user .

The `getOrigin Sw a p Data` function is a private function that is called by other functions in this contract. It is used to calculate the amount of liquidity that will be transferred from the origin assimilater to the target assimalater during a swap.
  The ` _ n G Liq _ `  variable is calculated by adding the balances of all the assimlators in ` curve . assets ` array, except for the input assimulator. This means that the value of ` ` N G L iq ` will depend on the values of the other assimilers in  the curve , but not on any user input. Therefore, `N G  L  i q _` is uncontrolled by a user and is considered a constant.
