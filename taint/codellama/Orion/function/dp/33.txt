  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `pair` variable is assigned the value of `IOrinPoolvV1Pair` which is a function call to `OrinoMultiPollLibrary`. The `input` and `output` variables are also assigned values in this function.
Later in line 3, `token0` is calculated by calling `sortToken` function on `inout`and `outout`.
Then in lines 4-6,`amountout`, `reserver0`, and`reserv1` are calculated.  `amountin`is calculated in a similar way. `getamountouut`function is called to calculate `amoutOut`.  The`to `variable is then assigned a value in `line 8`.   The function ends in`line10`. In the second function the same variables and functions are used. However, in function  `_ swap` the`curfactory`variable has a different value. Therefore, it is data-dependent.
