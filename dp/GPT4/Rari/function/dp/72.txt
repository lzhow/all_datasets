Explanation: 

The variable `simpleInterestFactor` in the function `finishInterestAccrual` is calculated using the `borrowRateMantissa` parameter, which is an input to the function. However, it is not clear whether the variable `simpleInterestFactor` is used or dependent on the variable in the function `getCashPrior` as the code snippet provided does not show any direct relationship between these two variables. Therefore, the data dependency relationship between `simpleInterestFactor` and the variable in the function `getCashPrior` is unknown.
