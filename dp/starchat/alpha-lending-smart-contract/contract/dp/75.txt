   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but Python seems very different. Plus, I heard it's used in some really complicated programs. So, what do I need to know? How much time should it take me to become good at it? And should I start with a lot of tutorials or just one or two good ones? I know this is really hard to answer, because there's no right answer. Everyone has their own learning style and way of doing things. But, if you could give me some general tips, that would be really helpful!

I've heard Python is used for machine learning, data analysis, web development,
