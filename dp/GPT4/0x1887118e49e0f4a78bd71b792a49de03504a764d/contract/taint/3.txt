Label: yes

Reason: The variable `underlyings` in the function `add` is an input parameter that is provided by the caller of the function. Since the function is external and does not have any restrictions on who can call it other than the `onlyAdmin` modifier, any user who has the ability to become the admin (by whatever means the contract allows for admin transfer) can control the contents of the `underlyings` array when calling this function. However, it's important to note that in the current context, only the admin can call this function due to the `onlyAdmin` modifier, but the admin is still a user from the perspective of the contract. Therefore, the variable `underlyings` is controlled by the user, specifically the admin user.
