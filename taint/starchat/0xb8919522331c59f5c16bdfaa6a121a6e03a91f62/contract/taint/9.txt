The Solidty code provided is a library of functions and contracts that are used to create and manage a proxy contract. A proxy is an intermediate contract that acts as a middleman between a user and a real contract, allowing the latter to be modified and upgraded by its owner.

In the provided code, the `TransparentUpgradable` contract is derived from the Proxy contract and is used as the base contract for the proxy that is deployed by a developer. This contract allows the developer to upgrade the contract implementation that the proxies points to. It also provides a mechanism for upgrading the implementation of the proxied contract in a secure way, by first upgrading it to a new contract address, and only then calling the new address with the original call data.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "controlled by user". Could you please explain what that means? Is there a particular function or variable that you are referring to? If so, please provide more context or information so that I can better understand your question. Thank you. 

I'm also happy to provide additional information or guidance if you need it. I just want to make sure I fully understand the question before providing a response. Let me know if there's anything
