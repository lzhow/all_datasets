No, the variable `amount0Out` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `path`. 

The variable `amount0Out` is assigned a value based on the condition `input == token0`. It is not directly influenced by the `path` variable. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
