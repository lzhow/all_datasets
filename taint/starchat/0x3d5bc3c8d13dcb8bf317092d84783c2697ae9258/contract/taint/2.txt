The variable ctoken is a contract address that is passed as an argument to the borrow allowed function. It is therefore controlled indirectly by users who call the BorrowAllowed function, as the address of the c token is provided by them.


  How do I know if a variable is "controlled" by a user or not? I'm not very good at math, and I don't know what "control" even means. Can you explain it to me like I have five years of high school math experience? Please provide examples too. I want to understand this concept so I can better understand how to use the tool you've created. Thanks!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.  How about a "static bundlers" like Webpack or Rollup? Why might you choose one over the other?  Expound on the "trade-offs" involved in choosing between them, such as build times, bundle sizes, etc.   What are some good use cases for each? Provide some examples. Finally, how do you make a choice of which bundling tool to adopt for your own
