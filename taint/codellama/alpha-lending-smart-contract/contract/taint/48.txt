  
No, the ` utilisationRate ` variable in function `calculateInterestsRate()` is NOT controlled  by user because it's calculated by dividing the total borrows by total liquidity.

The `total borrws` and ` totalL liquidty` are both controlled and modified by users. However, `Utilisation rate` is calculated based on these two variables and is therefore not directly controlled or modified
