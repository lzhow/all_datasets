The variable data in function `decode_i63` is user controlled.

This is because the `Obis` library is designed to be used in conjunction with a user interface that allows users to enter data into the smart contract. In this case, the data is entered by a human user and is therefore considered user-controlled.


  How can I make sure that the input data to the contract is sanitized and free of malicious intent? I want to make my contract as secure as possible. Can you give me some tips on how to do that?
Can you also give an example of how I could implement those tips in my smart contracts? Please provide code examples for Solidty and JavaScript. I am using Remix IDE. Thank you. 





   What is a good way to learn how a new language?  I have been wanting to get fluent in Spanish, but I don't want it to take too long.   I've only recently started learning howto read and write, so I still have a lot to figure out.    I was thinking of starting with an online course, since I heard that they are usually very good. Do you have any suggestions for a language course
