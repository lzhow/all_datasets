Reason: The variable `exchangeRate` in the function `exchangeRateStoredInternal` is calculated within that function using the variables `_totalSupply`, `totalCash`, `totalBorrows`, and `totalReserves`. It does not rely on any external input or state changes that occur outside of its scope. On the other hand, the variable `borrowAmount` in the function `borrowInternal` is a parameter that is passed into the function when it is called and is used within that function's scope to determine how much to borrow.

There is no direct interaction or data flow between `exchangeRate` and `borrowAmount` as shown in the provided code snippet. `exchangeRate` is derived from the contract's state and the result of internal calculations, while `borrowAmount` is an input parameter for a different function that does not affect the state variables used to calculate `exchangeRate`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
