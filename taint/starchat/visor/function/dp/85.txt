The function `totalSuppyAt` is a view function that returns the total supply of the token at a given snapshot ID. It first checks if the snapshot exists, and if it does, it returns its value. If the snapshots do not exist, the value is retrieved from the `TotalSuply` variable.

In the `_BeforeTokenTransfser` function, we have two cases to consider:
1. When the from address is equal to 0, this means that the tokens are being minted, so we need to update the account snapshot and the Total Supply snapshot.

2. Similarly, when the to address equals  to zero, tokens have been burned and we must update both the accounts snapshot, as well as the supply snapshot
3. In all other cases, both accounts need an updated snapshot
