If it can't be done, then why not, and if not why can it not be?

I'm trying to build a tool that can help me identify places where I can make my smart contracts more secure.  I want to be able to do this automatically, so I need a reliable way of determining if something is controllably by a human user or not.

If there are some cases where it would not work, please give me examples.    I'm sure there must be some, since this is
