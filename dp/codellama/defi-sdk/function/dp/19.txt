  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `calldTarget ` variable is assigned the value of the fourth element of a tuple that is decoded from the input ` callerCalldData `, which is a `bytes` type. Therefore, ` calltarget ` is data-dependent on ` callderCalldata `.
Similarly, in function two, variable call target is also assigned a value from a decoding of ` calledCallata `.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on their respective `calledCalladata` variables.
