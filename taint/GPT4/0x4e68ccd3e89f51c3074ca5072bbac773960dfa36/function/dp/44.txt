Label: yes

Reason: The variable `next` in the function `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord` is calculated using the variable `tickSpacing` in several places within the function. Specifically, `next` is assigned a value that is the product of `compressed` (or `compressed` with some additions or subtractions) and `tickSpacing`. This direct use of `tickSpacing` in the calculation of `next` establishes a data dependency relationship between the two variables. Therefore, any change in the value of `tickSpacing` would affect the calculated value of `next`.
