Label: no

Reason: In the given Solidity code, the variable `b` in the function `mul` and the variable `a` in the function `mod` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. There is no data dependency between them because each function has its own local scope, and the variables are not modified by any external state or shared between functions. The value of `b` in `mul` is independent of the value of `a` in `mod`. Each function call would pass its own arguments, and there's no interaction or dependency between these two variables across the functions.
