Explanation: 

Based on the provided code, it is not possible to determine if the variable `reserve1` in the function `_swap` is data dependent on the variable `path` in the same function. The code snippet does not show any direct assignment or usage of `path` to calculate or modify the value of `reserve1`. Therefore, without additional information or code context, it is not possible to determine the data dependency relationship between these two variables.
