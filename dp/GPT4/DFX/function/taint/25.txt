The variable `nGLiq_` in the function `viewTargetSwapData` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `nGLiq_` is calculated based on the values of `curve.assets` and `_length`, which are internal variables of the contract. The user does not have direct control over these variables, so the value of `nGLiq_` is not controlled by the user.
