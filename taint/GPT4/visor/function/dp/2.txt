yes

The variable `structHash` is data dependent on the variable `deadline` because `structHash` is calculated using `keccak256` which takes `deadline` as one of its inputs within the `abi.encode` function. The `abi.encode` function serializes its arguments into a single bytes sequence, and since `deadline` is one of the arguments, any change in `deadline` would result in a different `structHash`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `structHash` and `deadline`.
