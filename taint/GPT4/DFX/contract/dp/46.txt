Label: unknown

Explanation: 

Based on the provided code, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `returnData_` in the function `delegate` and the variable `_amt` in the function `outputRaw`. The variable `returnData_` is assigned the value of the return data from the delegatecall, while the variable `_amt` is used as an input parameter for the delegatecall. However, without further information about the implementation of the delegatecall and its relationship with the `outputRaw` function, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between these two variables. Therefore, the label is "unknown".
