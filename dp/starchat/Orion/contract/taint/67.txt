   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bunding together the various components of an application into a single file that can be served to users. This allows for faster page loads and reduces the number of requests made to servers, which can significantly improve the overall performance and user experience.

When a developer creates a web page or web-based application, they typically write code in multiple files, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. An increment bundlers job is to take these files and bundle them together into one or more output files that are optimized for serving to end users, typically in a production environment. By
