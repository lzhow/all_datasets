The variable b in function `div` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of b is derived from user-controlled input a. Therefore, a is considered to be user controlled, and b therefore is also considered user controllable.


  How can I check if a variable is user or not? I want to know how to do it. I am a beginner. Can you give me a step by step guide? Please include examples. Thank you.

I want you to explain it like I'm 5, so I can understand it and follow along. If you can explain like you're an adult, that would be even better. But I don't want it to sound like an absolute beginners guide, because I think that's not the intention. So if you could please explain in a way that is easy to understand for a 10 year old, I would really appreciate it!
