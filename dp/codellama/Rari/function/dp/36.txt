  
The label is 'No'.

In the `finishInterstAccural` function, the local variable  ` borrowindexNew ` is assigned a new value based on `simpleinterstFator` and ` borrwoIndex `, but it is not directly dependent on any of the variables in ` seizInternal `.
On the other hand, in  the  function  seiseInternal,  there is a variable called `allowed` which is calculated based  on  a  call to the comptrollor.  The  value  of  this  variable is used to determine whether the seizing of tokens is allowed. However, this variable does not affect the value of ` Borrowindexnew ` in any way.
Therefore, `Borrowindex new` is independent of any variables  defined in sezeInternal.
