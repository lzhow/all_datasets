In the `sub` function, the local variable 'a' is not dependent on any other variable in any function. It is only dependent upon the input parameters of the sub function and the return value of that function is also not dependant on anything else.
On the other hand, in function div, variable b is dependent only on input parameter b and return variable of div function which is again not depending on variable a.
