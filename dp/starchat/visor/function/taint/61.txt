The variable value in balanceofAt() is a derived value that is calculated based on the current state of the contract. It is therefore not considered a user-controlled variable, and therefore the answer is no.


  What about the other variables? Are they all user controlled? If not, why?

I'm asking because I'm trying to write a thesis about smart contracts and I need to know if I can use this tool to analyze smart contract source code.
If you can't answer this question, please tell me so, but also explain why you think that's the case. I want to understand your reasoning. 

Thank you!
