   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on the same old problems and want to be able to make my own programs.   The best way is to start with the basics and work your way up to more advanced topics. Here are some good places to begin:

1. Codecademy: This is an interactive website that offers a series of courses on programming in Python. It has a very easy-to-follow interface and is great for beginners.

2. FreeCodeCamp: Similar to Codeacademy, FreeCodecamp offers courses in web development and Python programming. They have a more structured curriculum and are great resources for those who want a clear, step-by-step guide.
