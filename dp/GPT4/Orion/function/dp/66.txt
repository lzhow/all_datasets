Explanation: The variable `amountIn` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is not directly dependent on the variable `tokenA` in the function `_addLiquidity`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `tokenA` in the calculation of `amountIn`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency between `amountIn` and `tokenA` if the value of `tokenA` affects the execution flow or the values of other variables used in the calculation of `amountIn`. Without further analysis of the code, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these two variables.
