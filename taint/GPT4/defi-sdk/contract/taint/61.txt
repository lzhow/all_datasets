The variable `token` in the function `handleTokenInput` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since the function is internal and can be called by other functions within the contract, it is not directly exposed to external calls. However, the value of `token` is ultimately determined by the caller of the public or external functions that eventually call `handleTokenInput`. In the provided code, the `execute` function, which is external and can be called by anyone, takes an `Input` struct as an argument, which includes a `TokenAmount` struct that contains the `token` address. This means that the user who calls `execute` can specify the `token` address, which is then passed down to `handleTokenInput`. Therefore, the `token` variable is controlled by the user.
