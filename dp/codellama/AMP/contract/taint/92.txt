  
The variable `_operator` in function `isOperater` is a parameter of the method, which means that it can be controlled directly by a user of this contract. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.

In this function, `_isoperator()` is called with `_tokenholder` and `_operater`, and the result of that call is returned. `_authorizeoperatorbypartition()` and ` _revokeoperatorbypartition()` are also called in this method.
