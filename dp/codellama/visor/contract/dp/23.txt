In the ` deposits` function, the value of ` shares` is calculated as follows:
`sharesshares = deposittotalSupplieshare`
where `total Supply`is the total supply of the vVisr token, and `share` represents the fraction of each deposited token that is allocated to the recipient.
This calculation depends on ` total Supplies` because it is used to calculate the amount of vVIsr tokens that should be minted for each recipients. Therefore, ` sharestotal Suppliessharess` has a dependency on` totalSuppliestotalsupplies`.
