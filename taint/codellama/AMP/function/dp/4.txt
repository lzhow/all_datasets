In the given code, the `_transfereByParition` function is called, which is a function that transfers tokens from one address to another. This function takes in several parameters, including `_partition`, `_from`,`_to`, and `_operatordata`. The `_to` parameter is an address that represents the recipient of the tokens, and the` _balance` variable is used to store the balance of tokens for each address.
  The`transfeByPArtition ` function also takes an input parameter `_ value`, which represents  the amount of token to be transferred.  This parameter affects the value of `_ balance` because it is subtracted from the sender's balance and added to the receiver' s balance. Therefore, `_ balances ` is data-dependent on `_ values` .
