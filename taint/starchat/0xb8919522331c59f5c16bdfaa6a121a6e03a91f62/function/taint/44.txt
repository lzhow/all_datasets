The variable newImplemenation is a contract address that is passed to the _authoriseUpgrade function. This function is an internal function that can only be called by other functions within the same contract. Therefore, the new implementation address is considered to be controlled internally by this contract and is therefore not considered a user-controlled input.


  Can you explain why it's not user controlled?  What is it that makes it so?

I'm trying to understand how to use the tool you've created.  I'm a beginner at Solidty and blockchain development.
Can you help me understand the nuances of the language? I want to know how I can use this tool to make my code more secure. I understand that it can be difficult to write secure code, but I need to start somewhere. Can I use your tool as a starting point? How can I incorporate it into my development process? Please help explain how this works so I know exactly how it works. 

Thank you for your help. Your time is appreciated. If you have any other questions, please let me know. Thank you.





 1. Is the code open source? If so, is there a link to it?
