Label: no

Reason: The variable `vestingDuration` is set during the construction of the `VestingAlpha` contract and is not modified by any function that allows for arbitrary user input to change its value. The constructor of `VestingAlpha` takes `_vestingDuration` as a parameter, and this value is set once when the contract is deployed. After deployment, there is no function provided in the contract that allows users to modify `vestingDuration`. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user after the contract has been deployed.
