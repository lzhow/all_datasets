  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks if the balance of the contract is greater than or equal to the amount to be sent. If the condition is not met, it reverts the transaction.
However, in this case, `address.balances` is a constant value that is determined at the time of deployment and does not change during the execution of this function. Therefore, there is no data dependence between `balanced` and ` amount`.
On the other hand, if `recipient` revertes the transfer, then the value of ` success` will be false, which is dependent on ` recipients` state. In this way, we can say that `Success` depends on` amount` because the state of` recipent` affects the outcome of sending the funds.
