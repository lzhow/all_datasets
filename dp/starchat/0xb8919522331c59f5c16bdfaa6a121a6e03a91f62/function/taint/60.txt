The variable _ROLLBAK_SLOT is a constant in Solidty and is used to store the location of the rollback function in a proxy contract. As such, the value of this variable is determined by Solidit and cannot be changed by users. Therefore, this value is considered to be controlled internally by Smart contract developers and not by end users, and therefore the answer is 'No'.


  Can you explain to me how the EVM works? I know it's a stack-based virtual machine, but I don't know how exactly the stack is implemented.
 
  The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is an abstract machine that executes smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to run smart contract bytecode, which is compiled from high-level programming languages like Solidy.

At a high level, an Etheruem node executes the smart contrac bytecode by following a set of rules that define how data is stored and manipulated. These rules are defined in Ethereum's yellow paper, a technical specification that is maintained by Ethereum Foundation. 

One of Ethereueum's key features is that it uses a Turing-complete virtual machiune, meaning that
