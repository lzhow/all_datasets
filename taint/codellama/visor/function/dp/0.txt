Explanation:
In the first function, the `sub` function is called on `token` with `address (this)` and `value` as arguments. This function returns a new allowances value that is equal to the original allowence minus the value.

So, `NewAllowances` is data-dependent on both ` address ( this)`  and  ` value`.
