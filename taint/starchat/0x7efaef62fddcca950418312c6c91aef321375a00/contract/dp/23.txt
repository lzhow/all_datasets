   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  
   An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web pages by combining multiple files into a single file. This reduces the number of requests made to the server, which improves the page load time. Some popular incremental bundle tools for JavaScript include Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel.js.

Webpack is widely used in web development and is considered an incremental and static bundlers. It can bundle together multiple file types, including JavaScript, CSS, images, HTML, etc. Webpack can optimize and minify the code, allowing for faster page loads. However, it can be difficult to set up and requires a bit of configuration. RollUp is another popular tool that can also bundle multiple JavaScript files. Unlike Webpack and other bundlers, rollup does not perform any optimizations or minifications. Parcel is also a popular bundller that is often used for bundlling web apps. Like Webpack it also supports multiple types of files, but it has a simpler configuration and does less optimization
