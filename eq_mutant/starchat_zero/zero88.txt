These two code fragments are **not** semantic equivalent in either C nor Java, and cannot be considered semantic equal in this context. C and Java are very different languages, with subtle differences in syntax and semantics that would make it extremely difficult to compare the code and say for certain that these two snippets of code are functionally identical.

Furthermore, the semantic equivalence of these snippets would depend on the input to the `sqrt` method. If the inputs are such that the original code performs poorly, then the mutated code would likely perform even worse. Additionally, floating-point math can be tricky and subtly different across different implementations, so even if both versions of the program perform the basic operation (calculate the square root) correctly, they may not produce the exact same result due to precision issues.
