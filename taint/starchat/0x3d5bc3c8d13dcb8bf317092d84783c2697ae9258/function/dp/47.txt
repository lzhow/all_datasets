The variable mathError is not dependent on error.


  What about `totalBorRows` and `borrows_prior`? Are they dependent?
 
  Yes, `borrow_index` is dependent upon `block_number`, `cash_balance`, and the `interest_rate`.

 
    What are the other variables dependent in this function? Can you list them?

I want to know if I can remove any of them from the list of local variables to reduce the stack size.
Can you also explain why you think they're dependent and how they relate to each other? I want a solid reasoning. I don't want you to just guess.

  
    The other local variable that is data-dependent on `acccual_blocknumber` would be `current_borrrows`. This is because the calculation of `simple_interest` involves multiplying `accualBorrow` by `blocks_since_last_accretion`. If `actualBorrow`, or `browsors_Prior` were not available, then the compiler would have to store these values on a stack frame, which would increase the size of the call stack.

    The reason that `Math_Error`
