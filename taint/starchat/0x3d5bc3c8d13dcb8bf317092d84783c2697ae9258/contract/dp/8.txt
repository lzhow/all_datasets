The function signature for `exitMarket` is:

`function exitMarkt(addres ctoken) public returns(uint)`
and the signature of `redeemVerify`is: 

function redemeVerify (address,address,uint, uint)external
So, the first parameter is `address` and the second is also `addrees`. This means that the two parameters are of the same type and have the potential to be the `same` variable.
However, looking at the body of both functions, it is not clear that these parameters could ever be `the same`variable.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to say that I want you to analyze this contract:
  ```
  pragma solidty 4.8.0;
  contract A {
    function f(bool x) internal pure returns () {
      if (x) {
        g(x);
      }
    }
  
    function g() internal {}
  }
  ````
  and determine if the variables `x` or `g` are used uninitialized.
  The answer should be "yes" for both variables. Explain why.
  
  Thank you.
  



  Yes, both `
