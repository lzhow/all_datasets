It contains information about the current message that was sent to the smart contract, including the sender and the value sent with the message. In the case of the update function, `lockdev`, `start`, and `nextFeeupdate` are all contract-level variables that are accessible to all the functions within the Jay contract and are therefore considered to be data-dependent on `_addres`.


  Can you explain how the code works?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain in detail how this code snippet works.

The Jaya token (Jaya) is an NFT-backed stablecoin that uses an oracle to determine the price of ether (ETH) in real-time. This allows users to purchase Jays by sending ether to a smart-contract, which then mints the corresponding number of Jaays in exchange. Users can also sell their Jaaays for ether, but they will be subject to an exchange rate fee.
