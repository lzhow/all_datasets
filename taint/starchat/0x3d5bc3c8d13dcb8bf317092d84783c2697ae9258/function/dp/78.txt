The contract variable totalReservse is not used in this function.

  The contract function "balanceOf" is using the state variables "accountBalances" and "exchangeRates". These variables are declared in contract line number 3 and 4 respectively. These state varibales are used to calculate the balance of the owner. Therefore, the variables accountBalance and exchange rates are dependent on each other. 

In the above code, we are calculating the "owner" balance by multiplying the account balance with the exchange rate. Since the two state vaiables are inter-dependent, it is safe to say that the code has a "data dependency" relationship between the varibles "acountBalance
