Label: no

Reason: The contract state `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT` is a constant string defined at the beginning of the contract and is used to represent an interface name for the ERC1820 registry. It is not modified anywhere in the contract and serves as an identifier for the tokens recipient interface. On the other hand, the variable `_fromPartition` is a parameter of the function `_callPreTransferHooks` and is used to determine the partition from which tokens are being transferred. There is no code in the function `_callPreTransferHooks` that creates a data dependency between `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT` and `_fromPartition`. The `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT` remains the same regardless of the value of `_fromPartition`, and `_fromPartition` does not influence the value of `AMP_TOKENS_RECIPIENT`. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
