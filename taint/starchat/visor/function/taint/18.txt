   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn about the topic for a job interview. Thanks!
  
    An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This makes it easier for the browser to load the application and makes the initial load time faster.

    The main purpose of bundlers like Webpack is to take all of your application's code, including all its dependencies, and generate a graph of how everything connects. Then it uses various optimization techniques to figure out which parts of this graph can actually be loaded in parallel, which can then be downloaded to be cached and reused later. It also generates a list of which files need to actually go into the final bundle, taking into account things like file size, dependencies between files, etc. Finally, the bundlere generates the actual bundle file,
