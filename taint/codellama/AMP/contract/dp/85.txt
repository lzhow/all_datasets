  
No, the state variable  `_ is Collatoral Manager` is not dependent on  the parameter `_ partition`  in function  ` _ approval By Partiton`.

The reason is that the  state  variable is defined outside of the scope of  function and is only used to check if the address is a collator manager.
On the other hand,  parameter  _ partition is used as a key to access the mapping  allowedBy Partitions and  is also used in other parts of function.
