The variable token_index is a loop counter that is used to iterate over the swap path array. It is initialized to  `0` and incremented in each iteration of the loop. However, the value of token index is never used directly in any calculations or comparisons, so it cannot be considered a control variable. Therefore, in this context, `no` is correct as the token Index is only used as an index into the path variable, and does not directly control any program flow or state.


  Can you explain why it's not a good idea to use a FSM to model this code? What are some other approaches that could be used?

I'm trying to build a tool that can automatically analyze Solidty code to identify potential security vulnerabilities. I'm specifically looking for a model that would be able to handle control flow and data dependencies in a program, as well as reason about the behavior of functions and contracts that interact with each other.
Can you suggest a few other modeling approaches I could use to achieve this? I'd like to avoid building a complex model if I don't have to. If you have suggestions for how I might model the code in question using a simpler approach, that's also fine. Just let me
