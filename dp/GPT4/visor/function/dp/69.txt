Label: no

Reason: In the provided Solidity code, the variable `data` is an input parameter to the function `functionStaticCall` and is used in the `staticcall` to the `target` address. The variable `success` is a boolean that is set as a result of the `staticcall` execution. The `data` variable is used to make the call, but it does not influence or get influenced by the `success` variable directly. The `success` variable's value is determined by the outcome of the `staticcall` and not by the `data` itself. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `data` and `success` within the `functionStaticCall` function.
