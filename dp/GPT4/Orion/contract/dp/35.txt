The variable `inputInd` in the function `_swapCurve` is derived from the function `ICurveRegistry(curFactory).get_coin_indices(pool, input, output)`, which takes the arguments `pool`, `input`, and `output`. The variable `path` is not directly used as an argument in this function. However, it is possible that the values of `input` and `output` are derived from the `path` array. Without further information about the relationship between `path` and the arguments of `get_coin_indices`, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between `inputInd` and `path`.
