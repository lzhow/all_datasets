  
The variable 'account' in function 'isContrac' is labeled as 'Unknown'.

This is because the 'address' type in Solidiy is a 160-bit value that represents an Ethereum address. It is generated by hashing the public key of an account. Therefore, the value of 'acount' cannot be controlled directly by a user, but rather it can be derived from the account's public address or private key.
