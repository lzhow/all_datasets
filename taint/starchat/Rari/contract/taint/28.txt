The variable deltaDrIp_ in function drIp is a result of the calculation dRiPtotal = drIrate * (blockNumber - drIStart), where dRipTotal is an unsigned integer, drIRate is uint, blocknumber is also uint and dRIPStart is set to block number when the contract is deployed.

As such, the value of deltaDRip_ is determined by user input and is therefore considered controlled.


  How can I prevent the users from changing the values of drpIRATE and blockNUMBER?  How do I make sure that the dRPtotal is always up to date? Can you give me an example of how to do this?
Can you also explain how the code works? I am not very good at coding. I have never written a line of code before. Can I just copy and paste this code into Remix and it will work? Or do i need to install something else? Please explain step by step. Thank you.  I would love to use this tool, but I don't want to break it. 

Please also answer my other question. Is the `token_` variable in dRp() is controled by users? If not, why do
