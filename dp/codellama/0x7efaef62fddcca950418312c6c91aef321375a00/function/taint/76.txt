The ` _ update ` function is called in ` mint ` and ` burn ` functions, and it updates the reserves of tokens.
It is important to note that the `_ update` function does not take any input from the outside world, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user, but it can be influenced by other factors such as the amount of liquidty minted or burned, or the price of each token in relation to the other.
