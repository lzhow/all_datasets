  
No, the variables ` sqratioAX 9 6 ` and `sqratiorBx9` are independent in function`getamount0delta`.

The reason is that the `muldiv` function in `Fullmath` library is used to calculate the value of `numerat0r1` and`numerato2`, which are used in calculating the final result. These variables are calculated independently of each other and are only used as inputs to the calculation of the result, which is not dependent on `SQRATIOB X9`. Therefore, ` SQRT RATI OAX` is independent of`S QRTR A TIO BX 8`.
