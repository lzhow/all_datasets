The variable becomeimplementationdata is a byte array that is passed to the implementation contract during the _becameImplementation call. It is intended to be used to pass data to a new implementation. However, the control flow of the smart contract makes it difficult to determine whether or not this variable is user-controlled.


  Can you explain how the flow control makes determining if a variable or state in a smart contracts is "user-controllable" difficult? Is it because the code has not been written with security in mind? Or is it due to limitations in static analysis tools? If the latter, what are some of these limitations? Can these be overcome?

I am writing a thesis on smart-contract security and am trying to understand the state of smartcontract analysis and how it can be improved. I would appreciate any insights you have on this topic.
Thank you





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. Also mention the pros and cons of using an incremental bundling approach in web development. What are the advantages? What potential
