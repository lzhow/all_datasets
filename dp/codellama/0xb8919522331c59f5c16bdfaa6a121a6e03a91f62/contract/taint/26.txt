  
No, the `` variable in function `_admin` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a private variable and it can only be accessed by internal functions.

The variable is declared as private, which means that it cannot be directly accessed from outside the contract. It can be only accessed through internal methods, such as `_getadmin()` and `_changeadmin()`.
Additionally, `_setadmin( )` function can also change the value of the `_ADMIn_` variable, but it requires the caller to have the `admin role`.
So, in summary, while the  `_admIn`  variable can  be changed by external users, they cannot directly access it.
