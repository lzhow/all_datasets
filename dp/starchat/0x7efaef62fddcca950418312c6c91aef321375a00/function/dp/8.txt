   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how. I have heard that python is easy, but I don't know where to start. What should I do? I've been trying to program for about a year now, and I feel like I'm really slowing down. Can you help me? Please. Thank you.

I am a college student who is trying hard to get a job in tech.  I took a computer science class in colleg and have been working on some personal projects,  but am struggling to find my footing as a developer. 

Please help. If you could just give me a few good first steps, that would be great. For example, "here's a website that has a bunch of free resources for learning python," or "take this class, it'll teach you everything you need to know."
