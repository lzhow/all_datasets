Label: yes

Reason: The variable `compoundedLiquidityBalance` in the function `getUserAccount` is obtained from the call to `getUserPoolData(_user, _token)`. The `_user` parameter passed to `getUserPoolData` is the same as the `_account` parameter in the function `claimCurrentAlphaReward`. This indicates that `compoundedLiquidityBalance` is calculated based on the user's data, which is represented by `_account` in `claimCurrentAlphaReward`. Since `getUserPoolData` likely retrieves or calculates data based on the user's interaction with the pool, which is associated with their account, there is a data dependency relationship between `compoundedLiquidityBalance` and `_account`. The actions performed in `claimCurrentAlphaReward` could potentially affect the user's pool data, which in turn would affect the `compoundedLiquidityBalance` retrieved in `getUserAccount`.
