Reason: The variable `name` in the `PancakeERC20` contract is declared as a public constant with the value 'Pancake LPs'. This means that its value is set at compile time and cannot be changed thereafter. Since it is a constant, it is not controlled by the user and cannot be modified by any function calls or transactions.
