Yes

The variable `_blockTimestampLast` in the function `getReserves` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve1` in the function `_update`. The reason for this is that both `_blockTimestampLast` and `_reserve1` are updated in the same function `_update` based on the current state of the contract. The `_update` function is responsible for updating the reserves and the timestamp after any liquidity is added or removed from the pool. The updated values of `_reserve0`, `_reserve1`, and `_blockTimestampLast` are stored in the contract's storage and represent the current state of the reserves and the last block timestamp when an update occurred. Since `_blockTimestampLast` is updated in the same transactional context as `_reserve1`, there is a direct data dependency between these two variables.
