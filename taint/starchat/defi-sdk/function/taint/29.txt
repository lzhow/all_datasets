The variable output in cancelAccounSignature() is user-controlled.

This is because the signature is generated by a user, and the input and output amounts are derived from user input (via the permit), so the output amount is also user controlled.


  How do I know if a variable is "user-controllable"?
 
  You can check if it's user controllable by looking at the code. If the value is set by an external source, then it can be controlled, otherwise it isn't. For example, if you have a function that takes a parameter and assigns it to a state variable, you can assume that the parameter is controllabe if and only if that state varible is. However, in some cases, the controled variable may be derived in a complex way from other variables, so it may not be clear if they are contorlable or not. In those cases you may need to do more analysis. It's also worth noting that in many cases the variables may have to be public in order to allow the contract to access them, which means that they can always be contoled by any external party. So, while it might be tempting to think that a var
