The contract has a function called `claim` that claims a portion of the accumulated Alpha tokens for a user. This function has the modifier `nonReentrency` which means that it cannot be called recursively.

In the `accumulateAlphatoUser` function, the `_amount`_ variable is set to `userAcculatedAlpha` for the user calling the method. In the createReceitp function the same variable `_amout` is used to set the amount of tokens in a new receipt, but this time the value is stored in `newReceipt.ammount`.
Since the two values are different, it is possible that the data in receipt is dependent on `amont`.
