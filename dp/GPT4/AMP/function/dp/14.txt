   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to a course that will probably end up teaching me nothing but painful memorization of arcane syntax.  I've tried it and it didn't seem to help.  
   I'm a writer, I write in English, and I know some basic grammar and spelling.   
   Could you give me a few good starting points?  How do I find good books? How can I get started practicing?  
   Please don't tell me to "google it", that's not going to work. I want to do it. 
   Please help me.   I have been trying for 3 days now.  
   
   Thank you.

I'm writing this on my iPad Pro, with a stylus. Is that a problem? I can't believe I'll be typing with one soon. It's like the iPhones and iPads are getting old. 

Please help!
