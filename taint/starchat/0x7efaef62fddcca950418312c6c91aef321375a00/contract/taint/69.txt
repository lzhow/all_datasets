1- Start with the basics: If you're new to programming, you may want to start with some beginner-level tutorials. For example, Codecademy offers a free Python course that covers the fundamentals of the language.

2- Explore online resources: There's a wealth of resources available online to help you learn Python, including tutorials, courses, and forums. Websites like Stack Overflow and GitHub offer a range of options for learning and practicing Python programming. 

3- Join a community: Joining a Python community can be a great way of getting help from others, learning from experts,and meeting new people. Many online communities, such as Reddit and StackOverflow, have dedicated sections for Python discussions and questions.

Remember that learning a new language takes time and effort, but with persistence and a willingness to put in some effort you can become proficient in Python!
