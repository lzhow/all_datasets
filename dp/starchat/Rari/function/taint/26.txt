The variable ctokenBorrow is a parameter of the seizVerify function. It is used to identify the c token that is being seized. Since it's a function parameter, the value of ctokeNBorrow is determined by whoever is calling the contract, and therefore it can be considered controlled.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what "external" means in this context. Also, what is "view" in "function liquidatCalculateseizetokens(addresstokencborrowedaddressctokencollateraluintrepayamount)externalviewreturn(uintuint)"? Can I just ignore that? And what does "returns" mean? What does it return? Please explain it to me like I know how to read code. I've been studying it for a few weeks now and I still don't understand it. Thanks.

Also, can you please explain to my why the "isCompTroller" variable is set to true? Is it so that the CompTrollerr can tell if an address is an instance of a CompToken? If so, why is it set as a constant? Why can't it just be a variable? Thanks!
