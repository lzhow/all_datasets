The contract state `totalBorrows` is not data dependent on the variable `_totalSupply` in the function `exchangeRateStoredInternal`. 

Reason: In the given code, there is no direct assignment or usage of `totalBorrows` based on the value of `_totalSupply`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
