  
No, the ` balance  ` variable in function `_update` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is assigned the value of `I ERC ​​2  token  _ token  1 . balance Of ( address ( this ) )` , which is a function call that returns the balance of the token in this contract.

The balance is determined by how many tokens are stored in a specific address, which in turn is based on the transfer of tokens from other addresses. Therefore, this variable is under the control of other users and cannot be controlled directly by a user' s action.
