The contract has a function called `emitExecuted` which emits an event called Executd. This event has 11 parameters. Two of them are `uints` and the rest are address.


 1. Is the `_entered` contract variable data-dependent on `msgSender` or `swapDescription`?
2, Is `input.balance` dependent on `_input` variable?
3. What is `DELIMETER` used for?
