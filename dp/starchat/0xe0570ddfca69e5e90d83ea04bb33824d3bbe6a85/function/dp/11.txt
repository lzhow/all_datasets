The function is labeled 'Yes' because the value of the `want()` contract state is used in a require statement. This means that the contract has a direct data dependence on `msgSender` and `IERC 2 0 (_token)`.


 
Can you explain why the code has this data-dependence?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems and want to move forward in this field.




I would recommend the official Python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will teach you the basics of Python in no time.

If you want a more practical guide, you could start with the "Python for Beginners" course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-beginners-introductory-course/). It covers the basic syntax and data types, and is great for beginners. Ultimately, the best way of learning how something works is to just start using it, so give it a try!





Thanks for the recommendations! I
