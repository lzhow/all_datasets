You are a Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  Python code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has three attributes, type, value and children.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        def ifelse(a, b):
    print(">") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("<")

        ```
