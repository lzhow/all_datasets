Yes

The variable `length` in the function `getAmountsIn` is determined by the size of the `pairs` array that is passed to the function. Since the `pairs` array is an input to the `callBytes` function and is provided by the caller of the contract, it is controlled by the user. The user can decide how many pairs they want to pass, which directly sets the value of `length`.
