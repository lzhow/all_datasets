Explanation: The variable `result` in the function `baseUnitToCurveDecimal` is data dependent on the variable `amount` in the same function. This is because the value of `result` is assigned the value of `amount` in the if statement `result = amount;`. Therefore, any changes in the value of `amount` will affect the value of `result`.
