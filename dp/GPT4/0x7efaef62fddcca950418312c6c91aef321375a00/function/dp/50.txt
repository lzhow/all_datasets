Reason: The variable `rootKLast` in the function `_mintFee` is calculated based on the value of `kLast`, which is a state variable that can be modified within the `_mintFee` function. The modification of `kLast` is conditional on the `feeOn` boolean, which is determined by whether the `feeTo` address is non-zero. If `feeOn` is false and `_kLast` is not zero, `kLast` is set to zero.

In the `swap` function, the variables `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` are obtained from the `getReserves()` call and are used to check for sufficient liquidity and to calculate the amounts in and out. These variables represent the reserves of the two assets in the liquidity pool.

The data dependency relationship arises because the reserves (`_reserve0` and `_reserve1`) can influence the liquidity added or removed from the pool, which in turn can affect the `kLast` state variable. The `kLast` variable is intended to represent the product of the reserves at the last liquidity event (mint or burn). When liquidity is added or removed in the `swap` function, the `_update` function is called, which can update the `kLast` variable based on the new reserves.

Since `kLast` can be updated based on the reserves, and `rootKLast` is derived from `kLast`, there is a data dependency between `rootKLast` and `_reserve0` because a change in `_reserve0` can lead to a change in `kLast`, which would affect `rootKLast`. Therefore, `rootKLast` is data-dependent on `_reserve0`.
