  
No, the `` variable in function ``_accept_implementation`` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can only be accessed within the scope of the `_acceptImplentation` function.

The `msg` variable is a global variable that holds the message data for the current call, and the `sender` field of ` msg` is set to the address of  the caller of this function, which is `pendingComtrollerImplmentation`.
