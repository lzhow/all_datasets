Label: yes

Reason: The variable `borrowAmount` in the function `borrowAllowed` is an argument provided to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it is meant to be called from outside the contract, typically by a user transaction. The user calling this function specifies the value of `borrowAmount`, which means that this variable is controlled by the user.
