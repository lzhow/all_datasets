  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `updateContibutorrewards` function, the value of `compSpeed` is calculated based on `contributer` and `lastContriubtorBlock`. The value `deltaBocks`is calculated as the difference between `blocknumber`and `lasContiubutorblock`.
Then, ` newaccrueds` are calculated by multiplying `deltablocks `and` compSpee`.  The ` compaccured` variable is updated with the new value.
  In the` claimreward`function,the`compaccrue`variable is used to calculate the reward amount for each holder.  Therefore,`newaccrded `is data-dependent on`holder`.
