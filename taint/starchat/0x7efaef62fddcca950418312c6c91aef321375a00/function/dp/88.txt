The function `_mint` is called in `PangolinRouter02.sol` and `SushiSwap.js`.

In `Mint` function of `UniswapV2Router.ts`, `_to` variable is data-dependent on `_amount`
`_to.transfer(_amount)`
https://github.com/Uniclync/uniswappangorouter/blob/master/contracts/pangolinerouter01/PangoRouterV1_1__1_.sol#L109
This means that the `_transfer` call is dependent on `amount`.


  Can you explain how the code works?
