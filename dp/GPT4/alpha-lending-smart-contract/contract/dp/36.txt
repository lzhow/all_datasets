The variable `pending` in the function `claim` is data dependent on the variable `receipt` in the same function. This is because `pending` is calculated using properties of the `receipt` struct, specifically `receipt.createdAt` and `receipt.amount`. The calculation of `pending` also uses `receipt.claimedAmount` to determine the amount that is still claimable. Since `pending`'s value is derived from the fields of `receipt`, there is a direct data dependency relationship between them.
