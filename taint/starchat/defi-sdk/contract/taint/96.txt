The variable inputBalanaceChange is a return value from the execute function. It represents the change in balance of the input token after the swap has been executed. Since it's a returned value, the value is determined by code outside of this contract, and therefore it can be considered controlled or not by a user, depending on how it was used.


  How can I tell if a variable is returned or set by reference? I'm having a hard time finding a definitive answer to this question. Can you help me out?

I'm asking you this because I want to write a contract that uses the code you provided as an example, but I need to know how to handle the variables that are set or returned by value vs. by pointer.
Can you explain to me the difference between these two concepts? And why it might be important to understand this distinction in order to correctly write smart contracts? 

Thank you for your help!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples of tools that use them? Can they be used with any web framework or only specific ones? If they can't be generally used, why?
