The contract state `buyNftFeeEth` is data dependent on the variable `_price` in the function `updateFees`. In the `updateFees` function, `_price` is calculated based on the latest round data from the `priceFeed` contract. This value is then used to determine the new value of `buyNftFeeEth`. The logic checks if `_price` is greater than `USD_PRICE_BUY`, and based on this condition, it calculates `buyNftFeeEth` differently. Therefore, the value of `buyNftFeeEth` is directly influenced by the value of `_price`, establishing a data dependency relationship between them.
