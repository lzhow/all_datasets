  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `getReserve` function, the `_blockTimeStampLast`, `_klast`, and `_feeto` variables are assigned values. In the`_maintF`ee`function, these variables, such as` _feet`o, are used to calculate the value of`rootk` and` rootklas`t. Therefore,` `_ reserv`e0 and ` _ reser`ve1 are dependent on`roo`tk`and` roo `tklas `t`.
