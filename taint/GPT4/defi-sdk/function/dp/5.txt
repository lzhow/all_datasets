yes

The variable `denominator` in the function `getAmountOut` is data dependent on the variable `reserve1` in the function `getReserves`. This is because `denominator` is calculated using `reserveIn` which is assigned a value from either `reserve0` or `reserve1` based on the `direction` parameter. When `direction` is `false`, `reserveIn` is assigned the value of `reserve1`, and since `denominator` is calculated using `reserveIn`, it indirectly depends on the value of `reserve1`.
