  
No, the `tickSpacinToMxLqdityPertick` function does not depend on ` feeGrwothGloballX2X88`.

The ` tickSapcingToMaLqudtyPerck` funtion calculates the maximum liquidty per tick based on a given tick spacing. It does this by calculating the number of ticks between the minimum and maximum tics and dividing the total liquidtiy by the numbe of tick.
  The ` numticks ` variable is calculated based only on  the tickspacing and the min and max tic values.  It is not dependent on any other variable. Therefore, it is labeled as 'No'.
