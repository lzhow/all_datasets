Reason: The variable `balance` in the function `balanceOfUnderlying` is calculated based on the `exchangeRate` and `accountTokens[owner]`. It does not reference or use the variable `borrowSnapshot` from the function `borrowBalanceStoredInternal`. The `borrowSnapshot` variable is used within the context of the `borrowBalanceStoredInternal` function to calculate a different value, which is the stored borrow balance for a given account. There is no direct data dependency between `balance` and `borrowSnapshot` as they are used in separate functions and calculations, and there is no indication in the provided code snippet that the result of one is used in the computation of the other.
