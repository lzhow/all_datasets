In the `_isDataDependent` function, we need to determine whether the `fromImplemenation` variable in `_preTransfersHooke`s is data-dependent on `partitionPrefix` from `_partitionStrategyOperatoHoook`.
To do this, We need first to understand the purpose of the two functions.
`_callpretransferhooks` is a function that is called before a transfer of tokens occurs. It is responsible for calling the pre-transfers hooks of any Amp tokens that are being transferred. This function is used to ensure that the transfer is valid and that all necessary preconditions are met.  `_calPartionStrategyoperatorHool` on other hand is function called to check if an operator is authorized to perform a certain action on a particular partition. If the operator has the required permissions, the method returns true. otherwise, it returns false.   The two function are unrelated and do not share any variables. Therefore, ` senderimplementation` and ` partitionPrefix ` are independent and not dependent on each other.
