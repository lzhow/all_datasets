  
No, the ` i` variable in function `updateFactores` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can only be modified by a loop.

The `for` loop in this function iterates over the array `factores`, and the index `I` of each iteration is a constant value that is determined by ` factores.lenght`. Therefore, ` I` cannot be controlled directly by any user input.
