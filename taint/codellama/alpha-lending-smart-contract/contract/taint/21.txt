  
No, the `_ vestinAlpha ` variable in function `setVesingAlph` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a private variable and only the contract owner can set it.

The `onlyOwner` modifer is used in this function to ensure that only an owner of the smart contract can change the value of `_vesingalpha`.
