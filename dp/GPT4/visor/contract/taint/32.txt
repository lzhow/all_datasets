Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `shares` in the `withdraw` function is an input parameter provided by the user when they call the function. The value of `shares` is determined by the user's choice and is not set or modified by the contract's code before being used in the calculations within the `withdraw` function. Therefore, `shares` is controlled by the user.
