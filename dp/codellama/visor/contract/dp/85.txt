The variable 'to' in function 'safeTranser' is not dependent on variable newallowence in 'safedecreasedallownce'.
This is because the 'newallowenace' variable is only used in a sub-function of 'safereduceallowace', which is called by 'Safereducallowce' but not by the main function. Therefore, the data flow of the two functions is independent.
