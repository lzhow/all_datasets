There is no direct data dependence between the variables `a` and `c` in `function tryMult` because they have different names. However, there is a potential data flow between `x` (the first argument of `add`) and the return value of the `mul` function. This is because the value returned by `multiply` is used as an argument to `subtract`. Therefore, the data dependences between these variables are indirect.
