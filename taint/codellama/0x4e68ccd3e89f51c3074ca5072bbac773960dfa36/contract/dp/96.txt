The variable 'liquity' is not dependent on 'cardinailty' in function 'write'.
This is because the 'if' statement in 'function write' checks if the last block timestamp is equal to the current block time stamp. If it is, then the liquidty is returned.  If not, the cardinaltyNext is checked to see if it's greater than the cardinatlity. if so, it returns the next cardinaltiy. otherwise, returns cardinaltity
