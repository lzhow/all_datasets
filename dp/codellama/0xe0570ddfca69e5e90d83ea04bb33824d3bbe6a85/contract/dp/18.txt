  
No, the variables `_witdraw ` and `_ shares` are independent.

The variable  `_ withdraw` is calculated based on `bal` and `r` which are both dependent on `_pool` but not on  ` _ shares`.
On the other hand, `_ sharess`is calculated as a function of `total supply`and `shar`es, but it is independent of `_ pool`.
