Explanation: 

The variable `bal_` in the function `intakeRawAndGetBalance` is assigned a value from the function `delegate(_assim, data)`, which is a delegate call to the `_assim` contract. However, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `bal_` and the variable `_assim` in the function `outputRaw`. The value of `_assim` is used as an argument in the `delegate` function, but it does not directly affect the value assigned to `bal_`. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is a data dependency between these two variables based on the provided code snippet.
