In the `binarySearch` function, the expression `lte (time , before Or At. blockTimestamp , target)` depends on `before Or After` and `at OrAfter`, which are both variables in `getS surroundings Observations`. The ` get surrounds Observatios` is called in observe Single, which is where ` time` comes from. Therefore, ` target At Or after` depends directly on` time`.
