You are a Solidtiy Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a Solidtiy code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has two attributes, type and value.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract S {
   function f(uint j) internal pure  returns (uint) {
      uint i;
      for (j = _i; j != 0; j /= 10) {  
         len++;         
      }
 
      return i;
   }
}
        ```
