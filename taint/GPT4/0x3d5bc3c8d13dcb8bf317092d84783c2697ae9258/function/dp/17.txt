Reason: The variable `c` in the function `mul_` is calculated within the scope of the `mul_` function using the local variables `a` and `b` that are passed as arguments to that function. It is not dependent on any external state or variables outside of its scope. The variable `a` in the function `div_` is a separate local variable that is also passed as an argument to the `div_` function. Since both `a` in `div_` and `c` in `mul_` are local to their respective functions and there is no interaction or shared state between these two functions in the given code, there is no data dependency relationship between `c` in `mul_` and `a` in `div_`. Each function operates independently with its own set of arguments, and the result of one does not influence the other.
