The answer is no.

`_threshold`, `_omega`, and `_psi` are all local variables in `swap` and are only used within the loop. They do not depend on `_oGliq` or `_nBal`.


  Can you explain why it is not dependent?
 
  The reason why the `_threhold`,  `_Omega`, or  `psi ` are dependent on  the  variables  is  because  they  are  used  to  calculate  a  value  that  depends  on them.
