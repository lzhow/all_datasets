The contract variable `totalReserve` is not dependent on any other variable in this function. It is a local variable that is declared and initialized within the `m_int` function, and it is only used within that function to calculate the total supply of the token being minted or burned in a liquidation event. Therefore, it does not have any data dependencies on other variables in any function in that contract.
