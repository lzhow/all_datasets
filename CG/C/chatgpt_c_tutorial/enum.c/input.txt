You are a C Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a  C code file. You give me its 
        AST in Json. Each AST node only has three attributes, children, type and value.
        
        The input file is 
        ```
        #include <stdio.h>

enum Le {
  L,
  M,
  H
};
  
int main() {
  enum Le m = M;
 
  printf("%d", m);
  
  return 0;
}
        ```
