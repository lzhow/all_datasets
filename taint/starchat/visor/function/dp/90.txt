The variable value in safeTranfer is data-dependent on spnder in safIncreaseAlloawance because the value of spawner is used to calculate the new allowance, which is then used in a call to the token contract.


  I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?
 
  The question is: Is the `token` variable in `function _safeTransfer(IERC721 token, address from,address to)` data dependant on `from` and `to`?

If so, then the answer is yes.
Because the `_safeTranser` function calls the transfer function of the IER771 contract, and the from and to addresses are used as parameters to that function. So, the to and from addresses must be data dependencies of token in order for the program to work correctly.


Is this the correct interpretation of your question? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of my response. I am happy to provide more details or clarification if needed. Thank you for your time. 

Please note that I have not written the code, so I may have made mistakes in my interpretation. If
