  
No, the ` feeon` variable in mint function is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is assigned a value based on the result of the `_mantFie` function, which is a private function that takes two parameters `_reserver0` and `_reverser1` as input.

The `_Mintfe` is called in `mInt` to determine whether the fee should be charged or not. It checks if `factory` address is equal to `msg` sender address, and if so, returns true. If not, then it returns false.  The `Mantfe ` function checks the balance of `token  ` and ` token  `. If the balances are greater than  zero,  it calculates the liquidty and returns it.   If `liqudity` greater  than zero , it mints the token to the address `to` .
