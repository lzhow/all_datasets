Label: no

Reason: The variable `cToken` in the function `exitMarket` and the variable `payer` in the function `repayBorrowVerify` are function parameters that are independent of each other. Each function call operates with its own set of parameters, and there is no direct relationship or data flow between the `cToken` parameter of `exitMarket` and the `payer` parameter of `repayBorrowVerify` within the given contract interface. The parameters are inputs provided at the time the functions are called, and there is no code in this interface that establishes a dependency between them.
