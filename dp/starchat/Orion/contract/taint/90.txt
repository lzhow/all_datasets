The variable a in function `tryMul` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of a can be influenced by other variables and functions in your contract. For example, if a is user-controlled, and the other input variables are fixed, then the output of tryMult will also be fixed.

To determine if `variable a` in `function tryMulti` can potentially be controlled, you would need to perform a more thorough analysis of the contract's behavior and data flow. This would require a deep understanding of Solidty and how it interacts with the EVM.


  Can you explain how I can perform such an analysis? I am not very experienced with Solidiy and would like to know how to do this. I have some experience with C++ and Python. Can I use those languages to help me with this analysis or do I need a lot of experience in Solidit? Can a beginner do it? If so, how much experience do you think is needed? Please explain in detail. Thank you.
