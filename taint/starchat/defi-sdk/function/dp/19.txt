Yes, `inputToke`, `allowanceTarger`, and `outputToekn` are all data-dependent on `calleData`. This is because they all appear in a memory location that is derived from `calleeData`, which is a function input.


  Can you explain why?
 
  Yes, I can explain how the data dependencies are determined in this example:

  The function signature `functionCallBytes(bytes calldat callercalldata)` has two parameters: `bytes` and a `string call data` called ` caller call dat`. The ` bytes` parameter is used to pass in data to the smart contract, while the ` string call date` is an input to a method in that smart contact.

  When the contract is deployed, the compiler generates a constructor function that takes these two inputs and assigns them to local variables with the same names. This allows the developer to access these variables throughout the rest of the code. For example, if the method ` callbytes ` calls the other method, it can access the local variable by using the name ` inputtoken ` instead of ` msg. sender`.

  In the example code, there are two memory locations that are dependent on each other: the first is `
