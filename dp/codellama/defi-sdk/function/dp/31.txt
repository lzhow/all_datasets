In the `function` ` getAmoutIn`, the value of ` reservein` is calculated using the formula:
`(numerador / denominaor)  +1`
where `numerado` and `denominador` are both calculated from the values of the variables ` reservesIn ` and` reserveout` respectively.
Therefore, the calculation of`reserverIn' in ` function` get AmountIn depends on `reverserOut'in ` the` function' get Reserves.
