Reason: The contract state `totalSupplyByPartition` is data dependent on the variable `_from` in the function `swap`. This is because the `swap` function eventually calls the `_mint` function, which in turn calls `_addTokenToPartition`. The `_addTokenToPartition` function modifies the `totalSupplyByPartition` mapping by increasing the total supply for a specific partition, which in this case is the `defaultPartition`. The amount by which the `totalSupplyByPartition` is increased is equal to the `amount` of tokens that are being swapped, and this `amount` is determined by the allowance that `_from` has given to the contract to transfer tokens on their behalf. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between the `totalSupplyByPartition` state and the `_from` variable within the context of the `swap` function.
