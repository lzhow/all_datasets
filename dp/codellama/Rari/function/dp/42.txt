  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `finishInteresAccural` function, the calculation of `interesIndex` is dependent on `totalBorrow` and `blockDelta`.
`totalborrows` are updated in `SeizInternal` by subtracting `protocolseizetokans` from `accounttokens[Borrwer]`.
Therefore, `BorerIndexnew` depends on both `Totalborrrow`and `BlockDelta` which are also updated by `SiezeInternal`.
