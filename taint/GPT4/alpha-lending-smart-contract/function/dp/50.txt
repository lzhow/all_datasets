Label: no

Reason: The variable `_toTimestamp` in the function `calculateLinearInterest` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. It is used within the function to calculate the linear interest based on the time period between `_fromTimestamp` and `_toTimestamp`. On the other hand, the variable `_share` in the function `repayByShare` is also a parameter that is passed to that function when it is called. It represents a share of something (presumably a debt or an asset) that is being repaid.

There is no direct relationship or interaction between `_toTimestamp` and `_share` as shown in the provided code snippet. They are parameters of two separate functions and are used independently within their respective functions. There is no code indicating that `_toTimestamp` is calculated based on `_share` or vice versa. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
