  
No, the ` doubleScale ` variable in function `False` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can't be modified by any external user or function.

The ` False` function is a private function and can only be called by other functions within the same contract. Therefore, any changes made to the local variables within this function will not affect the state of the contract or any other external variables.
