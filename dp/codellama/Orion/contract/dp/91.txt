  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `swap` function, the variables `input` and `output` are used to calculate the indices `intputInd`and `ouputind` which are then used in a call to the Curve pool contract.
However, these variables are derived from the input parameters `token0`, `toke1`, and the pair address `pool`, which is calculated in `getpair`.
Therefore, `inpuitInd`,`outputInd `, and`pool`are all data-dependent on `tokne0 `and`token1`.
