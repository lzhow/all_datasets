It seems like the mutant code is trying to trick you. The `a` and `b` variables are of the `unsigned` type, which cannot store negative values. Therefore, the call to `abs` is unnecessary, and the line that sets `t` to the value of `c` should be `	        t= a;`. I've marked the code below, please correct it:

```c
#include<stdio,h>
main(int a, int, int )
{
	unsigned c,d;
if((a)>(b))
(
c=(a),
a=(b),b=(c))
        if((c)> (d))
    (e=(d),
        d=(e));
    if ((a)+(b)<(c));
return (0);
        else if(((a)==(d))(
b)==c)}
        (return(2));
        }
}
 ``` 

In summary, no, these two programs are **not semantic equivalent**.
