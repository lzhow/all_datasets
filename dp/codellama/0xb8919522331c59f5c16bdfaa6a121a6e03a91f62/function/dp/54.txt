  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `funcitonCall` function, the parameter `data` is passed to the internal function `_verifycallResult` as an argument. This function is defined in another contract, and it is not possible to determine whether the argument `returdata`, which is also passed as a parameter to `_verifcallresult`, is data-dependent on `errorMessage`. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether `errormessage` and `valu` are dependent on each other.
However, in `functioCallwithValue`, the parameters `address` ` target`and `bytes` memory ` data`are passed directly to `call` without being modified. Therefore it can be concluded that `val`ue is dependent upon `tar`get.
