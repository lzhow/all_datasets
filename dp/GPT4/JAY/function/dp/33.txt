Explanation: The variable `total` in the function `buyJay` is data dependent on the variable `amounts` in the function `buyJayWithERC1155`. This is because the value of `total` is updated based on the return value of the `buyJayWithERC1155` function, which is determined by the `amounts` array passed as an argument to the function.
