Explanation: The variable `allowanceNew` in the function `transferTokens` is not directly dependent on the variable `mathErr` in the function `exchangeRateStoredInternal`. There is no direct assignment or calculation between these two variables. However, it is possible that the value of `mathErr` indirectly affects the value of `allowanceNew` through the execution of other statements or functions within the respective functions. Without further analysis of the code, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
