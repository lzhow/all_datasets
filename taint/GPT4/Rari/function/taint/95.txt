Label: no

Reason: The variable `startingBalance` in the function `getCashPrior` is not controlled by the user. It is calculated by subtracting `msg.value` from the balance of the contract (`address(this).balance`). The value of `msg.value` is controlled by the user, but it is used to calculate `startingBalance` and not directly assigned to it. Therefore, `startingBalance` is not controlled by the user.
