The variable _underlyAsset in function contructor is a controlled variable. It is assigned to an external contract address.


  How does the contract determine if a variable is user controlled or not? Is there a way to determine that without executing the code? If so, how?

I'm writing a tool to help developers identify potential security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. One of the key features of my tool is to be able to automatically determine whether a contract variable or function parameter is "user-controlled" or "contract-owned". I would like to include this feature in my analysis of your contract, but I need a clear answer to this question first.
Please let me know if you need any more information. I'm happy to provide whatever assistance I can. Thank you!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. Also mention the pros and cons of using an incremental bundling approach in web development. What are the advantages? What potential problems might I run into? Please be very concrete and provide examples. If possible, compare
