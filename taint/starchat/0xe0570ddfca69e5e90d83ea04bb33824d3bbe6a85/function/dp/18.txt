The contract function 'proposStra' in your code snippet is used to propose a new strategy for the vault contract. This function takes in an address '_implementation' as a parameter, which represents the address of the new proposed strategy.

It is important to note that the '_implementaion' parameter is a contract address, and not a state variable. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the'strategy' contract's state is data-dependent on '_implemenation' at compile-time. At runtime, the code will check if '_implemetation' is indeed the implementation address for a strategy contract, before updating the state of'stratCandidate'.
Therefore, we cannot determine at compilation time if'stratey' has a direct or indirect dependency on 'implementation'.


  Can you explain why it's not?





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies.

 
  An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bundl ingtogether all the files that are required to run
