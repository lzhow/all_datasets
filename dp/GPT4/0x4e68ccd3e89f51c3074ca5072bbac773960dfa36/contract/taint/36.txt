Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `b` in the function `mulDivRoundingUp` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, and its value is determined by the caller of the function. Without further context or information about how the value of `b` is obtained, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label for the variable `b` is "unknown".
