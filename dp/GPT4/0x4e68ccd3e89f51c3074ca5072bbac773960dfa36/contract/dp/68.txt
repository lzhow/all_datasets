yes

In the `add` function for `uint256`, the variable `z` is directly assigned the result of `x + y`, which means that the value of `z` is computed based on the value of `y`. Therefore, `z` is data dependent on `y`. Similarly, in the `add` function for `int256`, `z` is also assigned the result of `x + y`, establishing a data dependency relationship between `z` and `y`. In both cases, the value of `z` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `y`, hence they are data dependent.
