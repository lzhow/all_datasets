The variable "mathError" is not dependent on "error" in either function.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand your answer. Could you please explain what you mean by "data dependent" and "not data dependend"?
 
  Data dependence is a relationship between two or more variables in a program, where changing the value of one variable may cause a change in another variable. In the context of your question, the relationship is between the variables "MathErr" (in the "acccruelInterest" function) and the return value "Error (Error)" (also in that function).

In the case of the first function, it is used to track any errors that may occur during the calculation of interest accrued. If an error does occur, then the program will return the error code stored in "uint ( matherr)" instead of continuing with the rest of its calculations.
However, in your second function ("_setreservefactor"), the only variable that is directly dependent upon the other is "newreservefactormantis" which is passed as an argument to the second method. This means that changing "NewReservefactorMantisa" will cause the dependent variables to change as well,
