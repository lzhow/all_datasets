  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the first function, the `staticCall` function is called on `address( proxy)` with the hex string `hex'f 8 5 1 a 4 04'`. The return value of this function call is stored in a tuple of type `(bool,bytes)`. The second element of the tuple is assigned to the local variable named ` ret urndat a`.
  The `require` statement checks if the call was successful. If it was not successful, it will revert the transaction.
   The function returns the decoded value from the return data.  In the second function , the same function calls are made, but the returned value is not stored. Instead, a new variable is created and assigned the value returned by the static call. This new value will be used in place of ` proxy` .
Because the two functions have the exact same code, except for the last line, which assigns the result of staticCall to a different variable, we can conclude that the variables `  proxy ` and `   ret  urn  data` are dependent on each other.
