Explanation:
In the `_do_swap` function, the `swap_data` struct contains a `path` field that is an array of addresses representing the tokens in a swap path (e.g., `[token0_address, ..., last_token_adress]`). The `cur_factory` and `support_fee` fields are used to determine the type of swap to perform.
When the swap is performed, it is done by calling the appropriate swap function based on `isCurved` (which is determined by the value of `supported_factors[factory]`), and passing in `pair`, `input`, and the other relevant fields.  The swap functions are defined in `_curve_pool` or `_uniswap_like_pair`.
These functions use the reserve values to calculate the amount of tokens to be swapped. In the case of `_swaps`, the reserves are obtained from the pair contract. Therefore, ` amount  ` is data-dependent on  the  reserve  value.
