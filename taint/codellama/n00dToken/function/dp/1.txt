In the constructor function, the `_mints` function is called, which is a function of the ER727 contract. This function takes three arguments: the address of a recipient, an amount of tokens to mint, a user data string, and a operator data.
When the `m_mits` is executed, it will mint the specified amount to the recipients address.  The `_ balances ` state is updated to reflect the new balance of each recipent. Therefore, `_ balance` state depends on ` initial supply` variable.
