The variable target in function `functionDelegatecall` is a user-controlled input. This function allows the contract to call another contract with the provided data. Since the target contract can modify state variables or perform other actions, the input to this function must be considered user controlled.


  Can you give me an example of a contract that uses this library and has a bug where the `isContrac`t function always returns true? I want to see how the static analysis tools I am developing can help me find these kinds of bugs.

Also, can you explain how I can use the tool you developed to find other bugs in my contracts? How can I use it to check if my contract has any reentrancy vulnerabilities? Can it check for integer overflow and underflow bugs?
Can you also explain to me how you can integrate it with my existing CI/CD pipeline so that it can automatically check my smart contracts for bugs every time I push new code? Please provide detailed step-by-step instructions. I'm a bit confused about how to do this. Thanks!
