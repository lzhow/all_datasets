The contract function '_mint' is used to mint new tokens and transfer them to an account. It takes two inputs: the address of the recipient account and the amount of tokens to be minted.

When analyzing the code, it is not immediately clear whether the '_balances' contract variable is data-dependent on 'amount'. The '_beforeTransfer' function is called, which may modify '_balance' in some cases. Additionally, the 'total_supply' variable may also be modified in this function. Therefore, without additional information, there is no definitive answer to whether '_balanaces' depends on amount.


 1. Is the total_suply variable data dependant on any of its dependencies?
 2. If so, what are they?





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple syntax errors and want to start using this language to make cool things. I have heard that python has the most simplistic syntax of any language, is that true? Please help me start off on this path. Thank you.  Also please list some good first projects that I could do with this new language. Thanks.
