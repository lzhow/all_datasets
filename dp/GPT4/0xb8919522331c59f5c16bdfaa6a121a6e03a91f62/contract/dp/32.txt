In the `sendValue` function, the `success` variable is assigned the result of the `recipient.call{ value: amount }("")` operation. This operation attempts to send the specified `amount` of Ether to the `recipient`. The `success` variable will be `true` if the call succeeds and `false` if it fails. Since the call operation involves transferring the `amount` of Ether and the outcome of this operation determines the value of `success`, there is a data dependency between `success` and `amount`. If the `amount` changes, it could affect whether the call operation succeeds or fails, and thus affect the value of `success`.
