  
The variable  `_ subtractedvalue` in function `decreaseAllowances` is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user through the `transact` function.

In the contract, the `_approvedByParition` mapping is used to store the allowances of the token holders. When a token holder calls the decrease allowence function, they can specify the amount of tokens they want to decrease the approval for. This amount is stored in `_ subtractionValue`.
Therefore, `_SubtractionsValue ` is a variable that can directly be influenced by user input, and it should be considered as controlled.
