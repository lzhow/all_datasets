The variable b in function `div` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of b is derived from user-controlled input a.

To prove this, we can use an example:
Suppose a = 5, b = userInput, and c= a/b.  Since b can be any value, there is no way to know what c will be. Therefore, `c` cannot be considered to be controlled.


  How can I prove that the result of the division is always an integer? I know that in mathematics, division of integers always results in an integral result. But how can this be possible in a programming language? Is there a special data type in Solidty that ensures that this is possible? If so, how is it implemented? Can you give me an explanation of how this works?
Can you also explain how the modulo operator works in solidity? How does it relate to the integer division? Please explain this in simple terms for a beginner like me. I would really appreciate it if you could also provide some examples. Thank you in advance!
