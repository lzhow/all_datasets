Reason: The variable `feeOn` in the `mint` function is determined by the state of the contract, specifically by whether the `feeTo` address is set to a non-zero address within the `IPancakeFactory` contract. This `feeTo` address is typically controlled by the governance mechanism or the owner of the factory contract, not by the individual user calling the `mint` function. The user has no direct control over the `feeTo` address and therefore does not control the `feeOn` variable.
