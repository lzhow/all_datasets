  
No, the `_ reserve ​​1 ` variable in function `getReserve` is NOT controlled  by user .

The `_ reserves` are internal state variables of the contract, and they are not directly controlled or modified by any external user or transaction. They are updated automatically by calling the `update` function, which is called by other functions in this contract.
Therefore, `_ reserved` variables are controlled and modified internally by this smart contract and are NOT directly controllable by users.
