The variable adminFantasma is defined in a different contract, which is called CAdminFuse. This contract is used to manage the admin fee for the CToken contract. It is a separate contract from the main CERC2O contract that contains the implementation of the ERC-223 token. Therefore, the value of adminFeManta is set by a third-party contract and is therefore not under the control of a user of this contract directly.
