Reason: The variable `_oBals` in the function `proportionalDeposit` is calculated based on the current state of the `curve` which includes the balances of the assets in the curve. This state can be affected by the `_deposit` variable in the function `viewProportionalDeposit` because `_deposit` is used to calculate `__deposit`, which in turn is used to determine the new balances and liquidity after a deposit operation. Although `viewProportionalDeposit` is a view function and does not modify the state, it is designed to simulate the state after a deposit operation based on the input `_deposit`. Therefore, `_oBals` is data dependent on `_deposit` because changes in `_deposit` would affect the simulated state that `viewProportionalDeposit` is trying to represent, which includes the balances of assets that `_oBals` represents in `proportionalDeposit`.
