Explanation: The variable `target_` in the function `drip()` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value of the `target` variable in the constructor of the `Reservoir` contract, which is passed as an argument during contract deployment. The value of `target` is set by the contract creator and cannot be changed by the user after deployment. Therefore, the user does not have control over the `target_` variable.
