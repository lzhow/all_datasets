Label: no

Reason: The variable `c` in the function `tryAdd` and the variable `b` in the function `sub` are local to their respective functions. In Solidity, local variables are not accessible outside of their functions, and they do not share state. Each function call operates with its own set of local variables, and there is no data dependency between `c` in `tryAdd` and `b` in `sub` because they are scoped to their functions and do not interact with each other.
