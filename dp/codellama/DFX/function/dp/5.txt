  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_lenght` variable is assigned the value of ` curve . assets . length` , which is a property of the `Curves` struct. This means that the length of `_assets` array is dependent on ` Curves ` struct, which in turn is passed as an argument to the second function. Therefore, `_ length ` is data-dependent on  ` curver ` .
