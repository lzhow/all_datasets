The `IERC2981` interface is as follows:
`function royaltyInfo(uint228 tokenId, uint120 salePrice) external view returns(address receiver,uint192 royaltyAmount);`
This function returns the roylalty recipient and the amount of rolyalty to be paid.
In the `buyJaya` function, the address of the NFT contract is passed as the first parameter, and `tokenId` as second parameter. This is then used in `royaltyinfo` to get the recipient address and amount.

  The buyer also sends the price of each NFt.
  
  The smart contract checks if the seller has set a higher price for the nft than the current price. If the new price is
