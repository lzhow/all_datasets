The variable _ new owner is a parameter of the transferownership function, which is only accessible to contract owners. Therefore, the answer is no, and the _ variable is considered to be uncontrolled by users.


  How can I make sure that the `_owner` variable in `approve` function is indeed controlled and not user controlled?

I'm writing a tool to analyze Solidty smart contracts and I'm using your tool as one of my modules. I need to know for sure if this variable can be considered user-controlled or not.
Can you please help me with this? I would really appreciate it. Thank you. 

Here is my code:
`function approve ( address owner_, address to_,  uint value_)`






   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples? Can you explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced? Thanks!
