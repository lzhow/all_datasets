Reason: The variable `_tokenHolder` in the function `partitionsOf` is a function argument that represents the address of the token holder whose partitions are being queried. The function `decimals` is a pure function, meaning it does not read from or modify the state of the contract. It simply returns a constant value (in this case, the number 18, representing the number of decimal places for the token). Since `decimals` does not interact with any state variables and has no parameters, there is no data dependency between `_tokenHolder` and the `decimals` function.
