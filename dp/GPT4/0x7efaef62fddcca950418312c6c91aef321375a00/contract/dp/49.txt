Label: yes

Reason: In the Solidity contract provided, the contract state `token0` is directly assigned the value of the local variable `_token0` within the `initialize` function. This assignment creates a data dependency relationship between `token0` and `_token0`, as the state of `token0` is determined by the value passed to `_token0` when `initialize` is called. Here is the relevant line of code from the `initialize` function:

```solidity
function initialize(address _token0, address _token1) external {
    require(msg.sender == factory, 'Pancake: FORBIDDEN'); // Access control check
    token0 = _token0; // Direct assignment creating data dependency
    token1 = _token1;
}
```

Since `token0` is being set to the value of `_token0`, there is a clear data dependency between these two variables.
