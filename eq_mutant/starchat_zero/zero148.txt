I am sorry, but it is not possible to automatically analyze or compare the contents of two code samples in a way that would guarantee semantic equivalence. The reason is that the code in these samples could have many more variations than those considered by the comparison tool, so even if it might look like there might be a slight difference, there could very well be some serious consequences for the intended behavior of the program.

In the case of C code, some tools that attempt to do this analysis include Semmle, Coverity, and CodeSonar. For Java code there is PMD, Checkstyle, FindBugs, Android Lint, Eclipse, etc.
