Explanation: The variable `amountB` in the function `quoteUv2` is data dependent on the variable `reserveB` in the same function because `amountB` is calculated using the value of `reserveB` in the expression `amountA.mul(reserveB) / reserveA`. Therefore, any change in the value of `reserveB` will affect the value of `amountB`.
