   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.  How about Webpack? Rollup? Vite? Snowpack? Etc. etc. explain which you prefer and why. I am specifically looking to create a new React app from scratch. Thanks.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bundLING together (or "bundling") all the various files that make up a web page into a single file that the browser can load and render.

An incremental build tool analyzes the dependencies between the files in a project and only rebuilds parts
