Explanation: The variable `amount` in the function `_burn` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function `_burn` and is used to determine the amount of tokens to burn from the `_balances` mapping. However, the value of `amount` is not directly influenced or controlled by the user. It is up to the contract owner or the calling function to determine the value of `amount` before calling the `_burn` function. Therefore, the control over the variable `amount` is not clear from the given code snippet.
