  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `balanceOf` function, the local variable 'snaptshoted' is assigned the value of the expression `_valueAT( snapshotID,_accountbalancesnapShots [account])`. The expression is a function call to the `_ valueAt` method, which takes two arguments: ` snapshot ID` and `_account balance snapShot [ account]`. The value returned by the method is then assigned to ` snap shotted`.
On the other hand, in `_ updateAccount snapshot` , the parameter ` account` is passed to `_ account balance snapshot [Account]` , which is an array of type `uint 2 5 6`. This means that the array element at the index `Account` contains the balance of ` Account`. Therefore, when the element is updated in ` _ update account snapshot`, the corresponding balance in` _ accountBalancesnapshot [ Account]` is also updated.
Therefore, `Sna ptsho t` depends on `accoun t`.
