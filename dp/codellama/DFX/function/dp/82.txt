  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `calculateTraade` function, the `_omega` variable is calculated using the curve and weights, and it is used to calculate the output amount.
Then, in `for` loop, `_psi` is also calculated in a similar way, but using different values of `_oGliq`, `_inputAmount`, and `_weighs`.
Finally, `outputAmount` and `prevAmount ` are compared, if they have the same value, then the loop continues, otherwise, it breaks.  In the latter case,  `_nextutil` , `_prevutil`,  and  `diff `are calculated, which are all dependent on `_omeg`a and`_psi`.  Therefore,` _omega`and`psi `have a dependency on`diff`.
