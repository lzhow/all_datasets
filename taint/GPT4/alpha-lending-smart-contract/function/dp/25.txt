Label: yes

Reason: In the Solidity code provided, the variable `value` in the function `decodeI8` is directly dependent on the variable `data` passed to it from the function `decodeI16`. This is because `decodeI8` is called twice within `decodeI16`, and each time it is called, it uses the `data` parameter from `decodeI16` to perform its operation and return an `int8` value that is then used to construct the `int16` value in `decodeI16`. The data dependency is established by the fact that the output of `decodeI8` (which assigns to `value`) is influenced by the `data` input it receives from `decodeI16`.
