The variable `data.offset` in the function `finished` is not data dependent on the variable `value` in the function `decodeBytes`. The function `finished` checks if the `offset` of the `data` struct is equal to the length of the `raw` bytes array, which is a condition to determine if the end of the data has been reached. On the other hand, the function `decodeBytes` creates a new bytes array `value` and fills it with data by decoding bytes from the `data.raw` array, starting at the current `data.offset`. The `finished` function does not use or modify the `value` variable from `decodeBytes`, and the `decodeBytes` function does not use or modify the `offset` variable from `finished`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between these two variables.
