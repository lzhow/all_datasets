yes, the `_lenght` variable is a user controlled variable. It is used to loop through the `assets` array and is therefore user controllable.


  Can you explain how the length variable can be used by a malicious user to manipulate the code? Please provide an example of how this could be exploited.

Also, can you please explain why this is an issue and how it can potentially be fixed?
Can you also provide some examples of similar vulnerabilities found in smart contracts? How can they be identified and fixed in a similar manner? 

Thank you for your help!
