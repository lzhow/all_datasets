  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `function` ` getY`, the parameter ` x` is used to calculate the value of `c` and `S_`.
`c =c*D/(x*N_Coins)`
 ` S_+ = _ x `
These calculations are dependent on `xp_` which is passed as a parameter to the` get y` function.
However, the values of` x_p` are calculated in ` function`
get `Amount` Out Curve. Therefore, `X`in `Function`get y is data-dependent on` X` from ` Function`Get Amount OutCurves.
