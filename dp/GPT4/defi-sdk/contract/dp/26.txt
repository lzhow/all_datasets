yes

The variable `allowanceTarget` is data dependent on the variable `callerCallData` in the function `callBytes`. This is because `allowanceTarget` is directly extracted from `callerCallData` using the `abi.decode` function. The line:

```solidity
( address inputToken, address allowanceTarget, address payable callTarget, bytes memory callData, address outputToken ) = abi.decode(callerCallData, (address, address, address, bytes, address));
```

shows that `callerCallData` is being decoded into multiple variables, including `allowanceTarget`. Therefore, any changes to `callerCallData` would affect the value of `allowanceTarget`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
