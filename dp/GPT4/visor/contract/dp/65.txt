Label: no

Reason: The variable `a` in the function `tryDiv` and the variable `a` in the function `mod` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. Each function has its own separate execution context, and the parameters are not shared between them. When `tryDiv` or `mod` is called, the values passed to `a` are local to each function call and do not affect each other. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between the variable `a` in `tryDiv` and the variable `a` in `mod`.
