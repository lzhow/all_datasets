  
The label is 'No'.

Reason:
In the `updateCompborrowerIndex()` function, the value of `borrwoSpeed` is calculated based on `marketBorrwoIndex`, which is a parameter of the same function. Therefore, ` borrrowSpeed ` is not dependent on any variable in ` distrubuteSupplliercomp()`.
On the other hand, in  `distrubteSupplerComp()`, the values of  'supplilerIndex' are calculated using the variables `compSupplieIndex[]` and ` compinitialIndex`. Therefore ` supplilierIndex `  is dependent  on  the  variables  of   ` dristributeSupllier Comp()`.
