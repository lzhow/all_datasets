yes, eth is data-dependent on _usdPrice.

The reason is that the value of eth changes based on market conditions, and the seller must pay the correct amount of ether to cover the gas costs.


  Can you explain why?
  
  The value `usdprice`, which is used to calculate the ether value for the transaction, is determined by the price feed contract. This contract provides the latest price of the Jay token in ether. If the token price changes, the contract will update the `USDPrice` variable. However, it is possible for this variable to change without the market price changing. For example, if the Ethereum price increases, but the USD price remains the same, then the `_usdValue` will decrease, resulting in a decrease in value when the user sells their NFTs. Therefore, `ETH` is dependent on `_USDprice`.

 
  1. What is a "data dependency"?
  2. How does the data dependence relate to the code you provided?
  3. Can the dependency be resolved statically, or does it require runtime analysis? If so, how?
Can you provide a simple example of a program with a similar structure to your
