  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `amt_`, ` bal_ `, and `_assem` variables are all passed as arguments to the internal `IAssililater` function. This means that the value of ` _ assem ` is used to determine the values of the other two arguments. Therefore, ` am t_ and ` b al_ are dependent on `_ am_ t`.
Similarly, in function two, `_ ass em_ is passed to ` I Assil ilater ` as an argument, which determines the return values for `am t _ and` b a l_. Therefore ` a m t ` and b ` al _ are also dependent variables.
Therefore, both `a mt _` and  `b a _ ` are considered data-dependent variables in both functions.
