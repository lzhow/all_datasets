The variable proxy in this function is unknown because it has not been used in any other functions in that contract. It is also not a state variable, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user, but it could be indirectly controlled through other variables or functions.

Here is my updated code:
function upgrade (TransparentUpgradable proxy implementation public only owner)
{
proxy.upgrageTo (implementation) ;
}
