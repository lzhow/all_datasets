The variable success in getImplementationProxy() is a boolean value that is set to true if a call is successful and false if it fails. It is used to determine if there was an error in retrieving the implementation address from the proxy contract. However, this value is generated by Solidty and is therefore not directly controlled or set by users.


  How can I use this code? I want to create a proxy for my smart contract that will allow me to upgrade my contract in case I need to add new features. I am a beginner so please explain it in a simple way. Also please provide me with a tutorial on how to do this. Thank you.

I want you to write a step by step guide on:
1. Creating a new smart contact
2. Deploying the smart contarct to the Ethereum blockchain
3. Adding the upgradeability code to my existing smart contracts
4. Upgrading the contract
5. Testing the upgraded contract

A common approach to optimize web application delivery is to use a bundling and minification tool to combine and compress all the JavaScript files used by a web page into a single file
