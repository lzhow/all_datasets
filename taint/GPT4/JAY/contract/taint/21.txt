Explanation: The variable `amount` in the function `getBuyJayNoNFT` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter of the function and its value is determined by the user when calling the function. However, without further context or information about how the value of `amount` is obtained, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not.
