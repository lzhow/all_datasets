The contract variable `_ balances ` is not dependent on ` value ` in function` sell `.
This is because the `_ burn ` function is called with ` msg . sender ` and ` _ burn` does not modify the value of `_ balance`.
Therefore, the data flow analysis of the code does  not show any data dependence between `_ _balance` and` value`.
