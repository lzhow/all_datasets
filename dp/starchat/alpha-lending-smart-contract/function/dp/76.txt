   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am currently in high school, and I took AP Computer Science A in 2 years ago. Is it worth it to just keep using python, or should I switch to a different language? I heard about Java being good for beginners, should i switch? Or should python just do? Please help me decide!
   

  What are some good alternatives to Python?

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language. It is often compared to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, Java, C++, and many other programming languages.
Some of the alternatives are:
Java: Java is platform-independent, secure, portable, robust, easy-to-learn, inexpensive, has a large community, is highly scalable, multi-threaded, dynamic, interpreted and garbage-collected. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. Since 1995, it has been owned by Oracle Corporation
