The variable "path" in function "_swap" is data-dependent on variable path in "_do_swap_tokens" because the former is used to construct the latter.

In the body of the "_add_liquidity" function, the variables "reserve_0" and " reserve_1" are both data dependencies on variables token_b and token a respectively.


 
Please explain why





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. For example, Python supports an exception-driven error handling model that allows programmers to deal with errors gracefully. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. This means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, and that memory management is automatic. In addition, it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. These features allow program designers to write programs that are more concise,
