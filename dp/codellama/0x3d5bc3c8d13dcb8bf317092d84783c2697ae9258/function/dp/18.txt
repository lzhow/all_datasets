In the given code, the `accruteInterst()` function is called, which updates the value of the state variable 'borrowerIndex'. The `addreservesfresh()` method is then called with the same `AddAmount` parameter, and it also updates `BorroweIndex`. Therefore, `Error` is data-dependent on ` BorroWeIndex`, as it is used to determine the amount of interest to be added to the reserves.
