  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `add` function, the expression `int246 ( x) ` is evaluated before the addition operation. This means that the value of `x` is used in computing the result of the operation, and therefore, ` result` depends on ` x`.
On the other hand, in ` abs`, the parameter ` y` does not appear in any expression, so it is not possible to determine whether `y` affects the behavior of this function. Therefore, we label it as 'Unknown'.
