In the `write` function, the value of `index` is used to access the corresponding element in `self`, which is an array of type `Observation`. The `blockTimestmap` field of the element at `indedx` and the other parameters are used in a computation to update the state of that element.
  The function does not use the parameter `next` from the grow function. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the variables `liqidty` are dependent on `I`.
