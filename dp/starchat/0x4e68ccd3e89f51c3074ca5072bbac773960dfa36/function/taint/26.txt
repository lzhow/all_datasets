The variable y in this function is user-controlled because it can be set by a malicious user to a value that causes the addition to underflow or overflow. This could result in unintended consequences or even loss of funds.


  Can you give me an example of how a user could exploit this? I'm specifically looking for something that would cause the under/overflow. I want to understand the attack surface better.

Also, how would you mitigate this attack? Is there anything I can do to make my code more secure?
I'm not looking to write a novel, just a few examples to help me understand. Thanks!





   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?  I have heard that python has the most job opportunities, but I don't know much about it.  Is python worth learning if I may not have jobs in it?   I am considering it because I heard a lot of people talking about how easy it was to use.   Please help!  Thank you!   Also, if there are other languages that are easier to start with, what are some of them?    Thank You!
