yes, it is.

The reason is that the `UnswapCaller` contract calls the Unswap `swap` function, which requires the WETH token to be approved for the transfer. Since the contract does not have access to the private key of the deployed WET token, the approval must be done by the user. Therefore, `msg.Sender` is data-dependent on `pair[n]`.


  How can I fix this?
 
  You can fix the issue by using the OpenZeppelin library to handle the token approvals for you. This will allow the smart contract to interact with the Ethereum blockchain directly and avoid the need for user interaction.
