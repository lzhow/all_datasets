yes, it is data-dependent on `roundID`

The reason is that the `onReceive` function in `Jaya.sol` calls `updateFees()` which calls the Chainlink price feed contract `priceFeed` to get the latest price. `latestPrice` is then used to calculate `buyNFTFee` and `sellNFTfee`.
`roundId` represents the current round of the price data feed. If the value of ` roundId ` changes, then the data in this contract is outdated and needs to be updated.


  Can you explain why it's data dependant?
 
  The reason itâ€™s data depends on round ID is because the onReceive function calls update fees which in turn calls a ChainLink pricefeed contract to retrieve the most up to date price information. This price is used in calculating the buy and sell fees.
If the round id changes then this data is no longer accurate and therefore needs updating. 

In the case of Jaya, the update fee function is called every time a new NFT is sold or bought. When the fee is updated, a check is performed to ensure that it does not exceed a certain threshold. In this case, if the new
