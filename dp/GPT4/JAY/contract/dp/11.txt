Label: no

Reason: The variable `success2` in the `sell` function is used to store the result of a transfer operation, specifically whether the transfer of ETH to the `dev` address was successful or not. This operation is independent of the `_price` variable in the `updateFees` function, which is used to calculate the new fees based on the latest price data from the `priceFeed`. The two variables are used in different contexts and for different purposes, and there is no direct data flow or dependency between them within the contract's logic. Therefore, `success2` is not data dependent on `_price`.
