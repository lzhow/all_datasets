In the `tryAdd` function, the value of `a` is passed as an argument, and the return value is a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded and a uint value representing the result of the addition.
Since the argument ` b` in ` tryadd`is not passed by reference,it is considered to be controlledby the contract.
