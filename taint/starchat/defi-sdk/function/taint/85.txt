   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!




An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application into a single file that can be served to the client's browser. This allows for faster page loads and reduces the number of requests that the browser needs to make to load the application.

When you build a website using a framework like React, you typically have many different JavaScript files, CSS files and image files. An incremental tool like Webpack takes all these files as input and generates a bundle of all of the code that will be needed by your application at runtime. It does this by analyzing the dependencies between the files so that it can determine what code needsto be included in each bundle and in what order. Additionally, Webpack can optimize the bundle by performing various code optimizations like minification and tree shaking. Finally, the tool
