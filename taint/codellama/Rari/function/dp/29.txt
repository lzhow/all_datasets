  
The label is 'No'.

Explanation:
In the `finishInteresAccural` function, the value of `interesstAcculated` is calculated using the current value `borrowRateManitssa` and `blockDelta`. The value is then used to calculate `totaBorrowNew`, which is a new value for the total borrows.
On the other hand, in `_SetReserverFacorFres`h`function, a value called `oldreservefactorMantiissa is assigned to the`reserFectorMantinssaa` variable. This value does not depend on any other variable in this function. Therefore, ` totalborrowsnew` doesnot dependon`newreservFectormantissaa`.
Therefore, The label for this question is "No".
