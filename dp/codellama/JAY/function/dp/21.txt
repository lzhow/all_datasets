In the `function` buy NFT, the total variable is calculated by adding the length of the erC 7 2 5 6 token address array and the return value of ` buy ERC`1 9 3 4 8  tokenAddress array.
  The ` amount` variable in ` function` ` buyerc  `195` is a local variable that is used to calculate the sum of all the amounts in` amounts` array, and it is not returned or used outside of this function. Therefore, ` total` and ` amounts ` are dependent on each other.
