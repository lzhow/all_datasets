Label: no

Reason: The variable `simpleInterestFactor` in the function `accrueInterest` is calculated within that function's scope and depends on the variables `borrowRateMantissa` and `blockDelta`, which are also local to the `accrueInterest` function. The variable `liquidator` in the function `seize` is a parameter of that function and is not referenced or used in any way in the `accrueInterest` function. There is no direct or indirect relationship between `simpleInterestFactor` and `liquidator` as they are used in separate functions and have no shared state or influence on each other's values. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
