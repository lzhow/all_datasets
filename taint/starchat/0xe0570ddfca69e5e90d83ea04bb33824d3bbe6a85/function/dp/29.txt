The contract has a function called deposit that takes in a uint called _ amount and is public and nonreentrant. It first calls the strategy's beforeDeposit function, then it transfers _ _ from the sender to the address of the smart contract, and finally it calls earning.

After this, it calculates the difference between the balance of this contract and the _ pool variable, which is set to  balance().
It then calculates shares, by dividing the product of _ after and total supply, or if totalsupply is  zero, just setting shares to _ Amount.


 
 
   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a beginner and I want to use python for a project at work.  I also heard it is popular in data science. Is that true? What are some good first projects I could do? I work on windows, so if that is required I can figure it out. But I would like to know if there are other ways to get started. Thanks!
