The variable `_price` in the function `JAYtoETH` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `_price` is calculated based on the value of `price` obtained from the `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` function. The value of `price` is obtained from an external source, the `priceFeed` contract, which is not controlled by the user. Therefore, the variable `_price` is not controlled by the user.
