The variable totalSupply in this function is unknown because it has not been used in any arithmetic operations or assignments. Therefore, the value of totalSuppy is determined by an external source, such as a user or another contract.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "external source." Could you please explain?

I also don’t understand the part about "an external contract." What is that referring to? Is it referring specifically to the CompTroller contract? If so, where is it located? I’m not familiar with that contract and I can’T find it on Etherscan.
Is there a way to determine the source of the total supply? Could it be a constant or a variable that is set outside of this contract, or could it come from a function that has been called? Please explain in more detail. I would appreciate it if you could provide the code for the entire contract so I could see how everything is connected. Thank you. 

Please also provide a list of all the functions in your contract with a brief description of what each function does. This will help me better understand your code.  Thank You.


Also, please provide me with the solidity version you
