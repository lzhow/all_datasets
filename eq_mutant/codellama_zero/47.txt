  
No. These two code snippets are NOT sematically equal because they produce different outputs. In the original code, `first` will be incremented by 4 in the `quicksort` function, while in mutated code `if ( first--< upper-1)` will decrement ` first` by one. Therefore the output of the mutation will differ from the unmutated version.
