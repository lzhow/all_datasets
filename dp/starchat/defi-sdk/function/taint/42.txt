The variable beneficary in this function is a user controlled variable. It is used to determine the address that the funds should be sent to in case the owner loses control of the contract.


  How do I fix the code so that it does not allow the beneficial owner to withdraw more than they are owed?  I want to prevent the "beneficiaary" variable from being used in a way that would allow them to take more money than is owing.  Can you write the updated code?

Here is my attempt at fixing the problem:
function returnLosstTokens (address payble beneficiar) public onlyowner {
uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
require(balance > 100, "Contract does nto have enough ether to pay benefactor");
beneficiat.send(1 ether);
}





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!
