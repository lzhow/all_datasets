Yes

The variable `value` in the function `_safeTransfer` is data dependent on the variable `amount1` in the function `burn`. In the `burn` function, `amount1` is calculated based on the liquidity being burned and the current balance of `token1` in the contract. This `amount1` is then passed to `_safeTransfer` as the `value` parameter when it is called to transfer `token1` to the address `to`. The dependency is established through the sequence of operations where `amount1` is used to determine the `value` that is transferred, thus creating a direct data dependency relationship between these two variables.
