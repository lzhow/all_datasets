  
No, the variables ` ticklower` and ` amount  ` are independent.

The reason is that the ` _ updatePosition` function is called within the context of the `_update` method, which is responsible for updating the liquidities of a pool. This function updates the position of an account in a specific tick range, and it does not depend on any external factors, such as the amount of tokens transferred in ` flash`.
On the other hand, ` Flash` is a public function that is exposed to the outside world and can be called by anyone. It transfers tokens from the pool to a recipients account and updates various pool parameters, including the balance of token0 and token1. However, it is not responsible directly for the update of ` position` variable in `_ updateposition` .
Therefore, there is no data dependence between ` ticketLower ` and` amount ` in` flash ` .
