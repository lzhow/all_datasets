  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the given code, the `whiltelist` variable is a mapping of type `address => bool` and it is not clear if it depends on `supllier`.
It is possible that the mapping is updated in other parts of the code that are currently not visible in this function.
Therefore, it cannot be determined whether `suplyCap` is data-dependent on`suppliers` or not.
