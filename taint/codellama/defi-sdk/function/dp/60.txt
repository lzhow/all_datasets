  
No, the state variable `_type_hash` is not dependent on ` account` variable in ` get_absolute_input_amount` function.

The reason is that the `_ type_ hash` state is defined outside the `function` and is used as a constant value. It is also not modified within the scope of the current function, so it is independent of any other variables. Therefore, it does not have any data dependence on any variable, including `Account`.
