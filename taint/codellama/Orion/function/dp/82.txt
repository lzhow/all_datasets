In the first function, the `sortTokes` function is called with `address` `factory`, ` address` token A, and ` token` B as arguments. This function returns a tuple containing two values: the sorted `tokens` and the corresponding `pair`. The ` pair` is then used to call the` getreserves` method of the Orion Pool V2 Pair contract.
  The`getreservers`method returns three values, which are assigned to three variables: ` reserve 0`,` reserve`1`, and`reserved`.
   The variables ` reserver0`and` reserv1` are then assigned values based on whether ` toke`n A is equal to `tok`en 1. If `t`oken A`is equal` to`tok'en`B`, then `re`served`0 is assigned the value of`re'ser`ved  `1`. Otherwise` ,` re`serv`ed`  1 is assig`ned the valu`e of ` re'serv'ed  '0`.  This means that the values of  the variables` reserved`A and  reserved B are dependent on each other.
