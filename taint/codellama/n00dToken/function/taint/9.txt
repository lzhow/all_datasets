  
No, the `_ TOKKN_ RECIPEINT_ INTERFAC_ HASH ` variable is a constant that is defined in a library and is therefore not user-controlled. It is set to a specific value and cannot be changed by any user input. Therefore, this variable should be labeled as 'No' because it does not depend on user inputs.
