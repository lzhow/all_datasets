Reason: In the Solidity contract provided, the `pools` contract state is a mapping that holds the state of each pool associated with a token address. The `setUserPool` function modifies the `userPoolData` mapping, which is another state variable that holds the user-specific data for each pool. The variable `_useAsCollateral` is used to update the `disableUseAsCollateral` property within the `userPoolData` mapping for a specific user and token.

Although the `pools` state itself is not directly modified by the `_useAsCollateral` variable within the `setUserPool` function, there is an indirect data dependency relationship between `pools` and `_useAsCollateral` because the `userPoolData` is likely to be related to the overall state of the pool, which is represented by `pools`. The `disableUseAsCollateral` flag could affect the user's ability to interact with the pool, such as borrowing or providing collateral, which in turn could affect the state of the pool (e.g., total borrows, total reserves, etc.).

Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship because changes to `_useAsCollateral` can influence the user's interaction with the pool, which is part of the overall state captured by `pools`.
