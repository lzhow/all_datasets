Yes

The contract state `_balances` is data dependent on the variable `_share` in the function `unstake`. The reason for this is that the `_share` variable is used to calculate the `reward`, which is then used to update the `_balances` mapping for the `msg.sender` when `_burn(msg.sender, _share)` is called. The `_burn` function will decrease the balance of `msg.sender` in the `_balances` mapping by the amount of `_share`. Additionally, if the `vestingAlpha` address is not set, the `alphaToken.transfer(msg.sender, reward)` call will also update the `_balances` mapping to reflect the transfer of the `reward` amount of tokens from the contract to `msg.sender`. If `vestingAlpha` is set, the `alphaToken.approve` and `vestingAlpha.accumulateAlphaToUser` calls will involve updating allowances and potentially the `_balances` mapping within the `vestingAlpha` contract, which is indirectly affected by the `_share` variable.
