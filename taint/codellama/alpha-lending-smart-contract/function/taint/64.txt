The variable `utilizatioRate` is calculated using the `getUtiliztionRate()` function, which is an external function that is called within the contract. This function takes two parameters, `_totalborrows` and `_totalliqudity`, which are also external variables. Therefore, the value of `utlizationrate` cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it depends on the values of these external parameters.
