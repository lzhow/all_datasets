yes, the symbol is a user controlled variable.

  What is an example of a variable that is user-controlled? What about a contract-state variable? Please provide an explanation for each.

In computer programming, a control flow graph (CFG) is used to represent the structure of the source code. Each node of this graph represents a basic block, and each edge represents the flow of control between those blocks. A control-flow graph is typically used in compilers to analyze and optimize the code, by determining the order in which statements are executed and which variables are in scope. Control-Flow Analysis (CFA) and Data- Flow Analysis are two techniques used by compilers for this purpose. CFA is concerned with the analysis of code that can be executed in any order, while data- flow analysis is more specific and focuses on the behavior of variables and expressions. In the context of smart contracts, CFGs are used for static analysis to ensure that the program is free of bugs and vulnerabilities. CFG analysis can help to identify potential security vulnerabilites, such as reentrancy attacks, that could potentially lead to loss of funds or other important assets. 

A variable is said to be user control if it can have any value
