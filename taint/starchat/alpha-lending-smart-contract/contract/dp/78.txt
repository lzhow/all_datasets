yes, because it is used to initialize the `altoken` variable in `LenderPool` contract.


  Can you explain why?
 
  The `_token.balanceOf(address(this))` expression in Lenderpool.calculateRoundupBorrowshareamount() function is data-dependent on `_totalborrows` and `_borrowshares` variables.

The `_user.balance` is also data dependend on these two variable. 

So the `_pool` struct is dependent on them. And the entire `_pools` array is depenedent on it. So the whole contract is dependant on this
