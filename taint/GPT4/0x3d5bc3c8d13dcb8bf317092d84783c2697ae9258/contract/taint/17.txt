Label: yes

Reason: The variable `cToken` in the function `repayBorrowVerify` is a parameter that is passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is external and does not have any restrictions on who can call it (such as `onlyOwner` or similar modifiers), any user can call this function and provide the `cToken` parameter. Therefore, the `cToken` variable is controlled by the user who calls the function.
