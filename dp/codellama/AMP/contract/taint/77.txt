  
No, the ` EC _5 3 _IN SUFF I C IENT _AL LOW A N C E` variable is a constant in this contract and is therefore not user-controlled. It is used to indicate an error condition in which the allowable amount of tokens is insufficient.

The `allowable` amount is determined by a combination of the `_allowed` mapping and the amount that has been approved by an operator. If the approved amount by any operator is less than the requested amount, then the transfer will fail with the error code `IN_SUFFIENT ALLOWANCE`.
This error is generated by solidty and not by user input. Therefore, this variable cannot be controlled or manipulated by users.
