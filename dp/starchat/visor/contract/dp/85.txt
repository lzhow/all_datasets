   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
  
Python is an interpreted, high- level and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.

"Python has become the language of choice for many people because it's easy to read and write, and it has a large and active community of programmers who use it to build applications and programs. Its syntax is simple and straightforward, making it easy for new programers to pick up and start using right away. Additionally, Python has many libraries and frameworks available that make it possible to accomplish a wide range of tasks with just a few lines of code."
