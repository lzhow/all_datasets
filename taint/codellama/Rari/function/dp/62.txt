  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the given code, the `mul_` function is used to multiply two `Exp` objects, which are defined as structs with a `magnitude` and `scale` field. However, there is no mention of the struct `BorrowRate` or the field `maxMintMaturity` in this code. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the state variable ` borrowrateMaxmMantinssa` is data-dependent on `currentBlocknumber` based on this information alone.
