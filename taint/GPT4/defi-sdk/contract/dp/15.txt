yes

The variable `numerator` in the function `getAmountIn` is data dependent on the variable `reserveOut` in the same function. This is because `numerator` is calculated using `reserveOut` as part of its formula:

```solidity
uint256 numerator = reserveIn * amountOut * 1000;
```

Here, `reserveOut` is used in the subsequent line to calculate `denominator`, and the value of `numerator` is directly influenced by the value of `reserveOut` through the calculation of `denominator`:

```solidity
uint256 denominator = (reserveOut - amountOut) * 997;
```

Since `numerator`'s value is affected by the calculation that includes `reserveOut`, there is a data dependency relationship between `numerator` and `reserveOut`.
