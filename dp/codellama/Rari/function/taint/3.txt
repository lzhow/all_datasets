  
The variable 'redemptionTokes' in function 'reddemAllowd' is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled directly by a user who calls the 'enterMarkts' function.

In the code, the `enterMakets` function takes an array of addresses as an argument, which can include the address of the contract that calls `redemmAllow` and `mintAllow`. The `isComtroller` variable is set to true, indicating that the calling contract is a Comtrollor. This means that a contract can call the functions ` mint` or ` redemm` directly, and the Comproller will check if these actions are allowed.
