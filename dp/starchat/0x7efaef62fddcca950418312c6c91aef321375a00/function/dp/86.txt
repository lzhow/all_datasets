The contract call in this function is a low-level call to an external contract, so it is not analyzed by the tool. However, the `_balances` mapping is updated in a similar way to the `balances`, so the answer is yes.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are determined?
 
  Yes, I can explain this further.

In Solidty, functions are executed sequentially, from top to bottom. When a function call is encountered, its body is executed, and any changes made to contract storage are committed. At the end of the call, control is passed back to where the original function was called. This means that any variables used in that function will have the most up-to-date value when the called function returns. 

When determining whether two contract variables have data dependence, we need to consider how they might be used by different parts of a program. For example, if a variable is used to store the result of an expensive computation, then it might have an indirect dependency on other variables that are used later in execution. On the other hand, a local variable that is only used within a single function would not have any dependences on variables outside of that scope. In general,
