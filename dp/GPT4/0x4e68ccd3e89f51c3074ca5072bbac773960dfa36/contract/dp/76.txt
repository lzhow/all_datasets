Reason: The variable `time` in the function `update` is an input parameter that represents the current block timestamp or another time value when the function is called. It is used to update the `info.secondsOutside` field within the `Tick.Info` struct for a specific tick if the `liquidityGrossBefore` is 0 and the tick is less than or equal to `tickCurrent`.

On the other hand, the variable `info` in the function `cross` is a reference to a specific `Tick.Info` struct associated with a given tick index within the mapping `self`. The function `cross` updates several fields within the `info` struct, including `info.feeGrowthOutside0X128`, `info.feeGrowthOutside1X128`, `info.secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128`, `info.tickCumulativeOutside`, and `info.secondsOutside`, using the current global values and subtracting the stored `outside` values.

The variable `time` in `update` is independent of the `info` struct in `cross`. They are used in different contexts and for different purposes within their respective functions. The `time` parameter is not derived from, nor does it influence, the `info` struct in `cross`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `time` in `update` and `info` in `cross`.
