  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_bal` variable is compared to the value of `_feemargin` which is calculated by subtracting `_beta` from `_delta`. The `_bet` and `_delt` variables are both parameters of the `calcuateFemicro` function. Therefore, `_femarg` is data-dependent on `_b`et`a`and `_`d`e`l`t``.
Similarly, in function 2,`_thresh`old`is calculated as` _`i`deal`.`mul`( `ONE` + `_be`ta`). Therefore` `_t `h`r`es`hold` i`s data` dependent on` ` _i `d `eal`, and the same is true for the second function as well.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on their parameters.
