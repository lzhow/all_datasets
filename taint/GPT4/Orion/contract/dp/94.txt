Reason: The variable `amountIn` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is calculated based on the return value of the function `_doSwapTokens`, which is called within `doSwapThroughOrionPool`. The variable `i` in the function `_swap` is a loop index used for iterating over the `path` array within that function. The value of `amountIn` is determined before the function `_swap` is called and is not modified by the loop index `i` within `_swap`. The loop index `i` is used locally within the `_swap` function to perform token swaps along the path, but it does not have a direct data dependency relationship with the `amountIn` variable from `doSwapThroughOrionPool`. The `amountIn` is an input to `_swap` and is used to determine the amounts for swapping, but it is not dependent on the loop index `i` itself.
