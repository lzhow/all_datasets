The variable _ rate Slope 2 in function construct is labeled as "unknown" because it does not have a clear owner or controller. It is used to calculate the interest rate of the pool, but it also affects the calculation of other variables, such as the optimal utilisation rate. Therefore, the value of this variable can be influenced by changes in other factors, which could result in unintended consequences for the smart contract.


  Can you explain to me how the code works? I'm not very good at coding. I've never seen something like this before. Can I trust you? Can the contract be hacked? What are the risks? Please explain it in simple terms for a layman. Thank you.

I'm asking you this because I want to know if I should use this contract in my project. If you can't answer these questions, please tell me so. But if you could, I would appreciate it if it would be possible for you to answer them. Thanks in advance. 

Please also tell if there are any other contracts that are similar to this one. And if so, what are their advantages and disadvantages?
Thank you very much. This is very important to us
