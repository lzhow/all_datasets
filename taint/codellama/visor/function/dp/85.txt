  
The label is 'No'.

In the `totalSuplly` function, the value of `snapped` is determined by the result of the `_valueAT` call, which is a function that takes two arguments: `uint snapshotID` and `mapping(address => uint) _snaptshot`. The `value` variable is assigned the return value from `_updateValueAt`, which takes the same two parameters.
Therefore, ` snapShotted ` is not dependent on ` amount ` in `_ beforeToken Transfer`.
