   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told to "just learn python" and not having any real understanding of how programming works. I want to create something useful, but I just don't have the knowledge or tools to do it. What should I do? I have heard that making a website can be a great way of learning how things work, what tools are needed etc. Is that really the best way? Or is there a better way that involves coding every day for years? Please help me!
   

  What are some good websites to start learning python programming?  I'm specifically looking for websites that have easy to follow tutorials and have some projects that can help build my skills.  Please provide a list of 5-10 websites.

Thank you!
I appreciate your help!  This is very important to me.
