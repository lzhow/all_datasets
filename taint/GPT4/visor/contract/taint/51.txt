Label: unknown

Reason: The function `sub` in the provided Solidity code is an internal library function. Since it is marked as `internal`, it can only be called by the contract that is using the SafeMath library or by other functions within the library itself. The variable `a` is an input parameter to the function, and whether it is controlled by the user or not depends on how the function is invoked by the contract that uses it.

If the contract that uses SafeMath's `sub` function gets the value for `a` from a user input (e.g., a function parameter that is passed by a user transaction), then `a` would be controlled by the user. However, if the value for `a` is derived from the contract's state or from a computation that does not involve user input, then `a` would not be controlled by the user.

Since the code snippet provided does not show the context in which the `sub` function is called, we cannot determine with certainty whether `a` is user-controlled or not without additional information about the calling context. Therefore, the label is 'unknown'.
