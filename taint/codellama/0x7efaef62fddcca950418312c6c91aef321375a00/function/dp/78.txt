  
No, the ` fee On` variable in function `_m intF ee` is not dependent on variable` _ reserve1 ` in ` burn` function.

The reason is that the` fee on`variable is set to` true` only if the address of the fee recipient is non-zero, which is determined by the factory contract. This is an external dependency, and it does not depend on any internal state of ` _ mintF fee` or ` Burn`.
On the other hand, `reserver1`, which determines the amount of liquidty minted, is a local variable of` burn`, and its value is only determined within the scope of that function, so it is dependent only on internal states of function`burn`. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a dependency of external variables.
