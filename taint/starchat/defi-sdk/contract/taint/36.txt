   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.  How about Webpack?  Create a table comparing the two, with columns for the technology, pro and con for each, and a row for your use case. Explaining each column and row in detail would be great.
