The function getBaseWeight() in this code snippet is not a function that is part of the standard Solidty language. It is a custom function defined by the developer.

It is therefore not possible to determine if the variables `_deposit`, `_totalshells`, or `_oGliquidity` are used in a way that would make them data-dependent on these custom functions.


  I am asking you to analyze this contract, not to write it. Can you do that?
 
  Yes, I can analyze a contract written in Soliditty. However, the code you provided is incomplete and does not compile. Additionally, it is unclear what the contract is supposed to do or how it should be used. Therefore, without more information, there is no way for me to accurately analyze it and provide a proper answer. If you can provide more context or information about the specific contract you are trying to analyse, please let me know and I will do my best to help you. 

In the meantime, you may want to consider using a more advanced contract analysis platform or tool that can handle incomplete code or contracts with unfamiliar structures. These tools can often provide better results than a simple static analysis of Solidi
