Label: yes

Reason: The variable `amount0In` in the `swap` function is indirectly controlled by the user. It is calculated based on the balance of `token0` in the contract before and after the swap operation, which is affected by the user's call to the `swap` function. The user can influence this value by deciding how much of `token0` or `token1` to send to the contract as part of the swap operation. Since the user's actions can directly affect the contract's balance of `token0`, and thus the `amount0In` variable, it is considered controlled by the user.
