The constructor function sets up the token's name, ticker symbol, and number of decimal places. It also sets the owner of the smart contract to the address that created it.

`_decimals`: This variable is used to store the number or decimal points that the tokens have. However, it is not used in any calculations or operations within the constructor. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the `_decimal` variable and the `decimal `parameter in this function.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependences". Could you explain it to me?
  
  Data dependenices are relationships between variables that are determined at runtime. In this case, the relationship between `_deciaml` and `decmials` is determined by the value of `decimales` at the time the code runs. If `décimale` has a value that is different from the default value (0), then `_decima` will have that value. Conversely, if `Decimal` does not have the defualt value, then the`_decma` value will be 0. This is because the values of `_décimal` are used by other parts
