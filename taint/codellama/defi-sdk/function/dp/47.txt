  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `amountOut` variable is calculated using the formula: `return numer / denom`. The `num` and `dem` variables are both calculated based on `reservesIn`and `reveresOut`, which are also calculated in this function. Therefore, ` numer` is data-dependent on`denom` because it is derived from the same data.
Similarly, in function two,`amountout`is calculated with the`numer`variable, which is also datadependenton`dem`.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies between the variables `number` `and` denominators`.
