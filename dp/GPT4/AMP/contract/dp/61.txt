Label: no

Reason: The contract state `AMP_TOKENS_CHECKER` is a string constant that represents an interface name used for ERC1820 registry. It is defined as a constant value and does not change throughout the contract. On the other hand, the variable `index` in the function `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions` is a local variable used to manage the indices within the `_totalPartitions` array and the `_indexOfTotalPartitions` mapping. The `index` variable is used to help remove a partition from the `_totalPartitions` array and update the mapping accordingly. There is no interaction or dependency between the `AMP_TOKENS_CHECKER` constant and the `index` variable; they serve completely different purposes within the contract and their values are not related. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
