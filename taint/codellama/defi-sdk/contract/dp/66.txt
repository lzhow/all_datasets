  
No, the `account_signatue_typehash` contract is not dependent on `Input` variable in ` validateAccountExpirationSignatures` function.

The `Account_Signatute_Typehash ` contract variable is defined in a different contract, and it is used to store the typehash of the account signature. It is a constant value that is set when the smart contracts are deployed, so it does not depend on any variable or state of any function in this contract.
