The variable `erc1155Amounts` in the function `buyJay` is not data dependent on the variable `price` in the function `updateFees`. 

Reason: The variable `erc1155Amounts` is used as an input parameter for the `buyJay` function, and its value is determined by the caller of the function. On the other hand, the variable `price` in the `updateFees` function is obtained from the `priceFeed` contract, which is an external data source. There is no direct assignment or computation between these two variables, indicating that they are not data dependent.
