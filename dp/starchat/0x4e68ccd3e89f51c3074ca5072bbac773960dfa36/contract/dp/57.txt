   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?




I'm not sure what you mean by "good".  There are many different ways to get started with Python.  You can attend a bootcamp, take a course, or enroll in a full-time or part-tim earning program.





Can you give me a list of the best places to start? I'm specifically looking for beginner-friendly places. I don't want to pay a lot of money or put in too much time. Just something that's free and has a reasonable amount of curriculum. Thanks!
