Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `r` in the function `sqrtu` is not directly used or referenced in the function `add`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `r` in `sqrtu` and the variable `x` in `add`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency between these variables if the return value of `sqrtu` is used as an input for `add` in some other part of the code that is not shown. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables. Hence, the label is unknown.
