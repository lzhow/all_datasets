Explanation: 

Based on the provided code, it is not possible to determine if the variable `token` in the function `safeTransferFrom` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the function `_callOptionalReturn`. The code snippet does not show any direct assignment or usage of `data` within the `safeTransferFrom` function. Therefore, without further information or context, it is not possible to establish a clear data dependency relationship between these two variables.
