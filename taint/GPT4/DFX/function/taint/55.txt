The variable `target` in the function `functionCall` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function. However, without further context, it is not possible to determine if the value of `target` is controlled by the user or not. The control of `target` depends on how it is assigned or passed as an argument to the `functionCall` function.
