  What is a user control variable?  How does the program know that?   What are some examples of user-controlled variables?

User-control refers to the ability of a program to control the value of variables. This is in contrast to a system-generated variable, which is generated by a computer program and cannot be modified by users.
A user can control a variable by changing its value. For example, a person can change the contents of an array or the values of individual elements in an object. In some cases, users can also control variables indirectly by modifying the behavior of the computer system. These variables are often referred to as "hidden variables" or "latent variables."
In some programming languages, variables can be declared as being user or system controlled, and the programmer can use this information to ensure that the system does not allow unauthorized access to user variables or to prevent unintended consequences of changing a value that is used by other parts of code. Some programming environments also provide tools for tracking and controlling the use of system resources, such as memory and CPU time.
