Label: yes

Reason: The variable `self` in the function `write` refers to an array of `Observation` structs that is being modified by the function. The `write` function takes several parameters, including `tick`, and uses them to update an `Observation` within `self`. The `tick` parameter specifically influences the `tickCumulative` field of the new `Observation` created by the `transform` function, which is then stored in `self`.

In the `observe` function, the `tick` parameter is used to retrieve and calculate cumulative tick values based on the observations stored in `self`. Since `write` modifies `self` using `tick`, and `observe` reads from `self` and uses `tick` for calculations, there is a data dependency relationship between the variable `self` in `write` and the variable `tick` in `observe`. Changes to `tick` in `write` will affect the values read and calculated in `observe`, demonstrating the data dependency.
