  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `dip()` function, the value of `toDripped`, which is calculated using the expression `min(a, b)`, is dependent on `resevoirbalace_`, `drpRate`, and `blockNumber`.
`reserveBalace` is a contract variable that is not modified in this function.
Therefore, `b` and the return value `deltaDrop` are dependent variables.
