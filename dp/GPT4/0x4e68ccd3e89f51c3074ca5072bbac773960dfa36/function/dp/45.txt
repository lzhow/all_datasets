Label: yes

Reason: The variable `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s` is assigned values within the for loop by calling the `observeSingle` function. The `observeSingle` function is passed the `liquidity` variable as an argument, which implies that the output of `observeSingle` (and thus the values assigned to `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s`) could be dependent on the value of `liquidity`. Since `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s` is directly populated based on the result of a function that takes `liquidity` as a parameter, there is a data dependency relationship between `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128s` and `liquidity`.
