Reason: The variable `amount0` in the function `burn` is calculated based on the contract's balance of `_token0`, the `liquidity` owned by the contract, and the `totalSupply` of the LP tokens. It is not directly influenced by the variable `_token1` in the function `swap`. The variable `_token1` in `swap` is used to perform token transfers and to check the validity of the `to` address, but it does not affect the calculation or the value of `amount0` in the `burn` function. The two variables operate in different contexts and their computations are independent of each other.
