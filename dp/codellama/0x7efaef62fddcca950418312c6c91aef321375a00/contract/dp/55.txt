  
No, the variables ` token` and `_ reserve  ` are independent in function `_safe Transfer` because the ` _ safeTransfe` function is called with the arguments `address` `to` , `uint` amount `, and `bytes` memory `data` . The `amount` argument is not used in `_ safe Transfer`, so it does not depend on `_ reserves`.

The ` to` variable is also independent of `_ reserved` since it is passed as an argument to `_ safetransfer` without being modified.
