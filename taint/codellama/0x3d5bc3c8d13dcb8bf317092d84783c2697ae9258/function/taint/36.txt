  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `seizeCalculationSeizedTockens` function, the parameter `repaymentAmount` is passed in as an argument. This means that the value of `repaidAmount ` is determined by an external user, and it can be manipulated by a malicious user to cause the contract to behave in an unexpected way. Therefore, ` ctokenCollatoral ` in this function is considered to be controlled  by user and labeled as ' Yes'.
