The two provided codes snippets are **not** semantic equivalent. While the first code snippet implements the bubble sort algorithm, the second snippet contains a type conversion error which causes the loop to never terminate and the function to throw a `StackOverflowError`.

Additionally, neither of the snippets properly initializes the array `data` before calling the sort function, which can result in unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
