Explanation: The variable `pool` in the function `get_xp` is data dependent on the variable `coins` in the same function. This is because the `coins` variable is used as an argument in the function `ICurveRegistry(factory).get_coins(pool)`, which means the value of `pool` affects the result of the function call. Therefore, there is a data dependency between `pool` and `coins`.
