  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `transerFrom` function, the `_approval` method is called with the arguments `sender`, `_msgSend()`, and `_allowance[ sender][ _ msgSender ()]. sub (amount,"ER2C:transferred amount execeedsallowanace")`. The ` _ allowances` variable is used in this call.
Similarly, in ` decreaseAllownace` , the` _ approval ` method  is also called, but with different arguments. Specifically, it is passed the variables `spende` and ` subtratedValue`.
Therefore, ` amount` is data-dependent on ` subtractValue ` because it uses the same variable `_ allowanaces` as ` decreasAllwnace`.
