Explanation: The variable `mathErr` in the function `mintAllowed` is not directly dependent on the variable `borrowBalance` in the function `liquidateBorrowAllowed`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `borrowBalance` in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the data dependency between these two variables cannot be determined based on the given code.
