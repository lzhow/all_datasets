Label: no

Reason: The variable `_symbol` is a private state variable in the ERC20 contract, which means it is not directly accessible by external users or contracts. It is set once during contract deployment in the constructor and does not have a public setter function that allows for its modification. Only the contract's internal functions can access and potentially modify `_symbol`, but as per the given code, there is no functionality provided to change `_symbol` after the contract has been deployed. Therefore, `_symbol` is not controlled by the user.
