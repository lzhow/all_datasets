  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the given code, the `upgradeto` function is defined as an external function, which means that it can be called from outside the contract. This function takes an `address` parameter called ` newimplementation` as input.
Since the input parameter is an address, and the address is a user-controlled variable, we can conclude that the new implementation is user controlled. Therefore, in this case, `yes` is returned.
