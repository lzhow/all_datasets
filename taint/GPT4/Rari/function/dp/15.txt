No, the variable `vars` in the function `redeemFresh` is not data dependent on the variable `allowed` in the function `repayBorrowFresh`. 

The reason is that there is no direct assignment or usage of `allowed` in the code block of `redeemFresh`. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
