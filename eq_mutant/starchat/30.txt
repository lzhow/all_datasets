No. These codes do not have semantic equivalence. While the inputs of these codes may be similar (their arrays are swapped), the outputs of them are different. For example, in the first code, `return x;` is after two assignments to x and thus has the value of the second assignment to ` x`. In the mutated code ` return  x++;`, after the assignments the program jumps to the increment expression before it returns, so the returned value is actually one less than the expected one.
