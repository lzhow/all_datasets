I apologize if my earlier message was not clear. Here is how I would answer the example:
 - The first program and its mutated version can be classified as semantic equivalent because they both compute the median of an unsorted integer array. This algorithm depends on the input array, which is unpredictable, but the program does not change its behavior based on input data; it only rearranges the arithmetic operations in the code. Therefore the output of both the original and mutants code is same.
