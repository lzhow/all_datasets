The contract state `_indexOfTotalPartitions` is data dependent on the variable `toPartition` in the function `_transferByPartition`. This is because `toPartition` is used to determine if a new partition needs to be added to `_totalPartitions` and subsequently update `_indexOfTotalPartitions` to reflect the new index of the partition within the array. The relevant code snippet is:

```solidity
bytes32 toPartition = PartitionUtils._getDestinationPartition(_data, _fromPartition);
...
if (_indexOfTotalPartitions[_partition] == 0) {
    _addPartitionToTotalPartitions(_partition);
}
...
```

In the above code, `toPartition` is calculated and then used in the condition to check if the partition index is zero in `_indexOfTotalPartitions`. If it is zero, it means that the partition is not yet in `_totalPartitions`, and the `_addPartitionToTotalPartitions` function is called, which will modify `_indexOfTotalPartitions` by adding a new entry for `toPartition`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `_indexOfTotalPartitions` and `toPartition`.
