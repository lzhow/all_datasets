  
The label is 'No'.

In the `updateDevwallet` function, the `_ address` variable is assigned a new value, which is not dependent on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in ` buy ERC 771`, the` _ tokenAddress ` variable stores the address of an ER7C1 token contract, and the value of this variable can be changed by calling the contract's `safe TransferFrom` method. However, this method does not affect the state of the current contract or the variables in it. Therefore, `_ tokenaddress ` is independent of `_ Address` .
Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is "No".
