  
The variable 'admin' in this function is labeled as 'Yes' because it can be controlled or modified by a user in several ways.

Firstly, the 'constructor' function initializes the contract with an 'address' type variable called 'msg'. This variable is set to the address of the sender of a transaction, which is typically a human user interacting with the smart contract. Therefore, ' admin' is initialized with a value that is under the control of an external user, making it controlled.
