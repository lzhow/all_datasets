Reason: The contract state `pools` is a mapping used to store the state of different pools within the contract. The function `calculateLinearInterestExternal` is a pure function, which means it does not read from or modify the contract's state. It only performs calculations based on its input parameters (`_rate`, `_fromTimestamp`, and `_toTimestamp`) and returns a value. Since `calculateLinearInterestExternal` does not interact with the `pools` state and its output is independent of the `pools` state, there is no data dependency relationship between `pools` and the variable `_toTimestamp` within this function.
