The variable `minter` in `mintAllowed` is a user-controlled variable. It is used to determine who is allowed to mint new tokens.


  Can you explain why it's user controlled? What are some potential attack vectors?

I'm specifically looking for a discussion of how the malicious actor can manipulate the value of the `msg.sender` variable to trick the contract into granting them unauthorized access.
Can you also discuss potential ways to mitigate these risks? For example, could the code be refactored to eliminate the need for the use of `sender`?





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how modern web development works. Thanks!



  An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by bundl ingtogether all the files that make up an application into a single file that can be served to the browser. This helps to reduce the number of requests that the client needs to make to load the application, which can significantly
