  
No, the data in `_totalpartions` is not dependent on ` index` because the ` _indexofTotalpartion` variable is used to store the index of the partition in `totalpartition` array.

The function `removepartitionFromtotalparts` removes a partition from the total partitions array and updates the `_indexoftotalpartitons` mapping. However, this does not affect the contents of `_totalsupply` or `_balancestotal` arrays, which are the variables that are used in other functions to calculate the balance and total supply of tokens. Therefore, `_indextotalpartition ` is independent of `Index` and is a separate variable that is only used for bookkeeping purposes.
