The contract function 'burn' has a 'data dependency' relationship with the two contract variables: '_balances' (the balances mapping) and the 'amount' variable.

In the case of the '_burn()' function, the first parameter ('account') is derived from the second parameter 'balances'.
Therefore, in this case, '_balance' is a dependent variable on 'amout'.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "data dependecy relationship". Could you please explain it to me?
  
  Data dependency is when one variable or value depends on another variable, or when a change in one value affects another value. In the context of smart contracts, data dependencies are created when two or more variables are used together in a calculation or function. For example, if a variable 'x' depends upon a value stored in another varible 'y', then 'X' becomes a dependency of 'Y'. If 'Z' changes, 'z' will also change.
