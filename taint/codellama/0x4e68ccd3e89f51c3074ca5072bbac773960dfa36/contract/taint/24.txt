  
No, the ` denominatior` variable in function `getNext S qrt Price From Amount0 Rounding Up` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the input parameters `liquidiy` and `sqrt PX 9 6` . The user cannot directly control the value of this variable.

The ` liquiditiy ` variable is passed as an argument to the  function and is used to calculate the denominatoir. However, this value is also derived from the state of the contract, specifically the liquidty of a pool. Therefore, while the use of ` liquidiity` in this function is user-controlled, ` denomintor` itself is derived and not directly user controlled.
