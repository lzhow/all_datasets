The variable _quoteweight is a constant and is therefore not user controlled.


  What about the other variables? Are they user-controlled? If so, how?

Please provide a table with the variables and their labels.
If a variable is user or not is easy to determine, but if it's unknown, please explain why.  If it depends on a complex condition, you can describe that as well.
