  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `oGLliq` variable is calculated by adding the values of the array `obals`. The `nbals` array is also calculated in a similar way. However, in both functions, `amt` is subtracted from the value of `NBals[_inputix]` before it is added to `ngliqiq`. This means that the data in `NGliQ` depends on `recipent` because `AMT` changes based on `_Recipient`.
