Both codes provide the square root of a number to a given epsilon of approximation. While the first code will loop until the approximation meets or surpasses the epsilon, the second will continue to loop while the difference is epsilon. The resulting values will be the exact same, but the loop control will differ.

Yes, these two code blocks are in fact semantic equal, meaning that their behaviour and output will behave identically given equivalent inputs.
