Reason: The variable `_amount` in the `_transfer` function of the `AlToken` contract represents the amount of tokens that a user wants to transfer from one address to another. This variable is an input parameter to the function and is supplied by the user who initiates the transfer. Therefore, `_amount` is controlled by the user.
