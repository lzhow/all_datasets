Reason: The variable `mathErr` in the function `accrueInterest` is used to capture the result of mathematical operations within that function. It is a local variable scoped within the `accrueInterest` function and is used to handle errors that may occur during the calculation of interest rates, interest accumulation, and updates to the borrow index and reserves.

On the other hand, the variable `error` in the function `liquidateBorrowInternal` is used to capture the return value of the `accrueInterest` function call and the `cTokenCollateral.accrueInterest` function call. It is also a local variable scoped within the `liquidateBorrowInternal` function.

Since `mathErr` and `error` are local variables within their respective functions, they do not share state or influence each other's values. The value of `mathErr` is determined by the operations within `accrueInterest`, while the value of `error` is determined by the success or failure of the `accrueInterest` function calls. There is no direct data dependency between `mathErr` and `error`.
