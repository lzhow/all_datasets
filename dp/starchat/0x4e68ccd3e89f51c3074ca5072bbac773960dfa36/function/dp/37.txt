   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how. I want to do something useful with it, like make a game or something. But I also don't want it to be a waste of time. What do you recommend?

Can you give me some good advice? Or at least some ways I can learn without spending all my time on it? Thanks!
