Explanation :
In the swap function, the liquiditNet variable is calculated using the amount specified variable.
liquitity Net = tics. cross( step .tick Next, ( zero For One ? State .feegrowtheGlobal X1 2 8  : FeeGroth Global 9 X 6 ), ( Zero For one ? FEE Grow th e Global X6 3 5 : State. FEEGrow the Global x 7  ), Cache. secondsperliquitycumulativ x10  , Cache . tick cumulative , cache . blocktimestamp )
If the zero for one variable in step is true, then the first argument of the tic. Cross function is step tick next, which is dependent on amount Specified. Therefore, Liqutity net is data-dependent on Amount Specifed.
