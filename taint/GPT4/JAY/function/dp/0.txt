Explanation: The variable `success2` in the function `sell` is data dependent on the variable `value` in the same function. This is because the value of `eth` is calculated based on the value of `value` using the `JAYtoETH` function. The value of `eth` is then used to calculate the value of `success2` by dividing it with 33. Therefore, any change in the value of `value` will affect the value of `success2`.
