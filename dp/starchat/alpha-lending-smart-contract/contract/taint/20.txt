   What is an easy J Perm PLL algorithm?

A J-PLL algorithm is any algorithm that solves a Rubik's Cube using the J, P, and L moves. J and P are the basic algorithms of the cube, while L is often used as a twist to make the algorithm easier to solve.
There are many different JP-LL algorithms, but some of them are particularly easy to learn and understand. Here are some examples:
- Roux and Ruy Lopez: This algorithm starts by solving the white cross, then the yellow cross and finally the green cross. This is done by first solving a white-white-yellow-green J shape, followed by a yellow-orange-red-blue P shape and a final L shape. Rather than using a L, some people prefer to use a R' U R U' R2 U2 R to achieve the same effect.  This method is easy for beginners to understand and can be done in under 30 seconds. However, the Rox and the Loops algorithms are not considered
