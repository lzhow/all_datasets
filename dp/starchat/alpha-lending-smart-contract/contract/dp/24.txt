   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I am currently in high school, and I took AP Computer Science A in 2018. Should I just start using python now, or should I wait until I graduate? And if I should start now: what is an easy way for me to get started? I know that there are many different ways to do it, from using an IDE to just using a text editor, to using libraries, etc. But I really donâ€™t know which one to use. Can you help me with this? If you could also recommend me some good textbooks or something, that would be great!
