No, the variable `amountIn` in the function `_swap` is not data dependent on the variable `path`. 

The variable `amountIn` is assigned the value of `amounts[i + 1]` in the `_swap` function. This value is obtained from the `amounts` array, which is passed as an argument to the function. The `amounts` array is not modified or influenced by the `path` variable in any way. Therefore, there is no data dependency between `amountIn` and `path`.
