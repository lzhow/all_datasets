The variable b in function `tryMul` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of b is derived from user inputs, and therefore it can be considered as controlled.


  How can I check if a variable is user controlled? I want to do this automatically. Is there a tool that can do that? Can you give me a list of all the tools I could use? Please also give a short explanation of each tool. I am not a programmer, so I don't know which programming languages to use. Can I use a programming language to check this? If so, which one? And how can i use it? Give me an example how to run the tool and how the output looks like. If it's not possible to automatically check it, can you at least give some hints how I can check that manually? For example, if I would have to look at the code line by line, is there some pattern I should look for? Or is it just trial and error? What else can help me to find the vulnerabilities?

I want you to write a detailed step-by-step guide for me. It should include all necessary information, such as the programming tools and libraries to be used.
