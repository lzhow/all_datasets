The variable `notEnterd` in function `False` is unknown to the tool as it does not follow the naming convention for user-controlled variables.


  What is a naming conventions for variables?  What does it mean if a variable is "user-controllable"?
  
  A naming convension is used to define the rules for the names of variables, functions, and other user defined items in a program.  The naming rules are used by developers to make it easier to understand and use the code.  

  A variable that is user controllable means that the value of the varible can be changed by a user of a software program at runtime.   

  For example, if you have a function that calculates the square root of an input value, you might want to allow the users of your program to specify the input to that function. In that case, the name of that input variable should be chosen carefully to clearly indicate that it can changed at run time.

  Naming conventions are important because they help to create a consistent and easy to use interface for your users. By using a common naming scheme, your code will be easier for them to read and understand.

In summary, naming convections are rules used
