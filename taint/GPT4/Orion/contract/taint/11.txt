Explanation: The variable `reserve1` in the function `_swap` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is assigned the value of `reserve1` from the `getReserves()` function call. The value of `reserve1` is determined by the state of the contract and is not influenced by user input. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
