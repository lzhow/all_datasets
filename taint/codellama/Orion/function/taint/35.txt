  
No, the ` amountOptimial` variable in function `_addliquidty` is NOT controlled  by user because it's calculated based on the input parameters `reserves` and `desired` amounts.

The `OrinMultiPollLibrary` contract is used to calculate the optimal amount of tokens to be added to the liquidty pool. This calculation is based solely on information available in `IOrnionPooV1Factory` which is a trusted contract. Therefore, `amoutOptinal` cannot be controlled directly by a user and is considered safe.
