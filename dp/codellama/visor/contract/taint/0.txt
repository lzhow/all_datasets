  
The variable _ visor in function contructor is labeled as 'No'.

This is because the constructor function takes two arguments, _visor and _ vvisor, which are passed in as arguments when the contract is deployed. These arguments are not user-controlled, but rather are provided by whoever deploys the smart contract. Therefore, the value of _ visitor is determined by external factors and is therefore not under the control of the end-user.
