In the `tryMUL` function, the value of `a` and `b` are passed as arguments, and the result is stored in `C`. The value `A` is a user-controlled variable, but the addition operation is performed on it with a constant value, which is also a known value. Therefore, `B` cannot be controlled directly by a malicious user, as it has a fixed value that is known to the contract.
