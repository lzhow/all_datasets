  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `current` function is a view function, which means that it does not modify the state of the contract. Therefore, any changes made to the `_value` variable within the scope of this function are not reflected in any other part of code.
Since the changes are local to this scope, they are controlled only by this contract and not by any user input.
