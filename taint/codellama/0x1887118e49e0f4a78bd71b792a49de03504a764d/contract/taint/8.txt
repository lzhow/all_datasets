  
No, the ` i` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is created by Soliidty compiler and it cannot be modified by users.

The ` constructor` function in Solidiy is a special function that' s called when a contract is deployed. It'S used to initialize the contract' 's state and set up any initial values. In this case, `  i ` is used as a loop counter to iterate over the arrays of `underliings` and `oracless` passed as arguments to the constructor. However, since ` `is` a  local  variable, its value cannot  be changed by  users, and its scope is limited to  the  `contructor`function. Therefore,  it  is considered  as  not  controlled   by   the   user .
