  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the code, the `nGLliq` variable is calculated by adding up the values of the elements in `oBali` and `nbali`. The `one` element in these arrays is set to the value of `amt` minus the balance of `_assem` at the beginning of each iteration of a for loop. Therefore, `on` is data-dependent on `_outpuIxi` because it is affected by the change in `_inputix` during each loop iteration.
