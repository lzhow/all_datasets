Label: yes

Reason: The variable `amount1Out` in the `swap` function is an argument provided by the caller of the function. Since the `swap` function is marked as `external`, it can be called by any user of the smart contract, and the user can pass any value they choose for `amount1Out`. Therefore, `amount1Out` is controlled by the user.
