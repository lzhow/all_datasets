  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `aAdjuted` variable is data-dependent on `time` because it is calculated as ` a> time? a: a+ 1<<31`.
Similarly, in function  ` l te`, the  variable  b Adjust is also data - dependent on time because  it  is   calculated  as  'b>time? b: b+1 <<30'.  Therefore,  the variables  a Adjut and b  Adju are  data  dependent  on  time.
