   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to read and write code with, and that it is widely used in industry. However, I've never coded before and I don't know much about the specifics of python syntax. I also heard it can be hard to debug code, but I'm not sure if that's true. What do you recommend? Should I start with a course on python, or should I learn it from scratch? I'd appreciate any recommendations you have!
   

  What are some good ways to start learning how code?  I am a college student who has no prior experience with coding.  What steps should i take to become proficient in coding? Please provide a step by step process and some resources that I can use to help me along the way. Thank you.

I have also checked online forums and have found that many people have had success starting out by learning the basics of HTML and CSS before moving on to more advanced coding languages. Is this the best approach, as you
