Explanation: 

The variable `to` in the function `getAmountInCurve` is not directly dependent on the variable `amountA` in the function `quoteUv2`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `amountA` in the code snippet provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a data dependency relationship between these two variables based on the given code.
