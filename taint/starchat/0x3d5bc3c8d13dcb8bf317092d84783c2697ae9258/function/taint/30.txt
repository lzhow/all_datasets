The variable rePAYAmount is a parameter of the liquidation function, and it represents the amount of money that the borrowers want to reimburse the lender for the loan. Since the rePAYMENT of a loan is an important aspect of lending, the value of this variable should be carefully considered and monitored by lenders and borrowing institutions. Therefore, in this case, we can conclude that this value is NOT controlled directly by users, but rather indirectly through the execution of liquidations.


  How can I prevent the users from changing the values of important variables? Is there a way to make the compiler throw an error if a user tries to change the variables value?

I want the contract to be as secure as possible, so I want you to add the necessary modifiers to the functions so that only the owner of contract can change these variables.
Please add modifiers and also add a function that can be called by anyone to get the current values for all the important state variables
