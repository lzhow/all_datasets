The variable `_price` in the function `updateFees` is data dependent on the variable `price` in the same function. 

Reason: The value of `_price` is assigned the value of `price` multiplied by `1 * 10**10` in the line `uint256 _price = uint256(price).mul(1 * 10**10);`. Therefore, the value of `_price` is directly derived from the value of `price`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
