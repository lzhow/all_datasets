Label: unknown

Reason: The variable `EQUILIBRIUM` is not explicitly defined in the provided Solidity contract code snippet. Since the code does not include the declaration or definition of `EQUILIBRIUM`, nor does it show the context in which it might be used, it is impossible to determine whether it is controlled by the user or not. Therefore, without additional information or the complete contract code, the control over the variable `EQUILIBRIUM` remains unknown.
