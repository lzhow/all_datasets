Label: Yes

Reason: The function `calculateLinearInterestExternal` is marked as `external` and takes parameters `_rate`, `_fromTimestamp`, and `_toTimestamp` which are provided by the caller of the function. Since the function is `external`, it can be called by any user of the smart contract, and the user has control over the values of the parameters that are passed to the function. Therefore, the variables `_rate`, `_fromTimestamp`, and `_toTimestamp` within the function `calculateLinearInterestExternal` are controlled by the user.
