The variable _Value is data-dependent on _To in this context.

In the approve function, the _Spender and _From variables are used to determine the allowance for the spender to withdraw from the sender's balance. However, this relationship is not directly reflected in Solidty code. Instead, it is calculated based on historical transfers of tokens. This means that the value of _Allowance is dependent on both the current state of the contract and the history of all token transfers.


  How does the code determine that?
 
  The code determines that _allowance depends on two factors: the historical token transfer history and changes to the state variables. Specifically, when a token is transferred, its allowances are updated based upon the transfer amount and sender address. When a transfer is approved, a mapping is updated to reflect the approved amount for a given sponsor and token owner. These mappings are then used in subsequent transfers to ensure that only approved amounts can be withdrawn. Additionally, any changes made to these mappings may affect the calculation of allowanced amounts, so they must be recomputed every time a state variable changes. In this way, allowancing is a function of both historical transfer data and current contract state.
