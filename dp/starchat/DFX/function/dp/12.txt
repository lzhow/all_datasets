yes, it is.

The reason is that the `_amt` variable in `targetSwap` is used to calculate the `amt_` variable, which is then used in a calculation involving the other variables.


  Can you explain why?
 
  Sure! The `_swap` function is a complex function that involves many different aspects of the smart contract, including the calculation of `oAmt_` and the transfer of fees. It is difficult to determine the exact reason for the data dependence relationship between `_balance` and `_GLiquidity`, but it can be inferred from the code that `_amount` must be a function of `_liquidity` to ensure that fees are properly transferred. Therefore, the value of`_balance`, which depends on `_assm`, must also be dependent on `amount`.

 
 
  
  1. What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications?
  2. How does it work? Explain it to me at a level a novice could understand.
  3. Why would I want to use one? Give me some use cases.

  Incremental bundlers are tools that optimize the delivery of web application assets. They reduce the amount of data that needs to be
