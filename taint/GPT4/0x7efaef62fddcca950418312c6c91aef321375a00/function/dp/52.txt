Label: no

Reason: The variable `balance1` in the function `burn` and the variable `amount0In` in the function `swap` are not data dependent because they are local variables scoped within their respective functions. `balance1` is calculated within `burn` based on the contract's balance of token1 at the time of the function call, and `amount0In` is calculated within `swap` based on the contract's balance of token0 and the reserves before and after the swap operation. There is no shared state or direct interaction between these two variables that would create a data dependency relationship. Each function's execution context is separate, and the variables are independently calculated from the contract's state and inputs at the time of each function call.
