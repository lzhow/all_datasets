  
No, the `_cached_chain_id` variable in this function is a constant and is therefore not user-controlled. It is set to the value of the `chainId` property of `block` and does not change during the execution of this contract. Therefore, this variable is considered "no" in terms of being controlled or not by a user in a security context.
