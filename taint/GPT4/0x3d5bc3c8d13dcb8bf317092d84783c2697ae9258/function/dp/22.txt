Label: no

Reason: The variable `srcTokensNew` in the function `transferTokens` is calculated based on the current balance of the source address (`accountTokens[src]`) and the amount of tokens to be transferred (`tokens`). It is not influenced by any operations or state changes that occur in the function `_addReservesInternal`. The variable `error` in `_addReservesInternal` is used to capture the result of the `accrueInterest` function and the `_addReservesFresh` function within its own scope. There is no direct interaction or shared state between `srcTokensNew` and `error` that would create a data dependency relationship between them. Each function operates independently, and the variables within each function are scoped to that function and do not affect each other.
