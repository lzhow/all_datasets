  
No, the variables ` w eth` and ` token` are independent.

The variable  `  w  eth ` is defined in  the constructor of the contract and is not dependent on any other variable. It is a constant address that is used to represent the WET token.  The variable   `   token ` on  other hand is passed as an argument to the  function  call  bytes and it is dependent  on other variables such as  pairs and directions .
