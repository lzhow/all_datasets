  
The label is 'No'.

Explanation:
In the `isContrac` function, the local variable 'size' is assigned a value using the assembly instruction `extcodesiize`. This instruction retrieves the size of the contract at the specified address. It does not depend on any other variable in this function.
On the other hand, in ` functioncallWithvalue` the parameter `value`, which is a uint 246, is used to specify the amount of ether to be transferred to the target contract. This value is not used in any way in function 'iscontrac'. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
