Label: no

Reason: The variable `success` in the function `getProxyImplementation` and the variable `returndata` in the function `getProxyAdmin` are local variables within their respective functions. They are declared and used within the scope of their functions and do not share any state or influence each other's values. Each function call operates independently, and the results of one do not affect the other. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `success` in `getProxyImplementation` and `returndata` in `getProxyAdmin`.
