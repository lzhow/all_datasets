Reason: The variable `feeOn` in the function `mint` is determined by the state of the `feeTo` address in the `IPancakeFactory` contract and whether the `kLast` variable is non-zero. It is not directly dependent on the `balance1` variable in the function `burn`. The `balance1` variable in `burn` is a local variable that represents the balance of `token1` at the time of the `burn` function execution and is used to calculate the amounts to be burned and transferred. The `feeOn` variable's value is computed independently of `balance1` and is used to determine if the protocol fee should be minted as liquidity tokens. The two variables are related to different operations and do not have a direct data dependency relationship.
