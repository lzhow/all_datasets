The variable `compSpeed` in the function `updateContributorRewards` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `compSpeed` is set by the admin in the function `_setContributorCompSpeed`. The condition `require(msg.sender == admin, "only admin can set comp speed")` ensures that only the admin can set the value of `compSpeed`. Therefore, it is not controlled by the user.
