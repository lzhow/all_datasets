Explanation: The variable `total_` in the function `viewLiquidity` is not controlled by the user. It is a local variable that is calculated based on the values returned by the `Assimilators.viewNumeraireBalance` function and the loop iteration. The value of `total_` is determined solely by the logic of the code and does not depend on any user input or control.
