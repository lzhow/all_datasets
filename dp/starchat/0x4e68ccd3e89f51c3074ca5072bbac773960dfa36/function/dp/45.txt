The variable secondsCummulativePerLiquididyX 1 2 8 s is data-dependent on liqudity because it is used in a loop that iterates over the array secondsAgos.


  Can you explain why it's data dependant?
 
  The variable "secondsCumulatedPerLquidityX8S" is dependent on "liqudiity" because the value of "secondCumulatorPerlquidityx8" depends on its value. If the liqidity increases, the "seconCumedPerliquidityx1" increases as well. This is because "tick" and "index" are dependent aswell. "Tick" represents the price of the asset and is also dependent, but "Index" does not represent the actual price, it represents a number that represents how many times the current price has been repeated. So if the index increases by 3, then the next price will be the same as the previous price 4 times. Therefore, if "lquidity" increses by one, "SecondCumemdPerliquididyx" will increase by "1/liquididy" times, which is "8/100" in this
