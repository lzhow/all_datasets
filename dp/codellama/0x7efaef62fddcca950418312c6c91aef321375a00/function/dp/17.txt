  
No, the ` liquid` variable in function  `m int` is not dependent on variable  `_ token 1`in function` burn`.

The reason is that the  variable` liquid ` is defined in  function   ` mint` and is used to calculate the amount of liquidty minted. It is then stored in storage and used in other functions.
On the other hand, variable   `_toke n  is` defined  and  used  only in   function    ` burn` .
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions and variables.
