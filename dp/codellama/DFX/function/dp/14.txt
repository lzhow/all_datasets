  
No, the variables ` oAm_t` and `_ length` are independent.

The variable o Am_ t is defined in function  target Sw ap and is not dependent on any variable in get Target Sw a p Data. On the other hand, variable _ length is a local variable defined within the get target swap data function and it is only used within that function. Therefore, it cannot be accessed or modified from outside the scope of that variable.
