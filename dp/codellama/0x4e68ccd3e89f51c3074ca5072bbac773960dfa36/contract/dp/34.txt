  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `TranserHelper` library, the  ` safe Transfer` function calls the` transfer` method of the ERC-223 token contract. This method returns a tuple of two values: a boolean indicating whether the transfer was successful, and a bytes array containing the return value of `transer`.
Since the success of a transfer depends on whether `to` has enough balance to receive the amount of tokens being transferred, ` success` is data-dependent on ` value`. Therefore, we label `sucess` as ' Yes'.
