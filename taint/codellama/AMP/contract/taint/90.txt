  
No, the `_ granulatity ` variable in this function does not appear to be controlled directly by a user input. It is set to a constant value of  `1` in line 22, and is therefore not a variable that can be modified by an external user or attacker.

The `_total Supply` variable is also not user-controlled, as it appears to represent the total supply of the token, which is determined by other factors such as the number of tokens minted and the granuality of each token.
