The variable `originAmount_` in the function `viewTargetSwap` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `originAmount_` is determined by the logic of the `viewTargetSwap` function, which calculates the target amount based on the provided origin amount and the current state of the contract. The user does not have direct control over the calculation or assignment of `originAmount_`.
