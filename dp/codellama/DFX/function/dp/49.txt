  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `_nGliq`, `_weighs`, and `_length` variables are passed as arguments to the `for` loop. Within the loop, `_alpha` is calculated as `curve. alpha`. The `_upperAlph` and `lowerAlp` are calculated based on `_ alpha` as well.
Then, in each iteration of the for loop: 1. `_ nI`dea`l`is calculated by multiplying `_`n`G`li`q and`_`we`igh`ts[`i`]. 2. If `_ `nBal`s[ `i `]` is greater than `_ _` n`I `de`a `l`, then `_ oH`alt is calcu`lat`ed by multi`pli `ing `_ `_O`GL` iq,` `_w`eigh `ts [ ` i `],`and `_u`pper`Al`pha. 3. Then, if `_  `o`B`als [` ` `I ]` < `_ ``o `H `alt`, the contract reverts. Similarly, 4. if` _ ` nB `als [` ` I `] `> `_``n ` H ` alt, then the con`tract rever` t. In the second function: The`for `loop is similar to that in` the` first` function. However, there are some differences in how` alpha `is cal`cu `lat `ed and how `_ upper`Alpha` or `_ lower` Alpha`are cal `cu. `
Therefore, we can conclude that `_ohalt ` is data-dependent on` o`gli q`in the f`irst`function.
