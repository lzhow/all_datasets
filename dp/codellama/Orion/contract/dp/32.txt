In the `_swap` function, the `input` variable is assigned the value of `path`[`i`] and the`output`variable is set to ` path` [ `i+1`]. The `pair` is then set equal to the result of calling the static method `OrinMultiPollLibrary` `getpairfor` with the arguments `curfactory`, ` input`, and `output`. The`amount` array is passed as an argument to this method.
  The `_ swap` method then calls the method`swap `on the pair object, passing the values of` amount  `0` and` amoun t1 `as arguments. These values are calculated using the variables ` amount ` and  amount`1`.
   The values for ` amou nt  t0 `and`amou  n t  l` are then calculated by calling methods on ` pair` using ` getreserves`and ` quoteuv2`. These methods use the array ` amounts` as input. Therefore, `amoun  tin`is data-dependent on` amounts`.
