The variable `errorMessage` in `sub_` is user controlled. It is used to specify the error message to be thrown in case the subtraction results in an under-flow. Since the `require` statement in Soliditiy is a conditional statement that throws an error if its condition is `false`, the value of `b` is checked to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a  `uint` (2^256 -  ~~~). If `a` and ` b` are user inputs, then it can result in under flow if ` a` - `  b ` is less than  zero. In this case, the program will revert with the specified error.
