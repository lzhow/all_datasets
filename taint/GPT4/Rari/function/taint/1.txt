Reason: The variable `hasRights` in the function `_toggleFuseAdminRights` is not directly controlled by the user. It is passed as an argument to the function, but the value of `hasRights` is determined by the caller of the function. Without further information about how the value of `hasRights` is obtained, it is not possible to determine if it is controlled by the user or not.
