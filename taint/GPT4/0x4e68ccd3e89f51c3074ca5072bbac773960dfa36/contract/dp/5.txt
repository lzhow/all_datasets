Yes

The variable `liquidity` in the function `observeSingle` is directly passed as an argument from the function `observe`. In the `observe` function, `liquidity` is used as an argument in the call to `observeSingle`, which means that the value of `liquidity` in `observeSingle` depends on the value passed to it by `observe`. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between the `liquidity` variable in `observeSingle` and the `liquidity` variable in `observe`.
