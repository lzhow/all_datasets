Label: no

Reason: The variable `_implementation` in the function `setPartitionStrategy` is used to set an interface implementation for a given partition strategy. It does not directly affect the state of the contract's balances or the transfer of tokens. On the other hand, the `transfer` function is concerned with transferring tokens from one address to another and updating the `_balances` mapping accordingly. There is no direct data dependency between the `_implementation` variable, which is related to partition strategy interface implementations, and the internal state changes that occur during a token transfer. The `transfer` function does not read from or write to the `_implementation` variable or any state that is modified by the `setPartitionStrategy` function.
