Label: no

Reason: The variable `nGLiq_` in the function `getOriginSwapData` and the variable `nBals_` in the function `viewTargetSwapData` are local to their respective functions. In Solidity, local variables are not accessible outside of their functions unless they are returned by the function and explicitly passed to another. Since `nGLiq_` is calculated within `getOriginSwapData` and `nBals_` is calculated within `viewTargetSwapData`, and there is no direct passing of these variables between the functions or any indication that the state of one influences the other, they do not have a data dependency relationship. Each function operates independently, and the state of one does not affect the state of the other.
