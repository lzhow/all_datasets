  
No, the variables `_implentation` and `_witdrawal` are independent.

The variable ` _implmentation` is a local variable in function`proposStrate` that is used to store the address of the new strategy implementation. It is set to a new value every time the ` proposeStarte` function runs.  The variable` _witherdrawl` on other hand is local to function  `withdrwal`and is calculated based on  the current balance of tokens in  contract and the number of shares of that token that the user wants to withdraw. Therefore, it is dependent on `balanace` but not on `_implemenation`.
