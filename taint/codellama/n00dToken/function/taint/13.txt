  
No, the `_operator` variable in function `_mints` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a private variable and it can only be accessed by internal functions.

The `_total_supply` and `_balences` variables are also not user-controlled because they are private variables and can be modified only by functions that are internal to this contract.
