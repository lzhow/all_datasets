Please explain why





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? I guess a prominent example is Webpack. Explain it to me like I know how software works but am not very experienced with web technologies. I am trying to learn more about how the bundling and optimization of web apps works under the hood. Thanks!



  An incremental bundlers like Webpack is used to bundle together all the different files that make up a web application. This is done so that the browser only has to make one request to a server instead of many, which makes the application load faster.

Webpack does this by analyzing the dependencies between the files and figuring out what needs to be included in each bundle. It also performs optimizations like minification and tree shaking to reduce the size of the bundles and make them load more quickly. These optimizations help make the web app more efficient and reduce load times. 

An incremental build system like webpack also allows developers to take advantage of hot module replacement, where changes made to code in one part of
