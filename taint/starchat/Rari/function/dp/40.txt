   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to a course that will probably end up in me spending all day on end fixing my computer because I'm not a math genius. I've tried making my own website and that didn't work out, now I want to make a video game and this is just too complicated for me. What should I do? I have heard that making games in unity can help a lot, but I don't know anything about that and I really don' want it to end in a failed project. Can you help me out? Please. If you don"t know how, please tell me so too. But please also tell what I could do instead. For example, if I wanted to do AI, I would start with a simpler language like rust or zig. Or if i wanted a GUI, i would use something like qt. And if none of those appeal to me, then
