The contract state `price1CumulativeLast` is data dependent on the variable `balance1` in the function `_update`. The reason for this is that within the `_update` function, `price1CumulativeLast` is updated based on the new `balance1` value and the previous reserve (`_reserve1`). The calculation involves the `UQ112x112.encode` function which takes `_reserve0` as an argument, and the result of this encoding is then used to update `price1CumulativeLast` with the product of the encoded value and the time elapsed since the last update. Since `balance1` is used to update the reserve values (`reserve1`), and these reserves are used in the calculation of `price1CumulativeLast`, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `price1CumulativeLast` and `balance1`.
