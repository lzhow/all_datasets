The variable `underlying` in the function `getUnderlyingPrice` is data dependent on the variable `cToken` because the value of `underlying` is derived from the `cToken` variable. Specifically, `underlying` is assigned the result of calling the `underlying()` function on a `CErc20` object that is cast from the `cToken` address. This means that the value of `underlying` directly depends on the value of `cToken`, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two variables.
