Explanation:
In the `Swap` function, the value of `amountOut` is calculated based on `reserves` and `liquidities`. The `getReserve` method is called to get the current reserves of the two tokens. Then, `require` statements are used to check if the output amount is sufficient and if there is enough liquidity.
After that, a new variable called `to`is created, which is used as the recipient of tokens in case of a successful swap.  The function then calculates the amount of input tokens required to cover the swap amount. This is done by subtracting the input amount from the balance of each token. If the result is negative, it means that the user does not have enough tokens to perform the transaction. In this case, an error is thrown. Finally, if all the conditions are met, tokens are transferred from `msg` to `recipient` using the `_safeTranfer` internal function.
