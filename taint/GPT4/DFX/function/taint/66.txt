No, the variable `totalSupply_` in the function `totalSupply` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The variable `totalSupply_` is a state variable of the `Curve` contract and its value is determined by the contract's internal logic. It represents the total supply of the Curve token and is updated by the contract's functions such as `proportionalDeposit` and `proportionalWithdraw`. The user does not have direct control over this variable.
