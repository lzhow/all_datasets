The variable `_p` in the function `updateFees` is not controlled by the user. 

Reason: The value of `_p` is derived from the division of `_price` by either `USD_PRICE_SELL` or `USD_PRICE_BUY`, which are constants defined within the contract. The user does not have any control over these constants, so the value of `_p` is not influenced by user input. Therefore, the variable `_p` is not controlled by the user.
