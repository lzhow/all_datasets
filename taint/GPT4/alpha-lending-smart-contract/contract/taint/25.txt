Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `_recipient` in the function `mintAlToken` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is marked as `external`, it can be called by any user or contract outside of this contract. The caller of the function specifies the value of `_recipient`, which means it is controlled by the user who initiates the transaction calling this function.
