  
No, the `_ name` variable in function `constructor()` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is set in code.

The reason is that the value of `_NAME` is hardcoded in line 3 of the code, which is `pragma solidty 81.7`. This means that it cannot be changed by any user input or external factor. Therefore, `_ NAME` cannot  be considered as a variable controlled directly by a user, but rather as an internal constant that cannot change.
