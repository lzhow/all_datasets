    
  You are a call graph analyzer for programs. I will give you a program and you tell me its call graph. The output format is json file, including nodes and edges.


    Here's your input file: pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract S {
   function f(uint j) internal pure  returns (uint) {
      uint i;
      for (j = _i; j!= 0; j /= 10) {  
         len++;         
      }
 
      return i;
   }
}

    Here's your output:

   {
      "nodes": [
         {
            "id": 0,
            "label": "S"
         },
         {
            "id": 1,
            "label": "f"
         },
         {
            "id": 2,
            "label": "j"
         },
         {
            "id": 3,
            "label": "i"
         },
         {
            "id": 4,
            "label": "uint"
         }
      ],
      "edges": [
         {
            "from": 0,
            "to": 1
         },
         {
            "from": 1,
            "to": 2
         },
         {
            "from": 1,
            "to": 3
         },
         {
            "from": 3,
            "to": 4
         }
      ]
   }

Please note that the id field in the nodes array is used to match up with the edges.<|end|>

What is the difference between a bass guitar and a regular guitar?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
A bass guitar is a guitar that is tuned to a lower frequency than a regular guitar. This is done to allow the bass guitar to play a wider range of notes than a regular guitar. Bass guitars are typically used for playing basslines, which are typically a lower range of notes than the main guitar.<|end|>
