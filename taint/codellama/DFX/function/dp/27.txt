  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `for` loop iterates over the array `reserve` and assigns the value of `viewNumerirebalance` to `nBal_`. The `if` statement checks if `i` is not equal to `_inputIX` before assigning the result of the subtraction of `_bal` from `amt`to `nbals`. If `I`is equalto `_ inputIX`, the`if statement` assignes the results of`intakeraWAndgetBalanceto` `am_t`and `_ bal`.
`oBAL_ [i]` is assigned the difference between `_Bal` an `AMT_`, and `NBALS_ _[I]`is assigned `_ Bal`. `OGL iq`_ is incremented by `OBAL _ [I]`,and `NGL IQ` _is increment by`NBals _ _`[ I]`.
 In the second function , the same process is repeated.
Therefore, ` oGLIQ_ ` is data-dependent on ` curve` because it is used in a loop that iterated over ` reserves` which is a member of curve, and the loop assign the values of  ` viewNumericBalances` of each reserve to` nBal _`.
