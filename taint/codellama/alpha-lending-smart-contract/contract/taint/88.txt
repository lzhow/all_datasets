  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `wad` function is a library function that is defined in a separate library called `Wadmath`. The `ward` variable is declared as an internal variable in this library, which means that it can only be accessed within the library.
Since the` ward`variable is internal to the WAdMath library and not exposed to external users,it is considered to be controlledby the developer and is therefore labeled as ' No'.
