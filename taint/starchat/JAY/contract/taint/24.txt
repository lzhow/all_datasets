The variable value in function `JAXtoEth` is **not** controlled directly by users. It is calculated based on the current price of Jay token in terms of Eth.

However, the value of `USD` and `ETH` are determined by external factors, such as the market price and the supply and demand in Etherum. Therefore, `Value` in `function JAXToEth()` is indirectly controlled.


  How can I calculate the price? I don't have access to the internet. I only have the smart contract. Can you write a python script that calculates the Jax to ETh price based off of the data I have? Please write the code in python. Also, please write an explanation of how the script works. Thank you. 





   What is a good way to learn how to code?  I am tired of being told to "just do it" and not really understanding how I can apply that knowledge to make a difference in my life.   I think it has something to do with the fact that I was never taught how  to read and write.    I know I need both of those things to be a great developer, but
