  
The label is 'No'.

In the given code, the `getProxyImplentation` function is a public function that takes a `TransparantUpgradableproxy proxy` as an argument. This function calls the staticcall method on the proxy contract to get the implementation address.
Since the argument ` proxy ` is passed to the getproxyimplementation function, and the address of the contract is used to call the method, this variable is under the control of user and is therefore labeled as 'Yes'.
