Reason: The variable `reserveInput` in the function `_swap` is used to store the reserve amount of a token from a liquidity pair in a Uniswap-like exchange. It is calculated locally within the `_swap` function using the `getReserves` method of a pair contract, and its value is based on the current state of the reserves in the liquidity pool at the time of the swap.

On the other hand, the variable `amounts` in the function `_swapCurve` is an array used to store amounts related to token swaps in a Curve-like exchange. It is used to handle the logic of swapping tokens within Curve pools and is independent of the Uniswap-like exchange logic.

Since `reserveInput` is derived from the state of a Uniswap-like pair contract and `amounts` is used within the context of a Curve-like swap, there is no direct data dependency between `reserveInput` and `amounts`. They are used in separate parts of the contract for different types of swaps and do not rely on each other's values.
