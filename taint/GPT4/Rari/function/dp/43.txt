The variable `mathErr` in the function `borrowBalanceStoredInternal` is not data dependent on the variable `allowed` in the function `mintFresh`. 

Reason: The variable `mathErr` in the function `borrowBalanceStoredInternal` is only assigned values within the function itself and does not depend on any external variables or states. Similarly, the variable `allowed` in the function `mintFresh` is also assigned a value within the function and does not depend on any external variables or states. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
