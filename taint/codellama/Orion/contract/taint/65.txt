  
The variable userAmoutIn in doSwaTthroughOrinPool function of the contract is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the value of user AmountIn is calculated based on the amount of tokens that are transferred to the smart contract. This value is determined by user input and is therefore controlled  by them.

In the code, the `doSawpTrohughOrinoPool` function takes in a `SwappData` struct as an argument, which contains the information about the swap. One of these fields is `amountSpend`, which is used to calculate the input amount for the token swap operation.  The `getAmounIn()` function, called in this function to get the actual amount in, takes the path of token pairs and the desired amount as input. It then calculates the minimum amount that needs to be transferred based  on this information. Finally, this amount is passed to `safeautoTranserFrom()` to transfer the tokens to this contract, and this is where the control of `UserAmountin` is transferred. Therefore, ` UserAmountIN` in `DoSwaptrothroughOrionoPool()` is indeed controlledby the User.
