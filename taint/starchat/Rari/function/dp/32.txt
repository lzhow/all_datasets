   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't really know where to start. I've used other languages before, like C++, but this is my first time trying to program. Can you recommend a few good resources for me to use to get started with python, along with some simple programs that I can write as a way of testing my knowledge? I'd also appreciate it if you could recommend some good textbooks or other resources that have helped people learn tocode in general. Thank you!
