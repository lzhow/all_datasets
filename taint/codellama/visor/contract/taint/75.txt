In the given code, the `findUpperbound` function is a library function that takes an array of uint  and an element as input. It returns the index of the element in array if it exists, otherwise it returns  the number of elements in  array that are less than the input element.
  The variable  is an internal variable of  function and it's not exposed to the outside world. Therefore,  variable is NOT controlled  by user and the answer is No.
