Reason: The variable `protocolFeeDefault_` is not directly present in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context and naming convention, it seems to refer to a default protocol fee setting, which would typically be defined within the `ProtocolFee` contract or a similar contract that manages fees for the protocol.

Such a variable would likely be set by the contract owner or through a governance mechanism, rather than being directly controlled by a standard user. The `Ownable` contract imported from OpenZeppelin suggests that there is an ownership model in place, which usually means that only the owner has the authority to set or change important parameters like default fees.

Since the code for the `ProtocolFee` contract or the actual declaration of `protocolFeeDefault_` is not provided, we cannot definitively say how it is controlled, but based on standard practices and the context provided, it is reasonable to assume that it is not user-controlled.
