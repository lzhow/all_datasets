  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `sender` variable is assigned the value of `interfaceAddrs(_toPartion,AMP_TKNS_SR)`. The `to` parameter is also passed to the same function. Therefore, `senders` is data-dependent on ` _ to`.
Similarly, in function 2, variable  ` from Partitions` are assigned values of  `_get Partiton Prefix(_ from partition)`.  The `_to ` parameter in both functions is passed.  Therefore `From Partions` and `_ to` have data dependencies.
