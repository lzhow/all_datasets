Reason: The variable `liquidityNet` is data dependent on the variable `amountSpecified` due to the control flow and calculations that involve `amountSpecified` which eventually influence the value of `liquidityNet`.

Here's the explanation of the data dependency:

1. The `amountSpecified` variable is used to determine the `exactInput` boolean variable, which is a key part of the control flow in the swap function.

2. The `exactInput` variable influences the `state.amountSpecifiedRemaining` within the while loop, which is used in the `computeSwapStep` function to calculate `step.amountIn` and `step.amountOut`.

3. The `state.amountSpecifiedRemaining` is then updated based on the `exactInput` condition, which affects the calculations of `state.amountCalculated`.

4. The `state.amountSpecifiedRemaining` and `state.amountCalculated` are used in the loop's condition and calculations, which means they are part of the logic that determines when the loop ends.

5. Within the same loop, if `state.sqrtPriceX96` equals `step.sqrtPriceNextX96` and `step.initialized` is true, the `liquidityNet` variable is calculated by calling the `ticks.cross` function.

6. The `liquidityNet` calculation indirectly depends on the `state.feeGrowthGlobalX128` which is updated in the loop based on the `exactInput` condition and the `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` or `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` values, which are also influenced by the `zeroForOne` condition that is related to the `amountSpecified`.

7. The `liquidityNet` value is then used to update `state.liquidity`, which is also dependent on the loop's execution that is controlled by `amountSpecified`.

Given this chain of dependencies, we can conclude that `liquidityNet` is indeed data dependent on `amountSpecified`. Changes to `amountSpecified` would affect the control flow and calculations within the swap function, ultimately influencing the value of `liquidityNet`.
