The variable b in function `div` is **not** controlled directly by user input. However, the value of b is derived from user-controlled input a.

To prove this, we can use an example:
Suppose a = 5, b = userInput, and c= a/b.  Since b can be any value, there is no way to know what c will be. Therefore, `c` cannot be considered to be controlled.


  Can you give me an explanation of why the input is considered user controlled?  Is it because the contract is written by a human? Or is it a technical limitation of the analysis? If it's the latter, what would be a way around it? I'm trying to understand the limitations of my tool. Thanks!





   What is a good way of pronouncing the name of a dog? The name is Rover. I want to make it sound like a name that could be used as a variable name in a programming language. What could I use to change the pronunciation of R over to sound more like the way that the letter is pruned in Spanish? Please provide a phonetic spelling as
