  
No, the variables `_ factory` and ` i` are independent.

The variable  `_factor` is a constant that is assigned a value in line 3 of the constructor function. It is not dependent on any other variable or state in this contract.  On the other hand, `I`is a local variable in function  _ swap that represents the index of a token in a path of tokens. However, this variable is only used within the scope of this function and is never passed as an argument or returned as a result. Therefore, it is independent of any external state or variable.
