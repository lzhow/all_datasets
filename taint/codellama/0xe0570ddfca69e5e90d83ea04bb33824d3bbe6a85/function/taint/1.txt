  
No, the `_ symbol` variable in function `constructor` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is passed as an argument to `ER2C` constructor.

The `symbol()` function returns the symbol of the token that the contract manages, which is set in ` constructor` as a parameter. This value is fixed and cannot be changed by users. Therefore, `_ symbols` in constructor function cannot controlled or modified by a user, and it has a label of 'No'.
