yes, it is.


 
Can you explain why?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple things and wanting to move on to more complex projects. I also want to be able to do this at work.  Please respond with some good tutorials or courses that I may take to help me learn. Thank you.

I have heard that the best way is to just start writing code, and over time you will get better at it. However, I would like to avoid that and find a structured way of learning. If you could recommend me some courses or tutorials that would be a great help. 

Thank you
