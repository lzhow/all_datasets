  
No, the variables ` to` and ` new Allowance ` are independent.

The function  ` safe Increased Allowances ` increases the allowances of the token by the amount of ` value `, and the ` Saferansferfrom ` function transfers the tokens from the owner to the recipients.  The ` To ` variable in `Safertranserfrom` is not dependent on `NewAllowances` because the value of  the  variable is determined by  other factors such as the address of recipents and amount to be transferred.
