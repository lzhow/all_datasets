Label: No

Reason: The variable `last` in the function `write` is assigned the value of an element from the `self` array at a specific index. The `self` array represents the storage of observations, and while the contents of the array can be influenced by user actions through public or external functions that may call `write`, the direct assignment of `last` within the `write` function is not directly controlled by the user. It is determined by the contract's logic and the current state of the contract's storage. The user does not have direct control over the specific assignment to `last` within the function's execution.
