Label: no

Reason: The variable `_spender` in the function `allowanceByPartition` is used to access the mapping `_allowedByPartition` to retrieve the allowance amount for a particular owner-spender pair within a specific partition. On the other hand, the variable `partitionManagerImplementation` in the function `_callPostTransferHooks` is a local variable that is assigned the address of a contract implementation based on the partition strategy. There is no direct assignment or computational relationship between `_spender` and `partitionManagerImplementation`, nor do they share state that would create a data dependency. The two variables operate in different contexts and for different purposes within the contract, and changes to one do not affect the other.
