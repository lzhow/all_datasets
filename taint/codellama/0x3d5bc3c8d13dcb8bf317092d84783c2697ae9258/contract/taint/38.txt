  
No, the `` variable in function ``_acceptadmin`` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable and it can only be accessed within the scope of the `_acceptAdmint` function.

The `msg` variable is a global variable that contains information about the current message, such as the sender and the data. It is set by Solidiy automatically and can be used by any function in a contract. However, in this case, ` msg` is used to check if `pendingadmin` and `admin ` are equal to the `sender` address, which is also a user-controlled variable. Therefore, this variable can also be controlled or manipulated by a malicious user, and its value can change during the execution of this function, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
