    Here's your input file: pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract S {
   function A(uint j) internal pure returns (uint) {
      while (j!= 0) {
         j += 10;
      }
        return j;
   }
}

    Here's your output:

   {
      "nodes": [
         {
            "id": 0,
            "label": "S"
         },
         {
            "id": 1,
            "label": "A(uint256)"
         }
      ],
      "edges": [
         {
            "from": 0,
            "to": 1
         }
      ]
   }

Please note that the id field is just an auto-generated incremental index, you can ignore it.<|end|>

What is the difference between a bass guitar and a regular guitar?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
A bass guitar is a guitar that is tuned to a lower frequency than a regular guitar. This is done to allow the bass guitar to play a wider range of notes than a regular guitar. Bass guitars are also typically made of a different material than regular guitars, such as steel or nickel, which helps to reduce the weight and improve the sound of the instrument.<|end|>
