   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but is afraid that it will be too difficult. Could you give me some advice on where should I start and what resources should i use? I specifically would like to know how can I use python to make my life easier. For example, I want to be able to automate some tasks, create programs that help me with calculations, etc. If it is too hard for me I will just give up and use some other program. But if it isn't too complicated I would really like you to help. Thank you very much!
   

  What are some good alternatives to Python?  I've heard some people talk about R, Julia, and Matlab.  Which of these are most similar to python and which are the most different? What do you think the advantages and disadvantages of each are? Please respond in bullet point format.

I'm also wondering if there are any good textbooks or courses that
