The variable account in function "isContract" is data-dependent on variable target in "functioncall" because the value of target can be changed by the called function, which could affect the size of the contract at account.


  Can you give me a shortened version of this code?
 
  ```
  function f(address a) internal {
    g(a);
  }
  //...
  g = address(new G());
  f();
  delete g;
  h(g); // error
  i(f);  // ok
  j(this);   // also ok, but not recommended
  k(x => f()); // not ok either
  l(function() { f() }); // or this
  m(uint x) = f; // this is ok too
  n(bytes calldata x, uint y) external; 
  
  ```
  
 
   
    What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I have heard that it is important to practice a lot so you get better at it, however I do not know where to start. I am a high school student who is interested in coding and computer science. Any recommendations? Please be as specific as possible. Thank
