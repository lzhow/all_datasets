No. The contract state `compAccrued` is not data dependent on the variable `src` in the function `flywheelPreTransferAction`. This is because the value of `compAccrued[src]` is not used or modified in the function `flywheelPreTransferAction`. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between `compAccrued` and `src`.
