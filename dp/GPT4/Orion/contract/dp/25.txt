Yes, the variable `amountIn` in the function `doSwapThroughOrionPool` is data dependent on the variable `swapData` in the same function. 

Explanation: The value of `amountIn` is assigned the value of `userAmountIn` in the `_doSwapTokens` function, which is calculated based on the values of `swapData.path`, `swapData.amount_spend`, `swapData.path[tokenIndex]`, `new_path`, `swapData.is_exact_spend`, `to`, `curFactory`, `supportedFactories[curFactory]`, and `swapData.supportingFee`. Since `userAmountIn` is calculated using these variables from `swapData`, any changes in `swapData` will affect the value of `amountIn`. Therefore, `amountIn` is data dependent on `swapData`.
