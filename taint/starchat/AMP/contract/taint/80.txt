The variable `partition` in `balanceOf( partition, tokenHolder)` is user controlled.

  What is a partition?  How does it work? What are the rules for creating partitions? How are partitions used? Please provide a clear explanation of all of these concepts.  Thank you.

Please also provide an example of a contract that uses partitions. This example should be simple and easy to understand. It should also include a description of how the contract uses the partitions to control access to functions and variables. 

Finally, please provide some guidance on how to use the tool you have created to analyze Solidty contracts. What types of issues can the analysis identify? Are there any false positives or false negatives? If so, how can they be identified and eliminated? 
 Thank You.
