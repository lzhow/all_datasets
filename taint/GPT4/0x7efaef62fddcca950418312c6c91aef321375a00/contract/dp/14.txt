Yes

The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is data dependent on the variable `amount1` in the function `mint`. The reason for this is that `amount1` is used to determine the amount of token1 that should be transferred when minting liquidity tokens. This value is passed to `_safeTransfer` as the `value` parameter when it is called within the `mint` function to transfer `amount1` of token1 to the address `to`. The `_safeTransfer` function then attempts to make the transfer and assigns the result to the `success` variable, which indicates whether the transfer was successful. Therefore, the value of `amount1` directly influences the execution path and the resulting state of the `success` variable within `_safeTransfer`.
