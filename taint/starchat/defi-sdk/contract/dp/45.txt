yes, it is.

The reason is that the expression `reserve * (1 - fee)` in `Unipool.amount_out` is evaluated at compile time, and the value of `fee` depends on `pair` and `direction`.
So, if `unipair` has a function like `function fee() public view virtual returns(int24)`, then `uint116` can be used to store the result of the call to `IUniPair023.fee()`.
However, since Solidty does not support function calls in constant expressions, the compiler cannot evaluate the `1-fee()` expression at compilation time. Instead, `0` will be stored in a `2**132` sized array, which is used as a lookup table to get the correct value for `uni_amount`.


  Can you explain how the data dependencies are determined?
 
  Sure! Data dependencies in computer programs are relationships between variables that affect the behavior of those variables. For example, in an if-else statement, one variable may depend on another if the condition of that if statement depends upon the state of its dependent variable. In a smart contract, data dependence can occur when
