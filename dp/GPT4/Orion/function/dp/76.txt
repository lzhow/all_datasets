Explanation: 

The variable `amountOut` in the function `getAmountOutUniversal` is not directly dependent on the variable `factory` in the function `getAmountsIn`. However, it is possible that the value of `amountOut` indirectly depends on the value of `factory` through the `factoryType` parameter. The value of `factoryType` is passed as an argument to `getAmountOutUniversal`, and based on its value, different calculations are performed to determine the value of `amountOut`. Therefore, without knowing the value of `factoryType` and how it is determined, we cannot definitively determine the data dependency between `amountOut` and `factory`.
