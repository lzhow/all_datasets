  
The variable `seizeAmount` in function ` sezeAllow` is labeled as ' yes'. The reason is that the `cToken` parameter is passed as an argument to the contract, which means that it can be controlled or manipulated by a user who calls the method.

In this case, the value of ` ctoken` can change depending on the input of the caller, and it may not be a fixed value. Therefore, `ctoken` cannot be considered as a constant value and is considered to be under the control of a variable.
