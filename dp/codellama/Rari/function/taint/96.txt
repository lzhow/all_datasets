In the given code, the `sub` function is defined as follows:
`function sub ( uint 2 5 6  a , uint  2  5  6   b ) internal  pure  returns  (  uint   2   5   6    c  ) {  return   sub  ;  } `
This function takes two arguments ` a ` and ` b ` of type ` uint `, and returns a value of the same type.
However, there is no information about the source of these arguments. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the value `  c ` is user-controlled or not.
