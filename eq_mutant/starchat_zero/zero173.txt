In C, sematical equivalence means that the meaning of the code is preserved when the source code undergoes slight modifications. The C compiler will generate the original binary file. 

The two given code fragments are syntactically different, therefore they cannot be semanticaly equivalent in this case. However, they might be equal according to some static equivalency rules. It is not clear in general what the expected semantics of this code are, and how it should be evaluated by a static analyzer.
