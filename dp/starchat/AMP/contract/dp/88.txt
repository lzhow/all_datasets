The variable `partition` in `transfer` is not used in this function, so it is irrelevant for the data dependence analysis.

However, the `from` parameter in both functions is used to check if the `_operator` address is authorized to transfer the tokens. If the transfer is approved, then the value of the allowances for `_from`, `_spnder`, and `_token` must be updated. Therefore, it can be inferred that the variables `allowed` and `operator`, which are used by the approve function to update the values of allowable tokens, are dependent on `to`.
