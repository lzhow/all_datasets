In the `snapshotCulmulatives` function, the variables `secondsCummulative` and `secondPerLiqidtyCmmulativex100` are calculated based on `ticks` which are passed as arguments to the functions.
`tics` is an array of structs, where each struct has a field called `initialised` that is set to true when the struct is initialised.  The `checkTick` method checks that the tics are initialise before using them.   The function also uses the fields `observations` to calculate the cumulative values. `Observations.Observe` returns a tuple of three values, which the first value is assigned to `TicCmumlative` the second value to  `SecondsPerliqditycummulativex208`and the third value assigned  to`secondsoutside`.
  In the mint function the value of `amount`is passed to `_modifyposition` as a parameter. `_Modifyposition` uses `liquididy`to calculate `LicquidtiyDelta`which is then used to update the values of`tickcummumalte`in the`snapshotsCullmulates`function. Therefore, ` tickcmmulativeupper` depends on`amount`.
