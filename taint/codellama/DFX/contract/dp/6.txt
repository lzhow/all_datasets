  
No, the variables `new_shells_ ` and ` curves _` are independent.

The variable  ` new_ shells _ ` is calculated based on  `_ deposit _`, which is a function parameter, and  `__o_GL_i_q_`,  which  is obtained from the  function  get_gros_liquid_and_bal_for_depo_it .
On the other hand,  the ` cur_ves _  variable is returned by the view_propor_dep_ function, which does not depend on any variables in  proportional_ depos_ . Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
