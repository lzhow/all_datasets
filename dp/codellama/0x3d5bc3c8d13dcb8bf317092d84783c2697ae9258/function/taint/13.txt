In the given code, the `transferVerity` function is defined as follows:
`function transferVery(uint transferAmount)`
This function takes in a `uint` parameter called `tranferAmount`.
Since the parameter is passed in as a function argument, and not as part of the contract's state, we can conclude that the value of `trasnferAmout` is under the control of a user, as it can be modified by a malicious actor.
Therefore, in this case, ` src` in `function tranferVey(src, dst)` is also controlled under user control.
