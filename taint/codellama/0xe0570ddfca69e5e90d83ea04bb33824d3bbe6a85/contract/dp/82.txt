  
No, the `_deciamls` contract variable is data-independent of the ` _ after` variable in function` deposite`.

The `_ decamals ` variable stores the number of decmial places for the token being deposited, which is a constant value that is set in constructor. It is independent of any other variable or state in contract.
On the other hand, `_ after ` is calculated based on `balanace()` function, and it is dependent on other variables and states in contrat, such as `_pool` and `total supply`. Therefore, it cannot be considered as data independent.
