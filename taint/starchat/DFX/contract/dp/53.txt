The variables in both functions are state variables of the contract. They are used to store information about the state of a contract, and so they have data dependencies on each other.

In the `isDataDependentOn` function, the first parameter (`variable`) is a state variable of type `address`, and the second parameter is `state`. `State` is an object that contains all the information that is necessary to analyze a Solidty contract and determine if it has any data-dependent variables. In this case, `variable` and `self.state_variables[state]` are both state-variables of `Address` contract that have to be checked for data dependence. Since they both have the same type (`address`), and they refer to the exact same state, it can be concluded that they do not have any direct data or control dependences on one another. Therefore, we can return `False` in this function.


  Can you explain what data and control dependencies are?
 
  Data and Control dependencies refer specifically to how changes in one variable or state can affect other variables and states. Data dependencies occur when one or more variables are directly dependent on another variable. Control dependents are when a change in a variable
