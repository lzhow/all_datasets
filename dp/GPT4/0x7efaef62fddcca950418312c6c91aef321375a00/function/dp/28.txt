The variable `success` in the function `_safeTransfer` is data dependent on the variable `token` because `success` is the result of the low-level `call` to the address contained in `token`. The `call` function is used to execute a function call to another contract or address, and in this case, it is being used to attempt a token transfer. The `success` variable captures the success status of this call, which directly depends on the `token` address provided as the target of the call. If the address in `token` changes, it could lead to a different outcome for the `call`, and thus a different value for `success`.
