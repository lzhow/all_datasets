Reason: In Solidity, function parameters are scoped to the function itself, meaning that the parameters `a` and `b` in the `mod` function are completely separate from the parameters `a` and `b` in the `sub` function. There is no data dependency between the two `b` variables because they are local to their respective functions and do not share state or influence each other's values. Each function call operates with its own independent set of inputs.
