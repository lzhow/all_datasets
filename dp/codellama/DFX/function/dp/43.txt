  
The label is 'Unknown'.

In the `function` ` intakRawandGetbalance`, the variables ` am t_ ` and ` bal_  ` are returned by the internal function call ` ab i. decode (delegate (_assem,data),(int 1 2 8 ,int  1  2  8 ))`. The `data` variable is created by encoding the arguments of the external function using the ABI.
However, the argument `_ quoteWeight_ _` is not included in this encoding. Therefore, it is unclear whether the value of ` _ quoteweight_ `_` affects the calculation of` am_ t _`.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether `am_t _ ` is data-dependent on `  _  quote weight _ _ `.
