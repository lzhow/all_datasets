Reason: The contract state `name` is a constant string defined in the `PancakeERC20` contract with the value 'Pancake LPs'. It is not a variable, but a constant state that is set at the time of contract deployment and cannot be changed afterwards. The variable `_token1` in the function `swap` of the `PancakePair` contract is a local copy of the state variable `token1`, which represents the address of the second token in the pair. The `swap` function uses `_token1` to perform token transfers and balance updates, but it does not interact with the `name` state in any way. Therefore, there is no data dependency relationship between the `name` state and the `_token1` variable within the `swap` function or anywhere else in the contract.
