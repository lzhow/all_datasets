Label: No

Reason: The variable `owner` in the contract `RewardsHypervisor` is initially set to the address of the creator of the contract in the constructor (`owner = msg.sender;`). After that, the only way it can be changed is through the `transferOwnership` function, which is guarded by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that only the current owner can change the `owner` variable. Since the ability to change this variable is not open to any user but is restricted to the current owner, it is not controlled by users at large, but by a specific privileged user (the current owner). Therefore, the variable `owner` is not generally controlled by the user.
