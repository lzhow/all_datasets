Yes

The variable `success` in the function `getProxyImplementation` is data dependent on the variable `proxy`. This is because `success` is the result of a `staticcall` to the `proxy` address, which is used to determine if the call to retrieve the implementation address was successful. The `staticcall` is directly using the `proxy` variable as the target address for the call, and thus the value of `success` depends on the address held by `proxy`.
