  How do I know if a variable is "user controlled"?
  
  You can check if it's user-controlled by looking at the contract's source code. If the source is available, you can search for the keyword "public" or "private" to determine if that variable can be modified by external contracts. However, if you don't have access to the original source, then you may need a more advanced tool to analyze your contract for you. Some tools can automatically analyze Solidty code to check for user control, such as Mythril or Slither. These tools will look for vulnerabilities and other issues in your code, and provide you with a report that can help you identify user controls.

If you're using a tool like Remix, which allows you to write and test Solidit code in a web browser, these tools may not always be able to detect user controllability. In that case, I would recommend looking for documentation or tutorials on how to use the tool you are using to ensure that you understand how it works and how user inputs are handled. Additionally, some tools like MythX may provide additional information on
