  What are the main differences between Built in Render Pipeline (Default), Universal Render pipeline (URP) and High definition Renderpipeline (HDRP)?
  
The Built-in Render Pipline (default), also known as the Classic RenderPipeline, is Unity's original rendering system. It is still used in many projects, but it is no longer being actively developed.

Unity's Universal render pipeline, or URP, was introduced in Unity 2.0 and is designed to be more efficient and flexible than the Built In RenderPipline. UPR is optimized for mobile and VR devices, and it includes features such as post-processing, lighting, shaders, shadows, reflection probes, dynamic batching and more. 

High Definition Render Pipelines, also called HDRP, were introduced with Unity version 5.6. They are designed for modern, high-end graphics hardware and are
