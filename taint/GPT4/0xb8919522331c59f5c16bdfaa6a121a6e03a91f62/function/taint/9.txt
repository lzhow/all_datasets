In the `upgrateAndCal` function, the parameter `dat` is passed as an argument to the internal function `proxy. upgradeToandCall`. The `value` parameter is also passed to this function.
Since the data parameter can be controlled directly by a user, and the value parameter may be set by an external contract, this variable is considered controlledby theuser.
