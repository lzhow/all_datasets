The variable is defined as a local variable in a function, and it's not passed as an argument to the contract constructor or any other function. Therefore, the value of the ` reserveFacotrPlusFeeMaxmantiss` variable cannot be controlled directly by a user, as it can only be modified within the scope of that function and cannot affect the state of other parts of contract.
