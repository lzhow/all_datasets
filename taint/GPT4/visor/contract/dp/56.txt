Label: no

Reason: The variable `b` in the function `tryMod` and the variable `b` in the function `mod` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. Each function has its own separate execution context, and the parameters are passed by value, not by reference. This means that changes to `b` in one function do not affect the value of `b` in the other function. Since there is no shared state or direct interaction between these two instances of `b`, they are not data dependent.
