Explanation:
In the `MasterPrice` contract, the method `price` is overridden from the base class `BasePrice`. The `base` class has a method called ` price` that takes an `address` as an argument. In the overriding method, we can see that the argument is passed to the parent method.
Therefore, in this case, `Underlyin`g is data-dependent on `CTok`en.
