  
No, the variables `tick` and `seconds` are independent in both functions.

In the `snapshotCulumatives` function, `lower` is a local variable that is initialized based on `ticks` array, which is not dependent on any other variable. Similarly, in `Swaps` functions, variables such as `sqrtRationX`9`6`, `liqudity`, and`observations`are also local variables that are initialized independently. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions and the answer is 'No'.
