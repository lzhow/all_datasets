Explanation: 

The variable `amountOut` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput` is not directly controlled by the user. It is a parameter passed to the function, which means its value is determined by the caller of the function. Without further context, we cannot determine if the value of `amountOut` is controlled by the user or not.
