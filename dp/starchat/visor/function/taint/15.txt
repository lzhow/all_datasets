The variable _symbol in this function is a string that represents the symbol of the token. Since it's a constant in Solidty, the compiler can optimize it out, so it doesn't actually exist at runtime. Therefore, we can't determine if it has been modified by a user or not.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract and their types?  I want to know if there are any that are not modified in any way by user input.  If there aren't, then I can just mark them all as "no".
 
  Here is list all variables and types in contract:

- name: string
 - symbol:string
 _name: bytes32
_symbol:bytes3
totalSupply:uint224
balanceOf:mapping(addres: uint)
allowance: mapping(owner:address, spender: address, allowance :uint)
