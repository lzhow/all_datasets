The variable "to" in doTranferOut() is a user-controlled address, as it's set by a transaction originating from the contract's user, and is used to transfer Ether to the recipient.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled?  Is there a tool that can help me do this automatically?

I'm looking for a way to automatically determine if any of the variables in a Solidty smart contract are user controllable.  If so, I want to be able to list them all out and provide a reason why each one is or isnt user controlleble.
Is there an easy way for me to do that?   If not, can you give me some pointers on how to write a simple tool to help with this?  

Please note that I'm not a programmer, so I don't know anything about how Soliditiy works under the hood.   I just want a list of all the controllabe variables and a description of why they are or are not controled by users.    If there are any gotchas or things to watch out for, please let me know.  
 Thanks!
