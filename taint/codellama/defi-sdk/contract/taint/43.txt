In the `Ownership` contract, the owner of the contract is stored in a variable called `owner_`. The `setPendinOwner` function allows the current owner to set a new pending  owner. This function is marked with the modifer `onlyOwner`, which means that only the  current  `Owner ` can call this function.
Therefore, `PedingOwner `_ is a state variable that is only controlled  by  the OWner of  contract.
