Label: no

Reason: The variable `_amount` in the function `calculateRoundUpLiquidityShareAmount` is an input parameter to that function and its value is determined by the caller of the function. It is used to calculate the return value within the scope of that function only. On the other hand, the variable `liquidationBonus` in the function `calculateCollateralAmount` is a local variable within that function, obtained from the `pools` mapping and the `poolConfig` object associated with the `_token` address. There is no direct interaction or data flow between `_amount` and `liquidationBonus` as they are used in separate functions and their values are not dependent on each other based on the given code snippet. Each function operates independently, and the state of one variable does not influence the other.
