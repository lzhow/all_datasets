The variable `to` in the function `safeTransferFrom` is a parameter that specifies the recipient of the token transfer. It is used within the function to perform the transfer operation by encoding it into the data that is passed to the `_callOptionalReturn` function along with the `transferFrom` selector and the `value`.

The variable `newAllowance` in the function `safeIncreaseAllowance` is a local variable that calculates the new allowance by adding the `value` to the current allowance obtained from the `token.allowance` function. It is used to update the allowance by encoding it into the data that is passed to the `_callOptionalReturn` function along with the `approve` selector.

There is no direct data dependency between `to` and `newAllowance` because they are used in different contexts for different purposes and do not influence each other's values. `to` is related to the transfer of tokens, while `newAllowance` is related to the approval of a new allowance amount. They operate independently within their respective functions and do not share any state or influence each other's computation.
