The two programs are **semantically** not equal because they produce different outputs. Here is an example to illustrate this:
Input: `4 8 3 6 5 9 7 4`
Output for the first program: `[3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`

Now for mutated program, input becomes: `-4 -8 -3 -6 -5 -9 -7 -4`, and output is: 
`[-7,-9,-8,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2]` which is different than the output for first unmutated code.
This shows that the outputs of both programs when fed with same inputs are different, and hence semantic equality cannot be guaranteed.
