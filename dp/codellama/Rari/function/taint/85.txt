  
The variable 'ab' in function 'mulExp' is a local variable and is created by calling the 'getExp()' function. Therefore, the value of 'a' cannot be controlled directly by a user, and the answer is 'No'.

In the context of the smart contract, 'exp' refers to an exponential value, which is calculated using the mantissa and scale. In this case, both 'm' (m mantiss) and n (n mantis) are controlled indirectly by users through the input parameters of function calls. However, since the values of these variables are not directly accessible to the users, they cannot control the variables directly.
