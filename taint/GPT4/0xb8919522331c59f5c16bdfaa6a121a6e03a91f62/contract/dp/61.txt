Label: no

Reason: The variable `data` in the function `functionCallWithValue` and the variable `data` in the function `functionStaticCall` are function parameters that are scoped to their respective functions. They are not dependent on each other because each function's `data` parameter is a separate instance that is passed in when the function is called. Changes to one `data` parameter within one function do not affect the other `data` parameter in the other function. Each function has its own execution context and stack frame, and the parameters are not shared between these contexts.
