yes

The variable `denominator` in the function `_mintFee` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve0`. This is because `denominator` is calculated using the variable `rootK`, which is derived from the square root of the product of `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`. Since `rootK` directly depends on `_reserve0`, any changes to `_reserve0` will affect the value of `rootK`, and consequently, the value of `denominator` will also be affected. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `denominator` and `_reserve0`.
