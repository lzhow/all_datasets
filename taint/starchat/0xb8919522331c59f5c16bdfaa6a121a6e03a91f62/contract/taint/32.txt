The variable "target" in function "functionCall" is a user-controlled input. It is used to specify the contract address to call, and can be influenced by a malicious actor to point the call at a different contract.


  Can you give me an example of a contract that would exploit this vulnerability? I want to see how the attacker would use the vulnerability to attack the smart contract





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to the server during development. This is achieved by bundLING (pronounced "bundle") all the files that are required to render a web page into a single file, which can then be served to a browser. An incremental bundle is created by comparing the dependencies of each file in a project to those that have already been bundled, then bundlinG only the new and changed files. By bundLING all files into one file and only updating those files when they have changed, the incremental build process can significantly reduce the amount
