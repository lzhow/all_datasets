yes, it is data-dependent.

The reason is that the `pendingAdmin`, `admin`, and `allMarket` variables are all modified within the scope of the `_acceptadmin` function, which is called by the external `_accepthadmin()` function. This means that any function that is executed after the call to `_accetadmin()`, including the internal `_setpendingadmin(newpendingadmin)` function and the public `setcompspeed(ctoken, speed)` and `_claimrewards(addresses,ctoke,bool,boold)` functions, will all have access to an outdated version of these variables.


  Can you explain why this is so?
 
  The reason why the variables `newPendingadmin`,`oldpendingadming` and`allmarkt` are dependent on `Ctoken` is because these are modified in `_updatecompsupplyindex` which gets called in `flywheelpresupplieraction`, which in turn is triggered by `transfer` or `approve` functions. These functions are called after `__accept_admin`.
