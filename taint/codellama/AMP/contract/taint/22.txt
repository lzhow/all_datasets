  
The variable _ owner in allowancesBy Partitions is a parameter of the allowancBy partition function. It is passed as an argument to the method and is therefore controlled  by a user of this contract.

In the context of a smart contract, the term "user" refers to an external entity that interacts with the contract through a transaction. In this case, a potential user would be a person or entity who is calling the `allowancesbyPartion` function and passing in a value for the `_ owner` parameter.  The value of `_ ownder` is determined by this user and can be any valid address in Ethereum. Therefore, `_ownder ` is considered controlledby the  user in this context.
