  
No, the `contract state nftsSolds` is not dependent on `variable er712TokenAdress` because the state is updated in a different function.

The function is `function buyjay` and it updates the value of ` nfsSales` by adding the total number of NFTs sold. However, this function does not use the input variable` er17Tokenaddress`. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
