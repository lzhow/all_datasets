There is no direct data dependence between the `uint addAmout` variable and the  ` initialExchangRateManitssa` contract variable in this function. However, the `_accruteInterst()` function is called before the addition of the reserves, which may affect the value of `initalExchnageRate`. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether there is a direct dependency between these two entities without further analysis.
