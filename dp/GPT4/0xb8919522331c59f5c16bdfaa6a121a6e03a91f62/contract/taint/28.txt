Reason: The variable `_BEACON_SLOT` is a constant `bytes32` value that is defined in the `ERC1967Upgrade` abstract contract. It represents a specific storage slot in the contract where the address of the beacon contract is stored. This variable is not directly controlled by the user; instead, it is a predefined constant that is used internally by the contract to access and modify the beacon address in a specific storage slot. The actual beacon address that is stored in this slot may be changed by the contract's functions, but the slot itself is a fixed location within the contract's storage layout and cannot be altered by users. The control over changing the beacon address is typically restricted to an admin or through a specific governance process defined in the contract, not by arbitrary users.
