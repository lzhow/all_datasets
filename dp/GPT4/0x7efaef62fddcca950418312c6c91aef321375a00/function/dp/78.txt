Reason: The variable `feeOn` in the function `_mintFee` is determined by whether the `feeTo` address is equal to the zero address or not. This is independent of the `_reserve1` variable directly. However, within the `burn` function, `feeOn` is set by calling `_mintFee` and passing `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` as arguments. The logic within `_mintFee` uses `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` to calculate `rootK` and potentially `liquidity` if `feeOn` is true. This means that the value of `_reserve1` can influence the internal state changes that occur when `feeOn` is true, such as the calculation of `liquidity` and the potential minting of new tokens. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `feeOn` and `_reserve1` because the value of `_reserve1` can affect the execution path and state changes within `_mintFee` when it is called from `burn`.
