  
The label is 'Yes'.

In the `execute` function, the parameter `input` is passed to the internal function call `validateAndExipreAccountSiganture`. The `account` field of the struct `swapDescription` passed as an argument to this function is used to check the signature of `Account Signatures`.
However, `Protocol FEE Signatue` does not depend on `Amount` because the value of this variable is not used in any of its functions.
Therefore, it is data-dependent on variable amount.
