  
No, the variables ` protocolAmount ` and ` outputAmountChange ` are independent in function  ` execute `.

The variable  'protocolAmount' is calculated using the `getReturnAmount()` function, which takes the  `'swapDescription'`  and  the `'output'` as input and calculates the amount of tokens that will be returned based on their type and the current balance of the output token. This calculation does not depend on  any other variable in  function 'execute'.
On the other hand,  variable 'outputAmountchange'  is a local variable that is used to calculate the total amount that can be transferred from the input token to the caller. It is set to  `(Base .getbalances ( input .token ) - base . getbalancen ( output . token ))`, which is based only on variables  input  . 'token'   and output  '.token'. This variable is not used in any calculation that depends on other variables in ' execute '.
Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two.
