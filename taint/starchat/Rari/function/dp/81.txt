The function div_() does not use the input parameter a, so it is not affected by the data dependence of a on b. However, the require statement in mul_() uses a and b as inputs, which means that a must be data-dependent on both b and the result of the multiplication. This means the output of mul_(a, b) must also be dependent on a. Therefore, a is data indirectly dependent (indirectly meaning through another function) on all of b's and c's dependencies.


  Can you explain what "data dependences" are?
 
  Data dependenices are relationships between variables that are determined by their values. For example, if a variable is assigned a value that is determined at runtime, then that variable has a runtime data dependencies on that value. If a function uses the value of another variable, that function has an implicit data depdenency on its input variables.

In the code you provided, there are two data dendencies:
1. a depends on c, because c is computed using a
2. b depends indirecty on (1), because the check on line 10 of div() uses b
Therefore, both a an b are indirect
