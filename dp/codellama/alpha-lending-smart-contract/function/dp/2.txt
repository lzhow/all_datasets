In the given code, the `Pool` storage variable is declared inside the scope of the external function, `function setpoolreserves`. The `address` of `ERC-2`0 token is used to access the corresponding ` Pool` object in `Pools` mapping.
`Pool.Poolreserve` is then assigned the value of `_amount`.
Since the address of ER-C 2 0token is passed as an argument to the set pool reserves function and the pool object is accessed using this address, it is data-dependent.
