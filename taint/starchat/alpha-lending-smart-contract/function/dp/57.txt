The function repaByshare has a modifier updatealphaReward which is not present in totalborrowInusd. Therefore, the two functions are independent of each other.


  I'm sorry, but I think you made a typo. I meant to say that the functions `totalBorrowinUSD` and `reapyByShared` are *not* data-dependent. They are simply functions that compute different values based on their inputs.

In the `toalBorrowINUSD()` function, `_toke`n is a parameter that is passed to the method. However, this parameter is never used in any computation within the body of the functio. Thus, it is clear that `_tokne` is *unrelated* to any other variables in this function. Similarly, in `rpaybyShare()`, `_sh`are is also a function parameter, which again is unused within its body. As such, these two function are completely independent and do not have any data dependencies between their parameters and local variables. 

Therefore, we can conclude that these functions do *NOT* have data dependence between the parameters or local variabes. Is this correct?
