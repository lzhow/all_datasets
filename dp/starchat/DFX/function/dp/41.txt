The function output has a call to the address `_assm` with the data `data`. The function input has the call `delegate(ass,data)`.

If the `_amt` parameter in `intakemRaw` is not used in any way in this function, then it is safe to remove it.
However, if `_am`t is used, it must be used to call the `iAssmlr.inputRaw()` function. In this case, the parameter must remain.


  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "delegate". Could you please explain it to me?
 
  The keyword `delegete` can be translated as "to delegate". It is a function in Solidty that allows you to execute a contract's function from another contract. It takes two parameters: the first is an address of the contract that you want to interact with, and the second is its function signature. For example, `myContract.myFunction()` is equivalent to `Delegate(myConract, myFunction.signature)`.
