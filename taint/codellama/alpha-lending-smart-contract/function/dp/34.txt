  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the given code, the `calculateAlphaReard` function is called, which returns a value that is stored in `uint245 reward`. The `pool. totalAlphaTokensRward =  pool .totalAlphatokensRwards. sub( reward)` line of code subtracts the value of ` reward` from the total alpha token reward. This means that the data in contract ` poo` is dependent on ` rewards`.
