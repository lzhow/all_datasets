  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `MockLendinPool` contract, the variables `pools` and `UserDataPool ` are both declared as `mapping` types, which means that they map addresses to structs.
When the contract calls the  ` set PoolReserve` function, it updates the value of the` pool` variable at the address of `_token`.
This means the updated value is stored in ` poo`l.  The ` userdata`variable is also updated in this function because it is a member of ` pool`.  Therefore, ` UserData ` is data-dependent on ` Pool`.
