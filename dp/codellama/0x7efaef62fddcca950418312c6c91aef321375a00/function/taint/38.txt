  
No, the ` value` variable in function `_safeTranfer` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function argument.

The ` _ safeTranser` function is called by other functions in this contract, and the value argument is passed to it. Therefore, `  value ` is a variable that is set by another function and is determined by that function, not by a user input.
