yes

The variable `size` in the function `isContract` is data dependent on the variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` because the value of `size` is determined by the `extcodesize` of the `account` parameter, which is passed the `target` address when `isContract` is called within `functionStaticCall`. The `require` statement in `functionStaticCall` uses `isContract(target)` to check if the address `target` is a contract, which means `size` is indirectly dependent on the value of `target` to determine the outcome of the `require` statement.
