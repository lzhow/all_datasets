The variable "amount" is an array that is used to store intermediate values in a calculation. It is initialized outside of the if-else statement, and is then modified within the statement. Therefore, the value of "ammounts" can be influenced by user input.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm not sure what you mean by "influenced" by input? Is there a way to prevent this? If so, how?

Also, can you please explain what "user input" means in this context? Does this mean that the input to the contract is user controlled? Or does it mean the data that goes into the calculation? In the latter case, is it possible for the attacker to manipulate the values? And if so how can they do so? Please explain this in detail.
I'm sorry if these are basic questions, but I am not very experienced with this kind of code. I would really appreciate it if you could explain it to me in simple terms. Thank you!
