Label: yes

Reason: The variable `newImplementation` in the function `upgradeTo` is an argument passed to the function when it is called. Since this function is external and does not have any restrictions on who can call it (other than the `ifAdmin` modifier which checks if the caller is the admin), any user who has admin privileges can call this function and provide the `newImplementation` address. Therefore, the value of `newImplementation` is controlled by the user who has the admin role when they invoke the `upgradeTo` function.
