Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `cToken` in the function `repayBorrowAllowed` is not directly controlled by the user. It is an input parameter of the function, which means its value is provided by the caller of the function. The control over the value of `cToken` depends on how the caller sets the value when calling the function. Without further information about the caller and how the value is determined, it is not possible to determine if the variable is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label is "unknown".
