You are a Solidtiy Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. I will give you a Solidtiy code file. You give me its AST in Json format. Each AST node only has two attributes, type and value.
    
    The input file is 
    ```
    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract S {
  
   function f(uint a, uint b, uint c, uint r) public view returns(uint) {
      if( a > b) {  
         r = a;
      } else {
         r = b+c;
      }    
      return r; 
   }
}
    ```
