The variable `protocolFeeSignature` in the function `validateProtocolFeeSignature` is used to validate the signature related to the protocol fee settings of a swap operation. It checks if the provided signature is correct and if the protocol fee settings match the expected values or if the signature is still valid within the deadline.

On the other hand, the variable `marketplaceFeeAmount` in the function `getReturnedAmounts` is calculated based on the output balance change after a swap operation and the marketplace fee settings. It represents the amount of fee that should be transferred to the marketplace fee beneficiary.

These two variables operate on different aspects of the swap operation: `protocolFeeSignature` is concerned with the validation of the protocol fee settings before the swap, while `marketplaceFeeAmount` is concerned with the calculation of the marketplace fee after the swap. There is no direct data dependency between the validation of the protocol fee signature and the calculation of the marketplace fee amount, as they are part of separate logical operations within the contract.
