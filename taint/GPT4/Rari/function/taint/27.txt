Label: unknown

Explanation: 

The variable `name_` in the function constructor is passed as an argument to the `initialize` function, which is called through the `delegateTo` function. The `delegateTo` function delegates the call to another contract (`implementation_`). 

Without further information about the implementation of the `initialize` function and the contract `implementation_`, it is not possible to determine if the variable `name_` is controlled by the user or not. Hence, the label is unknown.
