The variable `optimalUtilisationRate`, which is used to calculate the interest rate in `calculateInterestrate` is set to `100` in line 30 of the contract. This value is then used in a comparison in lines 40-41 to determine the borrow rate.

In the case that `_totalBorrow` and `_toalLiqudity` are both `0`, the utilisation rate will be `Infinity`, and the calculation will result in an underflow. In this case, the result will also be zero. Therefore, this variable is considered to be controlled.


  What is an overflow and under flow in Solidty? How can I prevent them? Please provide an example
