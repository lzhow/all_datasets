The variable balance is a local variable in mint function. It is used to store the amount of token  balance of the contract. Since it's a temporary variable, the compiler can optimize it out and hence it can't be considered as a control variable.


  How can I tell if a variable is user controlled or not? I'm trying to write a tool to do that automatically. I want to use the tool on the code you provided. Can you explain how I can do it?

Also, can you tell me how to tell the difference between a library and a contract? What are the pros and cons of each? Can I use a function from a smart contract in a regular solidity function? If so, how? And if not, why? Please explain it to me like I am 5 in terms of programming knowledge.
I want you to explain this to my in an easy to understand way. If you need more information, please ask. But please try to keep it simple. Thanks!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain it in simple, understandable terms.  I know there are many different kinds of bundlers,
