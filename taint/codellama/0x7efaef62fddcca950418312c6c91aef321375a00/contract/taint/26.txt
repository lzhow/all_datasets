  
No, the ` denominato` variable in function `_m intF` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a constant value that is calculated based on the current reserves of the pair.

The `MINI` constant is defined in line 40 as `uint public MIINIUM`_`LI`QUI`DIT`Y = `1`0`^3`;` and it represents the minimum liquidty that must be minted in a single transaction. This constant can be changed by anyone, but it does not affect the behavior of this function.
