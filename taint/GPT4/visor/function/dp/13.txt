The contract state `_name` is data dependent on the variable `name_` in the function `constructor` because `_name` is directly assigned the value of `name_` within the constructor. This means that the value of `_name` is determined by the value passed to `name_` when the contract is deployed, establishing a data dependency relationship between the two.
