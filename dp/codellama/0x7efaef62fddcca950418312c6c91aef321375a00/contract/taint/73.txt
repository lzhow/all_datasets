  
No, the ` balance  ` variable in function `swap` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a local variable that is calculated based on the current state of the contract.

The ` swap` function is called by a user who wants to exchange a certain amount of tokens for another amount. However, this function does not directly interact with the balance of any user, but rather with its own internal state. Therefore, `  balance ` is a variable controlled internally by  the smart contract, and not by any external user input.
