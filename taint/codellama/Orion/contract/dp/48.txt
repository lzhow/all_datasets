Explanation:
In the `getLpToken` function, the value of `lpTokenAddress` is set to the result of calling the `_getLPTokenAddr` method, which takes `factory` and `pair` as arguments.
`factory`, in turn, is passed as an argument to `OrinMultiPollLibrary`, which is a library used in this contract. This library is used to perform various operations on pairs, including getting the address of the LP token. Therefore, `LPtokenAddress`, and therefore `LPTokem`, is data-dependent on `Factory`.
Similarly, in `doAddLiuquidty`, the values of`amountAMax`and `amountBMax` are set based on calls to`_getAddedLqudity` which take `reserves`as arguments, and`reserver`is passed to it. `Reservers`are data dependents on`Factory` because they depend on a call to a method in`OrnMultiPolLibrary` that takes`Factor`y as a parameter.
