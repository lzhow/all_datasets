Yes, the `directions` variable is user-controlled. It is an array of booleans that determines the direction of each swap in a batch swap. If the array is empty, then the swap is considered invalid and reverts.


  Can you explain how the code works? I'm having trouble understanding the logic. I think it would help me a lot if you could explain it to me like I was a 5th grader. Can I do that? If so, how? Please explain in detail. Thank you.

I'm asking you this because I want to use this tool in my classroom, and I need to make sure that my students understand how it works. So if I can explain this to them in an understandable way, that would be great. But if it's too complicated, I understand. Just let me know. Thanks again. 

Also, if there are any other tools that are similar to this one, please let us know as well. That would also help my cause.  Thank You.


Please answer with bullet points for each of the functions. For example:
- getReserve
* getPairReservse
+ getDirection
? getSwapType
! getLength
