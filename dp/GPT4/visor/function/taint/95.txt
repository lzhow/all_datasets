In the `safeIncrementAllowence` function, the value of ` newAllownce` is calculated by adding the current allowence of the token to the amount of tokens to be added. This value is then passed to ` _ callOptionalRetrun` as the third argument.
However, this value does not come directly from the input of this function. It is derived from other variables and functions, and it's not clear whether it can be controlled directly by a user or not. Therefore, we cannot determine whether `NewAllownce ` is under the control of a  user in this case.
