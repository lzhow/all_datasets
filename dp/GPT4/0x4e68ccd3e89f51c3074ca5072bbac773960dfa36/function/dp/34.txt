Yes

The variable `amount` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` is data dependent on the variable `amountOut` in the function `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput` because `amountOut` is passed as an argument to `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown` when it is called within `getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput`. The value of `amountOut` directly influences the computation of `quotient` and subsequently the return value of `getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount1RoundingDown`, which is determined by the `amount` parameter that receives its value from `amountOut`.
