In the constructor function, the `_oracle` variable is initialized with the value of the `oracless` array, which is passed as an argument to the contract. This means that the values of `_oacles ` are dependent on ` underlies`.
However, in ` add` function the same variable name is used, but it is not initialized. Instead, it's value is assigned to ` _oacles` using the for loop.
So, `_ oacles _` is data-dependent on `_underlies` because it uses the data from `_ underlines` to assign values to `_ oracels`.
