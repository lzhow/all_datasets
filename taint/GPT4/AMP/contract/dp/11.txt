Yes

The contract state `swapToken` is data dependent on the variable `_swapTokenAddress_` in the function `constructor`. This is because within the `constructor`, `swapToken` is assigned the value of `_swapTokenAddress_` through the line `swapToken = ISwapToken(_swapTokenAddress_);`. This establishes a direct data dependency where the state of `swapToken` is determined by the value passed to `_swapTokenAddress_` at the time of contract deployment.
