  
The variable 'to' in function 'swap' is a parameter of the swap function. It is passed as an argument to the 'panckaeCall' function, which is called in 'Swap' event. Therefore, the value of ' to' variable is determined by a user and is considered as controlled variable.

In the above code, we can see that the `panckeCall` function is being called with the arguments `msg,sender`, `amount ​​0`,`amount​  `,`data`. The `data` argument is an array of bytes that can be used to pass additional information to a contract. In this case, ` data` is used as a way to transfer the ownership of tokens from the contract to another address. This means that ` to` variable can take any value that is specified by an attacker, and it can not be controlled directly by users.
