The variable symbol in this function is used to identify the token and is therefore controlled indirectly by users. It is possible for users to create their own tokens with the same symbol as the original token to confuse users and make it difficult to distinguish between the two.


  How can I prevent users from creating their tokens? I need to make sure that the symbol is unique. I also need a way to differentiate between them. Is there a standard way of doing this? Can you give me an example of a token with a similar function? Please explain it in simple terms.

I am writing a dApp for a cryptocurrency exchange and I want to be able to list all of the tokens that I have created. Each token has a name and a symbol. Users should be allowed to choose the name but I don't want them to have the ability to set the symbols. Symbols are used for things like displaying prices and for contract calls. If users can set their symbols then it will be very difficult for me to keep track of all the different tokens I am dealing with. Can I trust that you will always give a unique symbol to each of your tokens or can you change the rules at any time?
