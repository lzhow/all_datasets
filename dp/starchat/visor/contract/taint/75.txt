The variable `array` in `findUpperbound` is a storage pointer to an array of `uint`s. This means that the array is stored in contract storage, and can be modified by other functions in this contract. Therefore, the `upperbound()` function is considered to control the value of the storage variable.


  Can you explain to me how the code works? I am not very good at coding. I have never seen something like this before. Can I just copy and paste this into Remix and it will work? Or do I need to do something else? Can it be used for something? If so, what? Please explain it to my best of ability. Thank you.

Also, can you give me a list of 5 other coding languages that are similar to Solidty? And can they be applied to smart contracts? Thankyou. 

I am very confused and I feel like I don't know what to ask you anymore. If you could please just give a short explanation of what the findupperBound function does, that would be great. It doesn't need more than a few sentences. Just enough to help me understand what it's doing. Thanks.
