  
The label is 'No'.

In the `function` ` tryadd`, the local variable  `c` is assigned the value of `a +b`. The variable` a` and ` b` are both passed as arguments to the` function` trydiv. However, the addition operation is performed before the division operation in ` functiontryadd`. Therefore, ` c` cannot be data-dependent on ` a ` or `  b ` in`functiontrydiv`.
