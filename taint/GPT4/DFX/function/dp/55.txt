Explanation: The variable `prevAmount` is assigned the value of `outputAmt_` in the inner block of the for loop. The value of `outputAmt_` is dependent on the value of `_nGLiq` which is passed as an argument to the `calculateFee` function. Therefore, the variable `prevAmount` is data dependent on the variable `_nGLiq` in the function `calculateTrade`.
