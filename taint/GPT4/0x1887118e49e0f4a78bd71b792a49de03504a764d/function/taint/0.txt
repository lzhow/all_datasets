Label: yes

Reason: The variable `_oracles` in the constructor function is an input parameter provided by the user who deploys the contract. When deploying a contract, the deployer specifies the arguments for the constructor, which means they have control over what values are passed to `_oracles`. Therefore, `_oracles` is controlled by the user at the time of contract deployment.
