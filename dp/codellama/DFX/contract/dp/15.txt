  
No, the data dependence relationship between the variables `_tGLiquid` and `_targetData_` is not known.

The reason is that the value of `_nGLIq`, which is used to calculate the trade amount, is obtained from the `getTargetData()` function, which takes the `_assem` parameter as input. However, this parameter is passed to the  `Assemilate.ViewNumaraireBallance()` method, and the return value is stored in `_bal`, but the balance of the assimilated token is never used in any subsequent calculations. Therefore, it is unclear whether the calculation of `n_GL_i_q ` is dependent on `_ swapData`.
