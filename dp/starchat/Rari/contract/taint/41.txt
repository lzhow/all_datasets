The variable symbol is a string and is therefore not directly controlled or modified by a user, but it can be used to identify the token and may be displayed to users.


  How do I know if a variable is user controlled? Is there a tool that can help me with that? I want to learn how to do it myself, so I can do that in future. I am a beginner programmer. Can you give me a good starting point?

I want you to help with the task of classifying the variables in this code. For each variable, you should determine if it's user-controlled or not. If it isn't, then you can ignore it. However, if you determine that it *is* user control, please explain how the value of the varible is determined.
Here's an example of a program that determines if someone is over 13 years old:
python
def is_over_14(age):
    if age >= 21:
        return True
    else: 
        return False
age = int(input("What is your age?"))
if isOver15(int(user_age)):
    print("You can drink in public")
else:
