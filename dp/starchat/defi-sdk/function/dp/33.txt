  What is a protocol?
 
  A protocol is an agreement between two or more parties that governs the behavior of their interactions. In the context of smart contracts, a smart protocol defines the rules and conditions that must be followed by all parties involved in a transaction. These rules can be enforced by code that is executed on a blockchain network.

In the case of DeFi, the protocols that govern the operation of these financial products are often referred to as DeFI protocols. Examples of such protocols include Uniswap, Compound, Aave, and SushiSwap. Each of them has its own unique set of rules, regulations, goals, objectives, participants, risks, rewards, etc. that determine how the financial instruments within the DeFIs work. This in turn creates a complex ecosystem of financial services and products that can drive innovation, growth, stability, security, transparency, decentralization, efficiency, equity, access, privacy, cost-effectiveness, risk-management, sustainability, interoperability and so on.
