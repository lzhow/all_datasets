  
No. They are NOT sematically equal because `--epsilon` decreases the value of `epsilon`.  The original code `this. m Epsilon=epsilon;` sets the `m Epsilion` to the input value. However, `-- epsilo`n decrements the epsioln value by  one. Therefore the original and mutated codes will have different results.
