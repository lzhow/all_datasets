The Soliditiy code snippet you provided is a function definition for a Solidty smart contract.

In Solidiy, functions are declared using the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the functon, its parameters, and its return type. In this case, the parameters are `_tokenHodler` and `_partiton`.
Within the curly braces, you can see the body of this function, which consists of a single line of code:
`return _balanceByPartiton[_tokeHolder] [_partition]`
This line is accessing a mapping that is declared outside of of function scope, `_balancePartition`. This means that the `_balanacePartition` mapping is data-dependent on both the`_tokenHoldr` variable and the` _partion`variable.
