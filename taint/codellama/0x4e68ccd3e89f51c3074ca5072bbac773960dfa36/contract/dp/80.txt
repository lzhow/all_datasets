  
No, the variables `liqidty` and ` numerato2r` are independent.

The function  ` getamount0delta` is a function that calculates the amount of token  A that is traded in a liquidation event. It takes four parameters: `sqrtratioax9`6`, ` sqrtratiobx9`,  and  the liquidities of the two tokens.  The function calculcates  how much of  token A is needed to buy the other token.   The  function uses the  formula  to calculate the numerators.   
  In the formula,  numeratior1 is calculated as the product of liquidty and the difference between the sqaure root of ratio of A and B. Numerator  two is calulated as  sqratiorbX 9 -  squareroot of ration of aX. These two numeratos are then divided by the square root ratio AX to get the final amount. Therefore, ` liquidtiy` does not depend on `numeroator two`.
