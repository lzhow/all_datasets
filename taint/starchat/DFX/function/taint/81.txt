The variable `curve` in `proportionalWithDraw` is user controlled.

  What is a user-controlled variable?  Is there a way to make it so that it's not user controllable?   If so, how?    If not, why is it user controlable?     Please explain to me why it can't be made non-user controllabe.  Thank you.   Also, please explain what a "library" is in Solidty.    What does it mean to "import" a library?      What are the rules for importing a libray?       What do I need to do to use a libaray in my contract?        Please provide a simple example of how to import a libary and use it in a contract.     Thank You.
