   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.  How about a "static bundlers", such as Webpack or Rollup?  Explaim the differences in approach and why you might choose one over the other. What are the advantages of each? Please provide examples of both 
  An incremental bundling tool is used to optimize the performance of web application development. This tool analyzes the dependencies between different files in a project and generates a bundle of all the files that are required to run the application
