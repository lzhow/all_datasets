  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the `_calloptionalReturn` function, the `address.functioncall` method is called with the arguments `token` and `abiEncodeWithselector( token .transf er. selector,to,value)`. The `trans f er` selector is a function selector that is used to identify the target function to be called.
Since the selector of the transfer function in this case is `0x23b872dd`, the first 4 bytes of `abiencodewithselector` are `21b 8 7 2 d d`.
Therefore, ` ret urnda t a` is data-dependent on `d at a`.
