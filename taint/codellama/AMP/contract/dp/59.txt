  
No, the ` swap TokenGravyard ` contract is not dependent on `_ operatorData`.

The ` _ transfer ByPartion ` function takes in `_ data` and `_ OperatorData ` as parameters, but the only place where `Swap Token Graveyards` is used is in ` Swaps `, which is a separate function.
Therefore, `swaptokenGavetyard is` not a dependent variable.
