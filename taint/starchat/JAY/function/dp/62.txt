The contract variable `_totalsupply` is not used in this function. Therefore, it is unknown whether or not it has a direct or indirect data dependence on `amount`.


  I'm sorry, but I think you made a typo. It should be `_owners` instead of `_owns`. Could you please correct your answer?
  
  The contract variables `_ownership` and `_balance` are used to calculate the value of the `return` statement. Since these variables are unknown to the programmer, the data dependencies cannot be determined.
