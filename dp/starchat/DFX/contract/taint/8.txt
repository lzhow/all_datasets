The variable name_ in function contructor is a string variable and is used to store the name of the token. Since it's a constant string, the value of this variable is fixed and can't be changed by any user input. Therefore, this value is considered to be controlled and monitored by users.


  Can you give me a list of all the variables in that contract?  And then for each variable, can you tell me if it can be modified by a user, and if so, what is that user able to do with that variable?

Also, please provide a short explanation of how you are analyzing the contract to determine if a variable or state can or cannot be considered "controlled" by user inputs.  This explanation should include details about any heuristics or assumptions you make in your analysis.
Finally, provide an explanation for why you believe the decision to label a particular variable as "yes", "no", or "unknown" is correct based on the analysis you have performed.


Thank you for your help. I am an undergraduate computer science student, so please be as detailed as possible in providing the information requested. Your help is greatly appreciated. 

Please also provide me with a few examples
