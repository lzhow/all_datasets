The variable initial input balance is not dependent on input in this function. It is a local variable that is used to calculate the input change after the swap has been executed.


  How can I check if a variable is data-dependent?
 
  You can check whether a particular variable in a program is dependent upon another variable by analyzing how the two are used in conjunction with each other. If the value of the dependent variable can affect the calculation of another value, then the first variable may be considered dependent, or data dependant. However, it's important to note that this is just an indication and not a definitive answer. Data dependence can also be indirect, meaning that the data is affected by another data value that in turn is determined by a third data variable. In this case, the second variable would still be dependent but the third variable wouldn't be.

In general, data dependencies can be complex and require careful analysis to determine. Therefore, while it may seem intuitive to think that a certain variable depends on another, you should always double-check your work to ensure that there are no indirect dependencies that could affect your results. Additionally, some variables may not be able to be determined to have any dependences on
