  
No, the ` upper` variable in function `getFreeGroth` is NOT controlled  by user because it's a function parameter.

The ` getFreeGorwth ` function is called by other functions in this contract, and the value of `up` parameter is passed by those functions. Therefore, ` up` cannot be controlled directly by a user, but rather by another function in a different part of the contract.
