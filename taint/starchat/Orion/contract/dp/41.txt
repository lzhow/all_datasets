yes, it is data-dependent.

The reason is that the value of `amount[n]` depends on `n`, which is determined by the length of the `path` array. Since the compiler does not know the actual value at compile time, the code must assume that `length(array) > n` is always true, which means that accessing `array[length]` is safe.

  Can you explain why it's data dependant?
