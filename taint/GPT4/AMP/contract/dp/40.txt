Reason: The contract state `totalSupplyByPartition` is a mapping that keeps track of the total supply of tokens for each partition. It is modified in functions that deal with the transfer, minting, or burning of tokens within specific partitions. The variable `_swapTokenAddress_` in the `constructor` function is used to initialize the `swapToken` state variable, which is a reference to an external token contract that the `Amp` contract can interact with for token swaps. There is no direct modification or dependency of `totalSupplyByPartition` on `_swapTokenAddress_` within the `constructor` function or elsewhere in the contract based on the provided code. The `totalSupplyByPartition` is affected by token balance operations within partitions, not by the initialization of the swap token address.
