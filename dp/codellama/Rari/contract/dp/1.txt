  
The answer is 'No'.

In the `set_ImplemenationInternal` function, the parameter ` become_implementationData ` is passed as an argument to the `_becomImplementaion` internal function. This means that the value of ` becoem_implementataionData  ` will be used to call the internal `_ becomeimplementation` method.
However, in `_ prepare` , the` become implementationData _` variable is not used. Instead, it is used as a parameter to `_ setImlementationSafer` .
Therefore, ` _ setimplementationInternal ` and `_ _ prepare ` are independent of each other, and the data dependence relationship between the two is "No".
