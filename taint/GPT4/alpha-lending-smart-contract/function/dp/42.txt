Label: unknown

Reason: The provided Solidity function `liquidate` does not contain enough information to determine if there is a data dependency between the contract state `pools` and the variable `_collateral`. The function `liquidate` calls `liquidateInternal` and two modifiers `updatePoolWithInterestsAndTimestamp(_token)` and `updatePoolWithInterestsAndTimestamp(_collateral)`, which suggests that there might be a relationship between `_collateral` and the state of the contract, potentially including `pools`. However, without the implementation details of the `updatePoolWithInterestsAndTimestamp` modifier and the `liquidateInternal` function, as well as the definition of the `pools` state variable, it is not possible to definitively determine whether `pools` is data dependent on `_collateral`. Therefore, the relationship is labeled as 'unknown'.
