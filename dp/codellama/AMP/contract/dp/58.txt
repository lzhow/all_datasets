The variable _ value in approval by partition is not dependent on _ allowedBy Partitions in increase allowances by partitions. This is because the _ amount variable in _ approvesBy partition function does not depend on any other variable. It is a local variable that is assigned a value and is used to update the allowable amount of tokens that can be transferred from the owner to the spender. On the other hand, the increase Allowance function increases the amount that the operator is allowed to transfer from one address to another. However, this function only updates the value of the local _ addedValue variable, which is then added to _ allowBy partitions to increase the total amount allowed. Therefore, there is no data dependence between the two functions.
