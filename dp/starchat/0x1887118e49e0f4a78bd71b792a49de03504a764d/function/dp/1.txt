The contract function 'add' takes two input arrays: 'underlies' (an array of addresses) and '_oracls' an array  of PriceOracles (contracts). The function loops through the arrays and assigns each element in '_oracle' to the corresponding element of 'underlying' in 'oraclse'.

If the length of the two arrays are unequal, the program will revert. If the 'canAdmionOverwrite' variable is set to false, and the underlying address already has a Price Oracle assigned, then the assignment will fail and revert the transaction.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the state 'oraclese' is data-dependent on '_oraacles' if the '_oralces' array is longer than the underlies array, or if 'cannAdminOverwirte' equals false and an underlying token already possesses a price oracle.


  Can you explain how the code works?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain in detail how this code snippet works. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what's happening:

1. We start by defining a function called 'Add' that takes in two parameters: an 'address[]
