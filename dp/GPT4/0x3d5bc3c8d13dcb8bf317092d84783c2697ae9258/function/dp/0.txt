Reason: The variable `amountSeizeError` is assigned the result of the function call `comptroller.liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(...)`, which calculates the number of tokens that should be seized during the liquidation process. This calculation is based on the `actualRepayAmount`, which is the actual amount repaid by the liquidator to the borrower.

The variable `repayBorrowError` is assigned the result of the function call `repayBorrowFresh(...)`, which handles the repayment of the borrow. The `repayBorrowError` indicates whether there was an error during the repayment process.

The value of `amountSeizeError` does not depend on the value of `repayBorrowError`. Instead, both `amountSeizeError` and `repayBorrowError` are independently determined by separate function calls and are not influenced by each other's values. The only relationship between them is that they are both part of the liquidation process and are used to determine the success or failure of different steps within that process. However, this does not constitute a data dependency as defined in the context of this analysis.
