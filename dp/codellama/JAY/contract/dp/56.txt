  
No, the state variable `_names` is not dependent on `ER1C512Ids`.

The reason is that the `_namess` variable is a constant string that is defined in line 3 of the code, and it is never modified or updated throughout the execution of this function. Therefore, it does not depend on any other variable or state in this contract.
On the other hand, `er1c 5 7 8Ids`, which is an array of uint 64, is passed as an argument to the ` buy NFT` function and is used to determine the number of NTFs to be bought. However, this variable does depend directly on user input, which could potentially be used maliciously to manipulate the behavior of `Buynft` and other functions in a malicious way.
