  
No, the ` buy Nft Fee Jay ` contract variable is not dependent on ` er c7 51 Token Address ` in ` Buy NFT s ` function.

The `BuynftfeeJaY` variable stores the amount of Jays that are burned when the user buys NTFs. This amount is determined by the current price of the JAI token, which is obtained from the Chainlink price feed. Therefore, changing the value of `erC 75 6Token Address` does not affect the calculation of` buy ntffeejay`.
