Yes

The contract state `nftsBought` is data dependent on the variable `erc721TokenAddress` in the function `buyNFTs`. The reason for this is that within the `buyNFTs` function, the length of the `erc721TokenAddress` array is used to determine the `total` number of NFTs being bought, which is then used to increment the `nftsBought` state variable. Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function buyNFTs(
    address[] calldata erc721TokenAddress,
    uint256[] calldata erc721Ids,
    address[] calldata erc1155TokenAddress,
    uint256[] calldata erc1155Ids,
    uint256[] calldata erc1155Amounts
) public payable {
    uint256 total = erc721TokenAddress.length;
    // ... other code ...
    nftsBought += total;
    // ... other code ...
}
```

As you can see, the `total` variable is directly set to the length of `erc721TokenAddress`, and then `nftsBought` is incremented by `total`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency between `nftsBought` and `erc721TokenAddress`.
