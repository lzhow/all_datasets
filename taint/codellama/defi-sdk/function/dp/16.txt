In the `callBytes` function, the value of `length` is calculated as `paires.lenght`. The value is then used to create an array of length `lenth` and assign it to the local variable amounts.
Then, in `function callbytes`, the amount of the first pair is transferred to `pair[1]` using the safe transfer function. This is done by calling the get amount out function with the parameters `fixedsideamount`, ` pair[ 2 ]`, and `direction[2]`.
Finally, ` amount[3]` is assigned to pair [3] using safe transfers.
