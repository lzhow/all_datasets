Label: no

Reason: The variable `baseProtocolFee` in the function `validateProtocolFeeSignature` is not controlled by the user. It is assigned the value returned by the function `getProtocolFeeDefault()`, which is expected to be a predefined fee structure set by the contract or its owner, not by an external user. The `getProtocolFeeDefault()` function is not shown in the provided code, but based on the typical pattern of such functions in smart contracts, it is likely to return a value that is determined by the contract's logic or state and not directly by user inputs. Therefore, `baseProtocolFee` is not controlled by the user.
