Explanation:
In the `depostitET` function, the amount of Ether to be deposited is passed as a parameter. This amount is then used to call the deposi`t` method of the WET contract.
On the other hand, in ` getAmoun`tsIn`, the amounts in are calculated based on a series of calls to the get AmountIn function. These calls use the previous amount in as an input, which is calculated using the current amount out and the pair and direction arrays. Therefore, ` amount` is data-dependent on ` amounts`In.
