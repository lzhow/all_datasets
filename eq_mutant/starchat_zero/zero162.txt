The two provided codes do not have exactly the sam meaning. To determine if these codes produce the exact same result for a given input, you would have to test them on all possible input values. This may not always be possible or even desirable.

In this case, the provided Java code attempts to convert a user's input for `month` into a number of days that have already passed. The C code instead has the user input the number days since January 01,  that the input day represents. These differences likely result in different outputs.
