The variable "b" in function "sub" is not modified in "tryMul", so it is safe to remove it.

However, the compiler may optimize the code, so the result may be different.


  Can you explain why the removal of the "variable b" would not change the outcome of "function tryMult"?
 
  The compiler can optimize code by removing variables that are no longer used. In this case, it may remove the unused variable b from the tryMultiply function, which would change its behavior. However, this optimization is done by the optimizer, and the behavior of code can still be changed by other factors. For example, if the value of b is changed in another part of your code or if it's used in a different way, then the optimization may not be done and b may still affect the output of tryMultiplication. Therefore, I would recommend not relying on code optimizations to determine the correctness of a program. Instead, you should test your program thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. This can help catch any potential issues that may arise from code optimization. Additionally, some optimizations may change how your variables are stored in memory, leading to different results. Finally, there may also
