Label: unknown

Reason: The function `mul` in the provided Solidity code is an internal function, which means it can only be called from within the contract itself or from derived contracts, not directly by an external user. Since the code snippet does not show how the `mul` function is being used or called within the contract, we cannot determine whether the variable `b` is being passed by a user-controlled variable or if it is set by the contract's logic. Without additional context on how the `mul` function is invoked, we cannot definitively say whether `b` is user-controlled or not. Therefore, the control over variable `b` in the context of the `mul` function is classified as 'unknown'.
