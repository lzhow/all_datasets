Explanation: The variable `pair` in the function `pairFor` is not directly used or referenced in the function `getAmountsIn`. Therefore, there is no direct data dependency between the variable `pair` and the variable `factory` in the function `getAmountsIn`. However, there might be an indirect data dependency between them if the `pair` variable is used or modified in some other part of the code that is not shown in the given example. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between these variables.
