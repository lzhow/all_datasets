  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `liqudity` variable is updated with the value of `self`, which is a storage variable. This means that the data in `liqduty` is dependent on `sefl`.
Similarly, in function two, `feegrowthiside0lastx168` and `fegowthisde1lastX26` are updated based on `_seelf`. This makes the variables `tokenOw0`and `tokwnOwe1`, respectively, dependent data.
Therefore, both variables are dependent variables.
