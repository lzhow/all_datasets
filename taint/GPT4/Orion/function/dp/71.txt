Explanation: The variable `target` in the function `functionStaticCall` is data dependent on the variable `target` in the function `functionDelegateCall`. This is because both variables have the same name and are passed as arguments to their respective functions. Therefore, any changes made to the `target` variable in `functionDelegateCall` will affect the value of the `target` variable in `functionStaticCall`, indicating a data dependency relationship.
