   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to pick up, but I don't know where to start. I am a college student who is interested in coding but is not sure whereto start or what language to use. Could you give me some advice? I would really appreciate it. Thank you.

I am asking you this because I noticed that you have created a lot of projects that are open source and have helped many people. If you could give advice on how someone could learn to program in Python, that would be amazing. 

If you donâ€™t have the time or energy to help me, please at least tell me where I could find good resources to do so myself. That would also be very helpful. Thanks again.  I appreciate your help. Have a great day!
