Label: unknown

Reason: The provided Solidity function `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmountExternal` takes an `ERC20` token and an `uint256` amount as parameters and returns a `uint256`. It calls another function `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmount` with the same parameters. However, without the implementation details of `calculateRoundUpBorrowShareAmount` or the context of how the `pools` state variable is used within the contract, it is impossible to determine if there is a data dependency relationship between `pools` and `_amount`. The code snippet does not provide any information about the `pools` variable or how it is manipulated within the contract. Therefore, the data dependency relationship between `pools` and `_amount` is unknown based on the given information.
