Label: Yes

Reason: The variable `amountInWithFee` in the function `getAmountOut` is calculated using the parameter `amountIn`, which is an input to the function. This input can be provided by the user when they call the `callBytes` function, which eventually calls `getAmountsOut` and then `getAmountOut`. Since the user can call the `callBytes` function with a value for `fixedSideAmount` that they control, and this value is passed through to `getAmountOut` as `amountIn`, the user indirectly controls the value of `amountInWithFee`. Therefore, `amountInWithFee` is controlled by the user.
