In the `SaferMath` library, the functions `tryAdd`, `add`, and `sub` are defined. These functions are used to perform arithmetic operations on unsigned integers.
  The ` mul` function is defined in ` Safer Math` and takes two arguments, ` a`and ` b`. The function returns the product of `  a `and` b` if the multiplication does not overflow, and otherwise returns  `0`.
   The variable` a  is used in both the` mul `function and the  function` add`. Therefore, it is data-dependent on `b`.
