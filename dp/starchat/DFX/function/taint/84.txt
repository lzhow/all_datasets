The variable owner in safePerimt is a user controlled variable.


  How do I know if a variable is user-controlled? Is there a tool that can help me with that? I'm not very experienced with Solidty





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your own development workflow.  How about Webpack? Rollup? Vite? Snowpack? Etc. etc. explain them all and let me know which one I should be using. I am considering using them in a new project. Thanks.

An incremental bundling tool is used to bundle together all the assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) that make up a web application into a single file that the browser can load. This makes the application load faster and makes it easier to deploy. It also enables better caching, since the bundled file is immutable and can be cached for a long time. Tools like Webpack, RollUp, and Vitest are examples of incremental builders. They bundle your code in an optimized way and enable you to take advantage of various optimizations like tree shaking, code splitting, lazy loading
