The contract state `_totalPartitions` is data dependent on the variable `lastValue` in the function `_removePartitionFromTotalPartitions`. The reason for this is that `lastValue` is used to update the state of `_totalPartitions` when a partition is removed. Specifically, `lastValue` is assigned the last partition in the `_totalPartitions` array, and then it is used to replace the partition that is being removed (identified by `_partition`) in the `_totalPartitions` array. This ensures that there are no gaps in the array after the removal. After this replacement, the `pop()` method is called to remove the last element of the array, which effectively removes the target partition from the state. Thus, the state of `_totalPartitions` is directly affected by the value of `lastValue`.
