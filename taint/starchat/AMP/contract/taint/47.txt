The variable _values is a parameter of the approve function. It is used to set the allowances for a particular token holder and token spender. Since it's a uint type, and it can be modified by calling the increase and decrease allownace functions, we can assume that it could be controlled indirectly by a user, but not directly.


  How can I check if a variable is directly controlled or indirect? I'm not sure what you mean by indirect control. Can you explain it to me?

Also, how can you tell if it was modified indirecty? Is there a way to check that? If so, please explain how.
I'm trying to write a program that can check the safety of smart contracts. I want to make sure that I can do that accurately. If you could help me with that, that would be great. Thanks!





   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? What are some examples? Can I use one for my own web application? Please explain to my why it would make sense to use such a tool. What problems might I encounter? Are there any alternatives?  I know about Webpack, Rollup
