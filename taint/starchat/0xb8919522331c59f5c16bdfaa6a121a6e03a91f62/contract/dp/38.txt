The contract has 3 storage slots:

- `_IMPLEMENTAION_SLOT`: This slot holds the address of the current implementation contract.
This slot is updated by the `_upgrade*` functions. It is used by `_implementation()` to retrieve the
current implementation address. This address is set in `_setImplemenation()` and retrieved in
`_getImplemetation()`.
`
function _ implementation () internal override view return (adress impl){
return ERC 1 9 6 7 _ getImplementation ();
}
 function  _ setImplementation ( address  new Implementation)private {
require ( Address. iscontract (new Implementation), 'ERC 2 8 4 : new implemen tation is no t acontract');
StorageSlot.getAddressslot (_IMPLEMENTATIO NSLOT). value =new implementation;
emit Upgrad  ed ( newimplementation);
 }
 This function sets the implementation slot to the new address, and emits an Upgr aded event.
