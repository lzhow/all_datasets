Reason: The variable `success` in the function `sell` is used to store the result of the ETH transfer operation to the `msg.sender`. It is a local variable that captures whether the ETH transfer was successful or not. On the other hand, the variable `_p_scope_0` in the function `updateFees` (which is not explicitly named in the code but can be inferred as `_p` within the scope of `updateFees`) is used to calculate the new fee based on the latest price from the `priceFeed`. These two variables are used in completely different contexts and for different purposes. There is no direct assignment or computational expression that would create a data dependency between `success` in `sell` and `_p_scope_0` in `updateFees`. The `success` variable's value is determined by the success of a transaction and is not influenced by the price calculations or fee updates.
