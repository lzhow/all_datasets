   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I have heard that python is easy to read and write code, but I don't know where to start. I also heard it's good for AI and Data Science. Is that true? If so, how do I get started with python for those things? I've heard some people say that it takes a long time to get good at coding, and I'm not sure if that's true. Do you have any suggestions? Or do you think it would be better to just focus on learning the basics and not worry about the specifics of AI or Data science? Please let me know what you thinK. Thank you!
