The `_setupDecimal` function in `ERCToken` sets the value of `_totalDec` to `decimal_`, which is passed as an argument to this function. This value is then used to set the number of decmial places for the token. Since this value comes from a trusted source (the contract creator), it can be considered as not being controlled directly by a user, but rather by an external entity (in this case, a smart contract).
