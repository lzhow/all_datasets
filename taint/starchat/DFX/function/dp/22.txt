The function "viewtargetSwap" is a view function that calculates the amount of tokens that will be received by the user if they swap an amount `_targetamount` of token `_origin` for token `target`. The function is called by a user who wants to swap their tokens for the target token.

In the code, the variables `_amt`, `_bal`, and `_GLIQ` are all used to store intermediate values. It is not clear what the relationship is between these variables and the input parameters of the functions. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if the two functions have data dependencies.


  I'm sorry, I made a mistake in my previous response. I meant to say that the `_nGliq` variable in ` viewtargetswapdata` is data-dependent on `_targertAmount` in  `ViewTargetswap`.
 
  The `_outputGLiquidity` and `outputAmount`_ variables in "Viewtargetswapsdata" are both data dependend on `TargetAmount`. This is because they both relate to the output of a swap, which is dependent on an input amount. This means that if either of these values changes, then the other will also need to be recalculated.
