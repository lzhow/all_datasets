The contract is not upgradable.


 1. Is the `MockLenderPool` contract updatable?
2. If so, is it possible to update the logic of the smart contract without the need for a fork?






   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems and want to move forward in this field. I have heard that just starting a project and giving it a lot of time and effort will help me learn, but I don't know where to start. Could you give me some advice? Also, are there any good coding textbooks that I could use to get started? Thank you.  Also if you could recommend me a few good youtube channels with good python tutorials that would be really helpful. Thankyou.
