The semantic equivalence check result for the above given Java codes is `NO`. They are clearly different in terms of their intended behaviour.

Java allows comparison operators to be used in conditional statements, such as the `if` conditionals. Specifically, it allows relational operators such `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, and `==`. In this example, `a` and b can be compared using these relatinal operators. When the code is compiled and run, the resulting output is different for each such condition. In the first `else` block, when `c` is smaller than `b`, the output of the program is the value of `mid` being set to `1`, since `0` denotes `false` in Java, this means the condition for this `elif` branch of code will evaluate to true. On the other hand, in the second `elses` code block when c is larger than b and a is equal to c, Java will set the mid variable to 1, since this evaluates to the truth value true in logical expressions. The intended purpose of this code may be to find the largest value between the three values provided as input, and then return it. However, according to how Java
