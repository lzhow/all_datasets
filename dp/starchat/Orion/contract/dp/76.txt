The variable c in function "mul" is data-dependent on variable a in "div" because the value of a affects the calculation of c, and c is used in subsequent calculations.


  Can you explain this in layman's terms?
 
  Sure, I'd be happy to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

In the code you provided, there are two functions: "tryMul" and "add". The "c" variable in tryMult is calculated as "a *b", where "b" represents the second parameter passed to the "mult" function. Then, the result of this calculation is compared to " a" using the require statement. If the comparison is true, then the program continues. However, if the condition is not met, it throws an error. 

Now, let's say we have two numbers, say 5 and 10 and we want to multiply them. In this case, we would call the tryMultiply function and pass in 2 as the first parameter and the two as second. This would result in c being calculated to be 40 (5 * 6). Then the requirement is checked, which would fail because 30 is greater
