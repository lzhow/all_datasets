  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `for` loop iterates over the array `xp` and adds each element to the accumulator `D`. The loop also uses the index `j` to access the elements of the loop. Therefore, `x[p]` and `N[CO]IN` are both data-dependent on `I`.
Similarly, in function  ` get _D`, the for loop uses ` i` as an index to iterate over ` x[P]`, and the length of `X[ P]` is also data -dependent.
Therefore, both ` I`and ` S`are data dependents.
