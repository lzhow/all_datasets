Yes

The variable `balance1Adjusted` is data dependent on the variable `_reserve1` in the function `swap`. The reason for this is that `balance1Adjusted` is calculated using `balance1` and `amount1In`, where `amount1In` is derived from `balance1`, `_reserve1`, and `amount1Out`. Specifically, `amount1In` is calculated based on the condition `balance1 > _reserve1 - amount1Out`, and then `balance1Adjusted` is calculated using `amount1In`. Since `_reserve1` is used in the calculation of `amount1In`, which in turn is used to calculate `balance1Adjusted`, there is a direct data dependency between `balance1Adjusted` and `_reserve1`.
