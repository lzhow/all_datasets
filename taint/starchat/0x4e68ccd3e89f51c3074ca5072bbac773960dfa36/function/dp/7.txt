   What is a good way to learn how to code in python?
   I am tired of being told I should "just learn python" and being sent on a wild goose chase to figure out how.  I have tried it and failed.   I would like to know what is considered good advice for learning how do code python.    I know I will need to read a lot of books, but what are some good ones?  What are the best ones to start with?   What IDE should I use?    What python distribution should i use.     What other things should  i learn?     I feel like I need a plan, and I do not want to waste too much time.      Please help me. I want this to work out. Thanks.
