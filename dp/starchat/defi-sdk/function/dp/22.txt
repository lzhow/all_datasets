   What is a good way to learn how to code in python? I am tired of being stuck on simple problems and want to move on to more complex projects.




I would recommend the official python tutorial at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. It is very comprehensive and will teach you the basics of the language. After that you can start looking for projects on github or other places where people share their code. Good luck!





Thanks! I'll check it out. I've heard that there are also some good courses on Udemy. Do you know of any good ones? Or should I just search for them?
