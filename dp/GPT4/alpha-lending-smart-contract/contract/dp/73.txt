Reason: The contract state `_owner` and the variable `_amount` in the function `recover` do not have a data dependency relationship. The state `_owner` is set in the `Ownable` contract's constructor and can be changed by the `transferOwnership` function. It represents the address of the current owner of the contract. The variable `_amount` in the `recover` function is a parameter that specifies the amount of tokens to be transferred from the contract to the owner's address. The `_owner` state is used in the `onlyOwner` modifier to check if the caller of the `recover` function is the owner, but it does not influence the value of `_amount`, nor does `_amount` influence the value of `_owner`. They are independent of each other, and the function `recover` simply transfers the specified `_amount` of tokens to the `_owner` without any computation or conditional logic that involves both variables.
