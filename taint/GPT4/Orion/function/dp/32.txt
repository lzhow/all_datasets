Explanation: The variable `c` in the function `get_y` is not directly dependent on the variable `factory` in the function `getAmountInUniversal`. There is no direct assignment or usage of `factory` in the calculation of `c`. However, it is possible that `c` indirectly depends on `factory` if the value of `factory` affects the execution flow or the values of other variables used in the calculation of `c`. Without further analysis of the code, it is not possible to determine the exact data dependency relationship between `c` and `factory`.
