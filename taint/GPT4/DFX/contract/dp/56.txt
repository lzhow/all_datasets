Explanation: The variable `symbol_` in the function constructor is not data dependent on the variable `amount` in the function `_burn`. The variable `symbol_` is only used to initialize the `_symbol` state variable in the constructor, and it is not used or referenced anywhere else in the contract. Similarly, the variable `amount` in the function `_burn` is used to specify the amount of tokens to burn, and it is not used or referenced in any way to affect the value of the `_symbol` state variable. Therefore, there is no data dependency between these two variables.
