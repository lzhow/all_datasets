  
No, the variables `from` and `pool` are dependent on `factory` but not on each other.

The variable factory is used to call the ICURVERegistry contract and get the coin indices.  The coin index is then used in getXp to get an array of x values. These x-values are then passed to the getY function to calculate the y value. This y-value is calculated using the amount passed in. Therefore, `getAmountinCurv` is dependent only on amount.
