  
The label is 'Yes'.

Explanation:
In the first function, the `require` statement checks that ` amount A >0` and ` reserve A>0`. The `mul` function is then called on `Amount A` with `Reserve B` as the argument. This means that the value of ` Amount B ` is dependent on both ` Reserve A ` and` Reserve B `.
Similarly, in function 2, ` require` checks ` Reserves A and B >`0. Then,` Ammount A. mul` is called with` Reserve A`. This also means `Ammount A is data-dependent on`Reserves B`.
Therefore, both functions have data dependencies on each other.
