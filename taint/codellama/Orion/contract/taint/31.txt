  
The variable 'user' in function 'doSwaTthroughOrinPool' is labeled as 'Yes'. The reason is that the 'swap' function in this function takes in a parameter 'User' which is a user address. This means that this variable is directly controlled or manipulated by a human user and is therefore considered to be controlled.

In general, any variable that is passed in as a function parameter and can be manipulable by an external user is considered controlled and should be treated as such.
