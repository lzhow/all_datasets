  
No, the variables ` tick` and `liquity` are independent in both functions.

The reason is that the `update` function in `_updatePositions` is called with the parameters `owner`, `ticlLower`, and`tickupper`, which are all passed as arguments to the `_modifiyPosition` method in ` burn`. However, these parameters are used to retrieve the position information for the given owner and tick range, and are then used in a call to `get` to get the current position for that owner. This means that any changes made to these variables in one function will not affect the other function.
