   What is an "incremental bundler" for web applications? How does it work? Explain the pros and cons of using one in your development workflow.

An incremental bundling tool is designed to optimize the performance of web application development by reducing the number of requests made to the server during development. This is achieved by bundLING (or aggregating) together (bundling) all the files that are required to render a web page, including JavaScript files, CSS files and images. An incremental build tool only updates the portions of the bundle that have changed since the last build, rather than rebuilding the entire bundle each time there is any change. Incremental bundlers are commonly used in web development workflows to speed up the development process and reduce the time it takes to see changes reflected in a browser. Some popular incremental bundle tools for JavaScript include Browserify, Webpack, Rollup and Parcel.js.
