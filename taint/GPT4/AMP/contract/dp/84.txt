Reason: The variable `_name_` in the constructor is used to initialize the internal state variable `_name` of the contract, which represents the name of the token. This variable is a string that holds the name of the token and is not expected to change or interact with other state variables in a way that would represent a data dependency.

On the other hand, the variable `_partition` in the function `_removeTokenFromPartition` is a bytes32 type that represents a specific partition from which tokens are being removed. This variable is used to update the balance of a token holder within a specific partition and has no logical or computational relationship with the token's name (`_name`).

Since there is no direct or indirect interaction or computation between `_name_` and `_partition` that would cause the value of one to affect the other, they are not data dependent.
