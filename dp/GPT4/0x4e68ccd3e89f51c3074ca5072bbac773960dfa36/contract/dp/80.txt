In the function `getAmount0Delta` within the `SqrtPriceMath` library, the variable `liquidity` is used to calculate the value of `numerator1`, which is then used along with `numerator2` to calculate the value of `amount0`. The calculation of `amount0` involves both `liquidity` and `numerator2`, and the final result is dependent on the values of both variables. Therefore, there is a data dependency relationship between `liquidity` and `numerator2` within the context of this function.
