The function `updateCompSuppyIndex` is a helper function for the `_updateSupply` function in `Comptroller.sol`. It is used to update the `supplyIndex`, which is an exponential moving average of the total supply of each ctoken.

In the case of `cETH`, the speed of change in supply is given by `speed = (total_supply - supply) / delta_time`. This is because the supply changes when the price of cETH changes. In the same way, the index of a cERC20 token is updated by the amount of interest generated by its underlying asset. This amount is calculated by multiplying the exchange rate of its cTokens by interest accruing in its underlyings.
