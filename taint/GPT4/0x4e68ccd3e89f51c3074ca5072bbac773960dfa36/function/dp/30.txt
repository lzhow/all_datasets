Label: no

Reason: The variable `_feeGrowthGlobal0X128` in the function `_updatePosition` is a local copy of the state variable `feeGrowthGlobal0X128`. It is assigned at the beginning of the `_updatePosition` function and is used within that function scope. On the other hand, the variable `amountSpecified` in the function `swap` is a parameter of the `swap` function and is used to perform token swap calculations within that function. There is no direct assignment or computation in the provided code that indicates a data dependency between `_feeGrowthGlobal0X128` and `amountSpecified`. The two variables operate within their respective function scopes and do not influence each other's values. Therefore, they are not data dependent.
