  
No.

The variable owner_ is a private variable in a contract, which means that it can only be accessed by functions within the same contract. It is also not passed as a parameter to any of the functions in this contract's interface, so it cannot be controlled directly by a user calling the contract functions. Therefore, the answer is no.
