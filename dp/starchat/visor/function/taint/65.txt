The variable to in safeTransfe is a controlled variable. It is passed into the safeTranfer function as a parameter and is used to determine the recipient of the funds. Since the parameter is user controlled, the value of to is also user controllable.


  How do I know if a variable is "user controlled"?
 
  You can check if it's user-controlled by looking at the code that calls the smart contract. If the contract is called by a user, then the variables are user controlable. However, if you're looking for a general answer, you can't really know for sure. A variable can be user or smart-contract controlled. For example, a counter variable that is incremented by each transaction is smart controlled but a mapping that maps addresses to balances is more likely usercontrolled.

In general, smart contracts are designed to be trustless and open to everyone to call. This means that the state of a smart contrac can change at any time by anyone. So, in general you should not rely on the values of variables in a contract to have any meaning. Instead, use them as part of your program logic.
