Yes, `_from`, `_partition`, and `totalSupply` are all state variables in this contract. `_transferFrom` and `_addToPartition` have data dependencies on these state variable.


  Can you explain how the data dependence is determined?
 
  In the code provided, the `_balances` variable is a mapping from addresses to uints, and the `msg` object is an instance of the Message type, which contains the sender address as a field. Therefore, it is possible to determine that `_balance[msg._from]` is data-dependent on `to`.
