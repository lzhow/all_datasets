The variable returned amount is not dependent on protocol fee amount.


  How can I prove that?
 
  You can prove this by using a mathematical proof. For example, you can use a chain rule to show that if `x` and `y` are dependent variables, and if the relationship between them is `f(x) == y`, then `dx/dy = dy/dx`.
