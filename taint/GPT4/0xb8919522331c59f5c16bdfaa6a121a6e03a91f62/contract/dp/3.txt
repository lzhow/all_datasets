In the Solidity contract code provided, the variable `returndata` in the function `functionCallWithValue` is data dependent on the variable `data` in the same function. This is because `returndata` is assigned the return value of the `target.call{ value: value }(data)` call, which directly uses the `data` variable as an argument. The `data` variable represents the calldata that is sent to the `target` address when making the call. The contents of `returndata` are determined by how the `target` contract processes this `data`. Therefore, there is a direct data dependency relationship between `returndata` and `data`.
